takeaways scotlands ambitious plan to expand its wind capacity and reach net zero by 2045 will require greater levels of energy storage plans to expand the storage and generation capacity of cruachan pumped storage hydro station from 440 mw to over 1 gw can help support a renewable future greater levels of energy storage can also reduce the costs of operating the grid and enable the greater utilisation of renewable electricity sources such as wind expansion plans for cruachan would bring as many as 900 jobs during the construction phase across the supply chain and continue draxs commitment to local communities and environments the project is a largescale and longterm infrastructure solution to some of the critical issues faced by scotlands electricity network the hit star wars tv series andor might be set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away but audiences in argyll and brute may recognise a local landmark on the titular distant planet cruachan power stations 316metrelong buttressstyle dam served as a setting for the space thriller however here on planet earth it has another big role to play in supporting scotland and the uks efforts to reach net zero emissions the pumped storage hydro station known as the hollow mountain complements scotlands wider strategy to expand its onshore wind capacity to 20 gigawatts gw by 2030 the plants ability to absorb excess electricity at times of low demand and discharge it again when needed allows it to play a key role in balancing and supporting the national transmission system as scotland and the rest of the uk move to a future increasingly powered by intermittent renewables ambitious plans to increase cruachans capacity to more than 1gw will also help create jobs in argyll and bute and support communities through the net zero transition scotlands wind power potential scotlands famously blustery wet weather and dramatic landscapes of mountains and lochs has long enabled it to pioneer hydro schemes along its rivers pumped storage hydro on its mountainsides and wind turbines on and offshore wind power contributed heavily to scotland achieving 97 renewable electricity generation in 2020  and with more than 17 gw of additional capacity in the pipeline scotland has the potential to be the wind powerhouse of the uk  in 2021 scotland exported 33 of its generation in net transfers to england and northern ireland having previously set a record 373 in 2020 however simply generating a lot of power isnt the whole story generating too much power can even be a problem for grids if there is nowhere for that power to go currently constraints in the transmission system limit how much power can be exported from scotland to meet demand in other parts of the uk when generators start producing these surpluses the grid operator has to pay wind farms to turn them off its estimated that wind curtailment costs added 806m to energy bills in britain in 2020 and 2021 this is where energy storage comes in offering somewhere for power to be redirected and reducing curtailment costs enter cruachan at maximum load cruachan power station can generate 440 mw enough to power 1 million homes when water from the upper reservoir is released flowing through the plants four turbines and entering loch awe below but when there is more electricity on the system than demand excess electricity can be used to power turbines that pump water up from loch awe to the upper reservoir where its stored until needed pumped storage hydro as this system is called offers longterm largescale energy storage to the uks electricity system helping to reduce costs and prepare for a renewableled future the largescale longterm storage solution since opening in the 1960s cruachan has only become more important in helping to stabilise an increasingly renewable uk while supplying ancillary services like inertia to the grid  the cruachan expansion plan to expand the facility and bring its ability to absorb and discharge electricity to more than 1 gw can offer a host of benefits to the grid and power to consumers across the country cruachans ability to reach full generating capacity in less than 30 seconds means that it can respond quickly to fluctuations in supply and demand when cruachan provides power back to the system in times of high demand it can in turn lead to lower peak power prices this becomes even more important at a time of high gas prices when ordinary consumers are feeling the impact of rising energy costs more than ever increasing cruachans capacity to generate and absorb power can help reduce transmission system costs and wind curtailment it also offers a zerocarbon source of stabilising ancillary services to the grid which have historically been provided by gas generators as the proportion of gas generation decreases and the proportion of intermittent renewables generation increases lowcarbon generators that are able to provide these services will become increasingly more important importantly the cruachan expansion is a longterm solution the expanded facility would have an operational life span of more than half a century significantly longer than the 1015 years offered by lithiumion battery storage solutions however there is a need for a financial mechanism to derisk the project for investors and offer value for money for consumers the cap and floor mechanism  which ensures generating revenues remain within a specific range is currently used for interconnectors to stabilise revenues by offering sufficient certainty to investors that income will cover the cost of debt which unlocks finance for new projects a similar mechanism could be introduced to support energy storage technologies that will be needed to support a renewable future such as the cruachan expansion the uk government must act quickly to implement the mechanism and realise the opportunity that storage can provide to the uk and scotland making the cruachan expansion a reality expanding cruachan is a longterm largescale project that will create a range of jobs and economic benefits and help support the local economy through the transition to net zero i am absolutely delighted that drax is progressing plans to expand the ben cruachan site says jenni minto member of scottish parliament this will not only support 900 jobs and create a pumped storage facility that will be able to provide enough renewable energy to power a million homes it will provide 165 million benefit to the local economy during construction in addition to 150 onsite local construction jobs the projects supply chain will create opportunities across a range of industries from quarrying and engineering to transport and hospitality the cruachan extension is a really exciting project and one thats really important for scotland says claire mack ceo scottish renewables it brings together a number of our really important skills including civil engineering and electrical engineering what we really want to see is a renewables industry thats thriving but also driving economic gain in scotland cruachan has operated in the region for more than half a century and has supported local communities through more than just job creation this includes a donation to the rockfield centre in oban to help fund a new community hub offering education as well as a social space following cruachans appearance in andor drax also made a fivefigure donation to several charities and good causes across argyll including oban mountain rescues efforts to create a rural defibrillator network  as well as lending a helping hand to local communities cruachans teams have always taken precautions to minimise any impact on the natural environment and preserve the areas biodiversity and natural beauty the cruachan expansion is an engineering project on an epic scale it will involve carving huge new underground caverns tunnels and waterways out of the rock below ben cruachan but in doing so it will create longterm opportunities for the local community and a key piece of infrastructure to take scotland into a net zero future tags battery energy storage  cruachan  cruachan expansion  hydro  pumped storage hydro  wind power storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero 28 february 2022 electrification key points energy storage plays a crucial role in the uk electricity system by not only providing reserve power for when demand is high but also absorbing excess power when demand is low the uks electricity systems growing dependency on intermittent renewables means the amount of energy storage needed will increase to as much as 30 gw by 2050 there are three different durations of energy storage needed to help balance the grid shortterm daytoday and long term it will take a range of technologies including batteries pumped storage hydro and new approaches to meet the storage demands of a net zero grid when you turn on a lightbulb  in 10 20 or 30 years  the same thing will happen electricity will light up the room but where that electricity comes from will be different as the country moves toward net zero emissions  low carbon and renewable power sources will become the norm however its not as simple as swapping in renewables for the fossil fuels the grid was built around weather dependant sources like wind and solar are intermittent  meaning other sources are needed at times when theres little wind or no sunshine to meet the countrys electricity demand equally as challenging to manage however is what to do when theres an excess of power being generated at times of low demand energy storage offers a low carbon means of delivering power at times of low supply as well as absorbing any excess of generated power when demand is low helping to balance and stabilise the grid as the electricity system transforms through a range of lowcarbon and renewable technologies the amount of energy storage on the uk grid will need to expand from 3 gw of today to over 30 gw in the coming decades  the storage solution even as the uks electricity system transforms from fossil fuels to renewables the way the grid operates remains primarily the same central to that is the principle that the supply of electricity being generated must always match the demand on a secondbysecond basis too little or too much power on the system can cause power outages and damage equipment national grid needs to be able to call on reserve power sources to meet demand when supply is low or pay to curtail renewable sources output when demand drops during the summer of 2020 for example lower demand due to covid19 coupled with high renewable output resulted in balancing costs 40 above expectations  there is a lot of offshore wind coming online in scotland as much as 11 gw by 2030 and a further 25 gw planned explains steve marshall a development manager at drax offshore wind farm along the coast of scotland its great because it increases the amount of renewable power on the system but the transmission lines between scotland and england can become saturated as much as 3040 of the time because there is too much power electricity storage can provide a source of reserve power as well as absorb excess electricity these capabilities are crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring that frequency remains within a stable operating range of 50 hertz as well as providing other ancillary services  whether its absorbing power or delivering electricity needed to keep the grid stable in energy storage timing is everything  there are three main time periods electricity storage needs to operate over fastacting short term electricity because electricity supply must always match demand sudden changes mean the grid needs to respond immediately to ensure frequency and voltage remain stable and electricity safe to use batteries are considered the fastest technology for responding to a sudden spike in demand or an abrupt loss of supply battery technology has evolved rapidly in recent decades as innovations like lithiumion batteries such as those used in electric cars and emerging solidstate batteries become more affordable and more commonplace this makes it more feasible to deploy largescale installations that can absorb and store excess power from the grid batteries are good for nearinstantaneous responses it can be a matter of milliseconds for a battery to deploy power says marshall if theres a sudden problem with frequency or voltage batteries can respond  its something thats quite unique to them the speed at which batteries can deploy and absorb electricity makes them useful grid assets however even very large battery setups can only discharge power for around two hours if for example the wind dropped off for a long period the grid needs a longerduration supply of stored power powering daytoday changes in supply demand and the grid when it comes to managing the daily variations of supply and demand the grid needs to be able to call on reserves of power for when there are unexpected changes in the weather or electricity demand from users pumped storage hydro power offers a low carbon way to provide huge amounts of electricity quickly and for periods that can last as long as eight or even 24 hours the technology works by moving water between two reservoirs of water at different elevations when there is demand for electricity water is released from the upper reservoir which rushes down a series of pipes spinning water turbines generating electricity however when there is an excess of power on the electricity system the same turbines can reverse and absorb electricity to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir storing it there as a massive water battery pumped storage hydro is a longestablished technology having been developed since the 1890s in italy and switzerland in the uk today there are four pumped storage hydro power stations in scotland and wales with a total capacity of 28 gw among those is the draxowned cruachan power station in the scottish highlands the plant is made up of four generatingpumping turbines located inside ben cruachan between loch awe and an upper reservoir holding 10 million cubic metres of water turbine hall at cruachan power station pumped hydro storage facilities can rapidly begin generating large volumes of power in as little as 30 seconds or less the ability to switch their turbines between different modes  pump generate and spin mode to provide inertia to the gird without producing power  make pumped storage hydro plants versatile assets for the gird how cruachan operates depends on weather says marshall we make as many 1000 mode changes a month thats how frequently cruachan is called on by national grid as the electricity system transforms there will be a greater need for flexible energy storage like pumped storage hydro this is why drax is kickstarting plans to expand cruachan power station however the specific conditions needed for such facilities can make new projects difficult and expensive cruachan 2 to the east of the original power station will add up to 600 mw in generating capacity  more than doubling the sites total capacity to more than 1gw by increasing the number of turbines operating at the facility it increases the range of services that the grid can call upon from the site longterm electricity solutions however storage technologies as they exist today cannot alone offer all the solutions the uk will need to achieve its net zero targets while technologies like pumped storage can generate for the better part of a day longer periods of unfavourable conditions for renewables will need new approaches in march 2021 for example the uk experienced its longest cold and calm spell in more than a decade with wind farms operating at just 11 of their capacity for 11 days straight  according to electric insights the shortfall in the countrys primary source of renewable power was made up for by gas power stations but in a net zero future such responses will only be feasible if theyre part of carbon capture and storage systems or replaced by other carbon neutral or energy storage solutions generating enough power to supply an electrified future as well as being able to take pressure off the grid and provide balancing services will require a range of technologies working in tandem over extended periods interconnectors with neighbouring countries for example can work alongside storage solutions to shed excess power to where there is greater demand similarly rather than curtailing wind or solar power extra electricity could be used for electrolysis to produce hydrogen  other functions may include demand side response where heavy power users are incentivised to reduce their electricity usage during peak periods helping to reduce demand to achieve stable reliable net zero electricity systems the uk needs to act now to not only replace fossil fuels with renewables but put the essential energy storage and balancing solutions in place that means electricity is there when you turn on a lightbulb tags battery energy storage  cruachan  cruachan power station  energy policy  energy storage  hydroelectric power charge recharge the evolution of batteries 23 december 2020 electrification from watches to toothbrushes mobile phones to cars batteries are a power source for many of our everyday belongings and while their beginnings can be traced back to the 19 th century their innovation has transformed industries technology use and society at large today energy storage systems such as pumpedhydropower have long played an important role in balancing electricity systems but as the uk and countries around the world seek to decarbonise industries and make greater use of intermittent renewable sources there is a need for greater levels of storage  while pumpedhydro storage requires the right kind of terrain  batteries can theoretically be built wherever there is the space and investment but what actually is a battery and how does it work turning chemicals to electrical flow batteries are comprised of one or more cells which store chemical energy and are able to convert that energy into electricity in most batteries there are three main components an anode cathode and electrolyte the anode and cathode are terminals for the flow of energy and are typically made of metal the electrolyte is a chemical medium that sits between the terminals allowing an electrical charge to pass through this is often a liquid but increasingly research points to the potential to use solids and create what are known as solidstate batteries how a lithium ion battery works its only when a battery is connected to a device that it completes a circuit and chemical reactions take place that allow the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the device but how much electrical energy a battery can dispense has always been a hurdle to using them as a power source making rechargeable batteries an important breakthrough the same reaction backwards a key element in battery development was the exploration of rechargeable cells these have long provided mobility and reliability in small scale outputs but are now being looked to as a source of largescale energy storage  invented by physician gaston planté in 1859 rechargeable batteries are possible because the chemical reactions that take place are reversible once the initial stored charge has been depleted via chemical reaction these reactions occur again but this time backwards to store a new charge battery charger with aa rechargeable batteries using a leadacid system plantés composition was similar to that found in rechargeable batteries used in cars and motorbikes today although the characteristics of these cells such as their heavy weight meant they were not convenient for many other uses as a result a journey of continuous research and optimisation to decrease the size and weight of rechargeable batteries began this includes investigation into the alternative chemical compositions found in batteries today  nickelmetal hydride and lithiumion to name two recharging in a lowcarbon energy system just as we have seen the size and capacity of batteries bettered throughout history the application and optimisation of modernday lithiumion cells looks to continue too powering the worlds move towards a low carbon renewable energy future from electric vehicle batteries with a million mile lifespan to a 200 megawatt battery farm in south africa  lithiumion allows reasonably largescale energy storage it can also play a key role in power grid stabilisation over short durations of time such as a few hours tesla gigafactory for the uk to run on 100 renewable electricity sources batteries would be imperative in complimenting other flexible renewables such as biomass and hydropower as a support technology batteries can help ensure a continuous supply of electricity to homes and cities even when cloud cover and low wind prevents other sources generating conversely charging and recharging batteries can also be used to absorb and store electricity when there is more sun and wind generation than needed avoiding surges in electric current or wasted generation changing charging woman charging smartphone using wireless charging pad alongside the advancements of battery capacity and composition the way we use them to charge is also changing just as bluetooth and wifi avoid the tethering required of wired connections wireless charging can increase mobility and remove physical limitations smallscale wireless charging is in use today many mobile phones toothbrushes smartwatches and earbuds now have wireless charging pads these use nearfield charging meaning the device must be in close proximity to the charger to receive power however efficient farfield charging is in development with companies like energous and ossia developing overtheair charging solutions for wearable tech medical products smart homes and industrial equipment this would mean devices could be powered and charged from many metres away the implications of this are vast for example your devices could be charged just by entering your home or office there could be less need for invasive surgery to change the batteries for pacemakers neurotransmitters and other implanted medical equipment this type of technology could also provide passive charging for electric vehicles the uk department for transport has announced a trial in nottingham  where charging plates will be placed on parts of the towns roads allowing electric taxis to charge while waiting briefly to pick up passengers as charging technology and speed continues to increase this might mean vehicles could charge wirelessly not only while parked but when stopped at traffic lights 3d rendered illustration of an elderly man with a pace maker as the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources batteries with continued improvement in performance and capacity will be crucial in supporting our connected lives transport systems and electrical grids tags battery energy storage  decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs how to make batteries more sustainable 16 october 2020 electrification batteries can be found everywhere in our houses in our cars and vans and even in the tech we wear more than just being pervasive battery technology has enabled a huge amount of technological breakthroughs  from the increasing distances electric vehicles can travel between charges to being able to store renewable electricity for when its needed these two developments in particular  emissionfree electric transport and gridscale batteries that can power homes businesses and cities even when energy sources are not generating  could be two key aspects in the transition to a zero carbon energy future however questions remain around batteries environmental impact whats in our batteries the batteries we use every day are typically made from a mix of metals and chemicals such as lead and acid as found in petrol and dieselengine cars or zinc carbon nickel and cadmium which make up some of the batteries found in the home then theres lithiumion the goto material mix for the rechargeable batteries powering mobile phones laptops and more recently a high proportion of electric vehicles around the world the surge in the production of lithiumion batteries over the last decade has led to an 85 price reduction  which in turn has encouraged the use of these reliable batteries in electric vehicles and largescale energy storage solutions while this is a positive step in the development of rechargeable goods it raises issues in the handling of spent batteries each year around 600 million batteries are thrown away in the uk alone  even rechargeable batteries have a shelflife while recycling allows the safe extraction of raw materials for use in other industries and products the majority of discarded batteries are left to rot in landfill sites this can lead to their chemical contents leaking into the ground causing soil and water pollution for batteries of any size to play a role in a sustainable future an overhaul is needed in preventing harmful levels of battery waste  the battery problem although the number of batteries that are recycled has increased currently the eu puts the recycling efficiency target for a lithium battery at only 50 of the total weight of the battery  connecting positive and negative terminals on a rechargeable lithium mobile battery standard recycling methods achieve this by separating and processing the plastics and wiring that make up the bulk of the battery pack then smelting and extracting the copper cobalt and nickel found within the cell releasing carbon dioxide in the process crucially these recycling practices do not typically recover the aluminium lithium or any of the organic compounds within the battery meaning that only around 32 of the batterys materials can be reused a lack of recycling facilities in the uk means spent batteries have traditionally been exported overseas for treatment upping emissions even further it is not only spent batteries that cause a problem the creation of them can be harmful too for example lithium mining can pose health hazards to miners and damage local communities and their environments in one area of chile 65 of available water is used in the production of lithium for batteries meaning water for other uses such as maintaining crops must be driven in from somewhere else impacting farmers greatly there are also risks around contaminated water leaking into livestock and human water supplies as well as causing soil damage and air pollution as a result teams across the globe are working to make the production and recycling of batteries more efficient and ecofriendly switching materials researchers based at chalmers university of technology in sweden and the national institute of energy in slovenia are developing an aluminiumion battery  this type of battery offers a promising alternative to lithiumion due to the abundance of aluminium in the earths crust and its ability in principle to carry charges better than lithium disassembling the battery from an electric vehicle ev the reduction in material and environmental costs that come with using aluminium over lithium might mean batteries made with it could offer more affordable largescale storage for renewable installations while more research is still needed to reduce the size and control the temperature of aluminium batteries researchers believe they will soon enter commercial production and eventually could replace their lithiumion predecessors elsewhere ibm researchs battery lab is developing a sustainable battery solution made predominantly of materials extracted from seawater a composition that would avoid the concerns associated with the production of lithiumion cells while the exact combination of materials in not public battery lab claims the new concept has outperformed its lithiumion counterpart in energy density efficiency production costs and charging time making good of the old along with advancements in battery development new recycling methods are also reducing the environmental impact of batteries german company duesenfeld  is innovating the recycling of lithiumion batteries used in electric vehicles through an innovative new process  batteries are first discharged and disassembled into their constituent parts the metals are extracted with a waterbased solution the liquid chemicals evaporated and condensed and the dry materials crushed and separated ready for reuse importantly duesenfelds method avoids incineration reducing the carbon footprint of lithiumion battery recycling by 40 and enabling over 90 of the batteries materials to be salvaged and reused in new batteries fortum  a finnish energy company is exploring a similar process  with the potential to recycle more than 80 of battery materials including cobalt manganese and nickel this year fortum signed a deal with german chemical company basf and russian mining and smelting firm nornickel to develop a renewablepowered electric vehicle battery recycling cluster in finland the aim is to create a closedloop battery production and recycling system meaning materials from recycled batteries would be used to make new batteries while it is clear there is a long way to go in reducing the environmental impact of battery production and recycling continued development of both batteries and technology can pave a path for a cleaner safer batterypowered zero carbon future electric vehicle battery pack ev fast facts from electric insights  electric vehicles evs on roads in great britain

anything its this the future of transport is electric but while evs may be the fastgrowing future of mobility their beginnings stretch right back to the days of the first automobiles today we associate evs with hallmark tech innovators like elon musk and his teslas but the original electric vehicle had a much more humble beginning  in a 19 th century workshop in scotland owned by a chemist named robert davidson  realising the potential of electric transport barking up the wrong electric motor tree by b bowers proceedings of the ieee 2004 using electricity to power transport has long made sense as a means of moving around quickly and efficiently robert davidson of aberdeen understood this as early as 1837 when he created his first electric motor  powered by zincacid batteries while davidson was a chemist he had a fascination with tinkering and engineering two years after creating his first motor he invited visitors to his electromagnetic exhibition where they could see a fully visualised electric model train capable of carrying two people at a time he would go on to develop a prototype dubbed the galvani which he tested on the edinburghglasgow railway in 1842 reaching a maximum speed of 4 miles per hour davidson overcame the hurdle of finding a battery strong enough to power a fullsized train by using liquid chemical batteries rather than solid ones however when they ran flat the chemicals had to be completely replaced there was a further spanner in the works when railway workers destroyed his locomotive fearing the move toward electric vehicles would put them out of a job it wasnt until 1884 that the first productionstandard electric car capable of being reproduced and sold to the public was unveiled the man behind this was thomas parker who was also responsible for electrifying the london underground his car was born out of a desire to minimise smoke and pollution in london a purpose which still rings true over 135 years later  more practical uses for these vehicles sprung from parkers initial foray with electric wagons being instituted in mines so their motors wouldnt pollute the air the parker electric 1890 invented by thomas parker the

wellknown car manufacturing names began experimenting with electricity ferdinand porsche  founder of the eponymous sports car  produced an electric vehicle called p1 in 1898 before creating the worlds first hybrid offering which was powered by both electricity and a combustion engine mercedesbenz also offered up an electric model called the mercedes mixte in 1906 this car was adopted as a taxi in cities and was even developed into a race car in 1907 no longer seen as a threat to the existing coalpowered transport the evs of the time were limited by the charge in their batteries but experienced a vogue as city cars for the rich who wanted to travel short distances in style sales peaked in the early 1900s when roughly onethird of all cars on us roads were electric but evs first golden age

entered its second golden age tesla driving towards onshore wind farm where are we now today there are over 273000 electric cars on britains roads  but this is set to grow quickly and significantly by 2025 its estimated there will be 1 million evs on uk roads  by 2040 there could be as many as 11 million most mainstream car producers are now racing to take the lead in the ev market from the headline grabbing antics of tesla to the petrolpowered stalwarts of volkswagen nissan and even ford and its not just the personal vehicle industry where electricity is racing ahead as a fuel source everything from innercity scooters to the rapidlyevolving aviation industry are being electrified  the first electric passenger jet could be ready for takeoff as soon as 2027 powering the way that we travel has become one of the most important conversations around the future of transport  and taking a look into the past suggests that this time electric vehicles are here to stay tags battery energy storage  electric vehicles evs what is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future 27 june 2019 carbon capture nasa museum houston texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional opportunity for the uks biggest renewable

balancing for the renewable future 6 july 2018 power generation its not news to say great britains electricity system is changing low carbon electricity sources are on course to go from 22 of national generation in 2010 to 58 by 2020 as installation of wind and solar systems continue to grow but while there has been much change in the sources fuelling electricity generation the system itself is still adapting to this transformation when the national grid was first established in the 1920s it was designed with coal and big spinning turbines in mind it meant that just about every megawatt coming onto the system was generated by thermal power plants as a result the mechanisms keeping the entire system stable  from the way frequency and voltage is managed to how to start up the country after a mass black out  relied on the same technology these ancillary services  those that stabilise the system  are crucial to maintaining a balanced electricity system ancillary services are needed to make sure demand is met by generation and that generation gets from one place to the next with no interruptions explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax because whats important is that all demand must be met instantaneously in todays power system however weather dependent technology like offshore wind and home solar panels are increasingly making up the countrys electricity generation their intermittency or variability is in turn impacting both the stability of the grid and how ancillary services are provided running a large power system with as much as 85 intermittent generation  for example on a very windy clear sunny day  is thought to be achievable it isnt a scenario anticipated for the large island of great britain but to deal with the fastpace of change on its power system which recently managed to briefly achieve 47 wind in its fuel mix  there is a need to develop new techniques technologies and ways of working to change how the countrys grid is balanced new storage tech takes on balancing services one of the technologies thats expected to provide an increasing amount of balancing services is gridscale batteries  one stabilisation function offered by batteries and other electricity storage options is to provide reserve at times when demand peaks or troughs this matches electricity demand and generation combined with their ability to respond quickly to changes in frequency batteries can be a significant source of frequency response batteries can also absorb and generate reactive power  which can then be deployed to push voltage up or down when it starts to creep too far from the 400kv or 275kv target depending on the powerlines the electricity is travelling along needed to safely move electricity around the grid the challenge with batteries is that the quantity of megawatt hours mwh required to compensate for intermittency is very large the difference between the peak and trough on any day may be more than 20 gw for several hours see for yourself at electric insights  the significant price reductions in battery storage apply to technologies with short duration or low volume mwhs these are the technologies which have been developed at scale recently but will probably struggle to make up in any large quantity any shortfalls in generation resulting from prolonged periods of low intermittent generation a challenge currently being addressed relates to maintenance of battery state of charge this is a consequence of battery storage having a cycle efficiency of less than 100 this means that losses from continuous charging and recharging will have to be replenished from the available generation to avoid batteries going empty and being unavailable for grid services ultralow carbon advances rather than relying on batteries to provide ancillary services to support intermittent generation technical advancements are allowing the wind and solar facilities  which are generating more and more of the countrys electricity  to do so themselves the traditional photovoltaic pv inverters found on solar arrays were initially designed to push out as much active or real power as possible however new smart pv inverters are capable of providing or absorbing reactive power when it is needed to help control voltage as well as continuing to provide active power the major advantage of smart inverters is the limited equipment update required to existing solar farms to allow them to offer reactive power control the challenge here is that pv is embedded in distribution systems and therefore reactive services they provide may not cure all the problems on the transmission system similarly existing wind installations have traditionally focused on getting the greatest amount of megawatts from the available resources but with fewer thermal power stations on the grid ways of balancing the system with wind turbines are also being developed inertia is the force that comes from heavy spinning generators and acts as a damper on the system to limit the rate of change of frequency fluctuations while wind turbines have massive rotating equipment they are not connected to the grid in a way that they automatically provide inertia however research is exploring whats known as inertial response emulation that may allow wind turbines to offer faster frequency response this works through an algorithm that measures grid frequency and controls the power output of a wind turbine or whole farm to compensate for frequency deviations or quickly provide increases or decreases in power on the system inertial response emulation cannot be a complete substitute for inertia but can reduce the minimum required inertia on the system even in a future where the majority of the countrys electricity comes from renewable sources thermal generators may still be able to provide benefits to the system by running in synchronous compensation mode ie producing or consuming reactive power without real power however what is vitally important for the future of balancing services in great britain is a healthy transparent and investable market for generators demand side response and storage whether connected on the transmission or distribution networks a market for the future grid one of the primary needs of balancing service providers is greater transparency into how national grid procures and pays for services currently national grid does not pay for inertia with it becoming more important to grid stability incentive is needed to encourage generators with the capability to provide it those technologies that cant provide inertia could be encouraged to research and develop ways they could do so in the future standardising the services needed will help ensure providers deliver balancing products to the same level needed to support the grid it would also benefit from fixed requirements and timings for such services bundling related products such as reserve and frequency control and active power and voltage management will also offer operational and cost efficiencies to the providers driving investment in balancing services for the future ultimately requires the availability of longerterm contracts to offer financial certainty for the providers and their investors bridge to the future click to view larger graphic for the challenges of decarbonisation to be met in a socially responsible way great britains power system must be operated at as low a cost as possible to consumers with new technologies almost anything could be possible but operating them has to be affordable in many cases it may take time for costs of long duration batteries to come down  as it has with the most recent offshore wind projects to take contracts for difference cfds and draxs unit 4 coaltobiomass conversion under the renewables obligation  ro scheme  thermal power technologies such as gas that has proven capabilities in ancillary services markets can at least be used in a

familiar vehicle combined with advancedartificial intelligence makes it a perfect symbol of a nottoodistant future which is fast approaching but what a scifi movie is unlikely to show is a selfdriving car pulling over for half an hour to fill its tank or recharge its batteries as autonomous vehicles gradually inch into our everyday life the question of how they will be powered arises as does whether they will be capable of refuelling or recharging without a helping human hand with governments around the world setting ambitious targets for the phasing out of diesel and petrol car sales its safe to assume the driverless vehicles of the future will be electric but will they be able to charge themselves more than that how would a large influx of these cars coming onto our roads affect our national electricity demand and emissions  how will driverless cars charge themselves development is already well underway to bring humanfree charging to the auto world with a variety of approaches being trialled robotic charging points the most straightforward way to enable selfdriving electric vehicles evs to charge themselves is through updating existing infrastructure adding on robotic limbs to standard charge points would be one way of removing the need for human hands tesla previously demonstrated a porotype of a snakelike arm that plugs into its vehicles charge points that does exactly this undercar charging easier than flailing robotic arms is the idea of charging cars from underneath a parked car unsurprisingly tesla has patented a version of the technology too while building the technology into the ground adds complications it could potentially allow cars to be charged while moving  which is exactly what one road in sweden is doing  the two kilometre stretch outside stockholm features a metal track that an arm under evs can connect to  much like a scalextric track the route is divided into 50metre sections which are electrified separately as vehicles travel over them sweden is now planning to roll the concept out nationally wireless charging a step up from undercar charging wireless technology uses inductive charging rather than physically connecting with the car  and can be installed into parking spaces or be set into the tarmac the problem with this is its not as fast as directly connecting with the car however implemented at scale entire roads could constantly charge vehicles when they need a top up it would mean that rather than taking evs home and plugging them in the city and roads themselves would charge it but even the idea of keeping a car at home might fade as cars become increasingly autonomous rethinking vehicle ownership as more of the worlds population move to cities and they grow increasingly congested car ownership is declining  a trend being further fueled by ridesharing services like uber lyft and didi chuxing in china and as services such as these continue to grow in popularity it could point to a future where rather than owning selfdriving cars they will be shared among urban populations lyft strategist raj kapoor suggested the reduced cost of maintenance of shared evs would make rides cheap enough for the average person to ride in every day  this could result in fewer cars on the roads as intelligent systems allow them to coordinate sharing across the population which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for charging however the more intense computing power needed in selfdriving vehicles means they will each use more electricity than a standard ev  powering these sufficiently will depend on technology and coordination rather than producing significantly more electricity smarter cars smarter cities smarter electricity changes in car ownership could mean the total reshaping of cities if cars dont need to park for long periods of times on central roadsides and in garages vehicles could instead be stored on the outskirts of cities when demand for transport is low and make their way into towns as people begin commuting this vision of cars seemingly independently rolling around cities to exactly where theyre needed depends not on a single car reacting to a single command but to a network of data points connected to almost every aspect of a city more than this theres even potential these cars could provide power as well as use it vehicletogird v2g technology means they can essentially act as batteries and return electricity to the grid when needed a fully connected network of autonomous cars linked to buildings cities and entire electricity networks could be used to help meet demand on a local or national scale helping avoid fossil fuel usage at times of stress while increasing ev usage will likely contribute to an increase in electricity demand selfdriving smarter vehicles will ensure power is used at efficiently as possible and reduce the number of cars drawing electricity from the grid it ultimately means global investment in the charging
