decarbonisation heating the future 9 april 2019 sustainable bioenergy we all want our homes and our workplaces to be warm and cosy but not at the cost of catastrophic climate change thats why decarbonising our heating is a challenge that simply cannot be ignored making decisions about how this is done requires careful consideration and a detailed deliverable national strategy here we discuss the key issues in decarbonising heat the numbers the climate change act commits the uk to reducing its carbon emissions by at least 80 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2050 as heating our homes and workplaces is responsible for almost one fifth of our countrys total carbon emissions we are clearly going to need to make huge changes to the way we keep our homes and workplaces warm in order to meet those commitments over 80 of energy used in homes is for heating  suggesting large potential for continued decarbonisation  energising britain progress impacts and outlook for transforming britains energy system  by i staffell m jansen a chase c lewis and e cotton 2018 improved insulation greater energy efficiency and electrification will all reduce the need for fossil fuelbased heating however domestic energy efficiency in the uk is lagging well behind targets although the situation varies from region to region  and such targets do not even exist yet for the nondomestic sector  roof insulation material even in a low or zerocarbon future were still going to need to keep our homes and workplaces warm  and affordably future policy against this backdrop in march 2018 the uk government issued a call for evidence for a future framework for heat in buildings chancellor phillip hammond introduced a new future homes standard in his 2019 spring budget statement  mandating the end of fossil fuel heating systems gas boilers will be banned from all new homes from 2025 a major change is coming but what else will we need to change in order to transform our heating systems 1 more electrification the most noticeable change in the way we heat our homes and workspaces in the future may well come from the need to switch from systems that fuelled by natural gas to ones that are driven by electricity some technologies that can offer a solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating depend on a significant amount of electricity to keep the warmth flowing for instance the hybrid heat pump scenario which is currently supported by the committee on climate change would see up to 85 of a consumers need for heat being met by lowcarbon electricity to give some context to that figure according to the committee  85 per cent of the uks homes now rely on fossilfuel derived natural gas for heating and hot water and on average these currently emit around 2tco 2 per household per year which represents around one tenth of the average uk households carbon footprint changing from a situation where our heating depends on 85 fossil fuel gas to one that depends on 85 low or zero carbon electricity is little short of a complete transformation given that the new future homes standard is due to be introduced in less than six years this transformation will need to happen quickly of course a great deal of the extra electricity needed will come from intermittent renewables such as wind turbines and solar panels  especially as the cost of renewable electricity is falling  much of that power looks likely to be supplied by distributed sources rather than those integrated into the national grid indeed since 2011 power generation capacity connected directly to the distribution network grew from 12 gigawatts gw to more than 40 gw by the end of 2017 according to estimates from energy experts cornwall insight in a report for our b2b energy supply business haven power with so much of our electricity reliant on the weather there will still be a need for dispatchable and flexible thermal sources and energy storage such as drax and cruachan power stations  their centralised power generation can be turned up and fed directly into the national transmission system at short notice to keep our heating running and our homes warm dam and reservoir cruachan power station scotland such a transformation will obviously require careful strategic planning as well as an enormous amount of investment there may well be no single solution to the challenge of heat decarbonisation rather a number of different solutions that depend on where people live and work their individual circumstances the energy efficiency of their homes and the resources they have close at hand but while it has previously been reported that the overall or system costs of electrifying heating could be as much as three times the cost of using gas another study suggests that the costs could be much closer 2 more heat pumps heat pumps that absorb environmental warmth and use it to provide low carbon heating have always been considered a possible option for the four million homes and countless workplaces that are not currently connected to the uks mains gas network recently expert opinion has been changing with hybrid heat pumps seen as a workable solution even for homes and workplaces that are connected to gas supplies indeed in 2018 the committee on climate change stated that hybrid heat pumps can be the lowest cost option where homes are sufficiently insulated or can be insulated affordably this means that they may be one of the simplest and most affordable options to provide the heating of the future hybrid heat pumps draw heat from the air or ground around them and use a boiler to provide extra heat when the weather is exceptionally cold in a low carbon future that boiler could be fuelled by biogas in a zero carbon situation it could be powered by hydrogen heat pumps can be airsource ashp  absorbing warmth from the atmosphere like the heat exchanger in your fridge in reverse  or ground source gshp gshps absorb heat through on a network of pipes a ground loop buried or a vertical borehole drilled in the earth outside your home or workplace both ashps and gshps can be used to support underfloor heating or a radiator system though neither will provide water heated to the high temperature a natural gas boiler will reach to keep radiators hot and even though the warmth they absorb is free heat pumps depend on a supply of electricity to condense it and to bring it back to the heating system inside the house this electricity could be generated by distributed power from local solar pv wind turbines drawn from batteries or even from the low carbon grid of the future it is worth noting that the size of heat pumps and the amount of land they require  especially gshp  makes them a less attractive solution for people who live or work in built up areas such as cities while for those who live in blocks of flats it is difficult to see how individual heat pumps could be a practical solution 3 more hydrogen the idea of switching the mains gas grid to store and transport hydrogen has long appealed as a potential solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating renewable hydrogen could then be burnt in domestic boilers similar to those we currently use for natural gas the benefits are many hydrogen produces no carbon emissions when burnt and can be stored and transported in much the same way as natural gas provided old metal pipes have been replaced with modern alternatives and given the sunk costs involved in the existing gas grid and in the network of pipes and radiators already installed in tens of millions of homes hydrogen has always been expected to be the lowest cost option too however according to the committee on climate changes latest findings  hydrogen should not be seen as a silver bullet solution capable of transforming our entire heating landscape in a single change the main reasons they give for this judgment are the relatively high cost of the electricity required to produce sufficient hydrogen to power tens of millions of boilers the undesirability of relying on substantial imports of hydrogen and the lack of a carbonfree method to supply the gas costeffectively at scale hydrogen could however be produced by gas reformation of the emissions retained by bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs such as that being pioneered at drax power station carbon capture use and storage ccus of which beccs is the renewable variant is supported by the uk government through its clean growth strategy as it has potential to accelerate decarbonisation in power and industrial sectors extremely rapid progress to provide hydrogen in sufficient quantities from beccs is unlikely  but the first schemes could begin operating in the late 2020s hydrogen production also has the potential to radically transform the economics of ccus making it a much more attractive investment  it was originally assumed that the power required to drive the energyintensive process of hydrogen created via electrolysis would come from surplus electricity generated by intermittent renewables at times of low demand however that surplus is not now generally regarded as likely to be sufficiently large to be relied upon it is these limitations together with a comprehensive model of the likely costs involved in different approaches to decarbonisation that led the committee on climate change to suggest that hybrid heat pumps could provide the bulk of domestic heating in the future at present it seems likely that converting to hydrogenfuelled boilers will mainly be an attractive option for those who live and work near areas where the renewable fuel can be most easily created and stored the north of england is a prime example  close to the energy and carbon intensive areas of the humber and tees valleys where ccus and hydrogen clusters could be located with good access to north sea carbon stores such as aquifers and former gas fields 4 more solar many homes in the uk  especially in the south  could be heated electrically without carbon emissions at the point of use solar thermal for water heating or solar pvs for electric and water heating common sights on domestic property rooftops the intermittency of solar power need not be an issue as the electricity generated could then be stored in batteries behind the meter until it is needed however the lack of sufficient daylight for much of the year in many parts of the uk could together with the still relatively high cost of battery storage  still mean that this would not necessarily be a solution that can be applied at scale to millions of homes and workplaces all year round as the cost of battery storage continues to fall  it may well be that solar becomes a more practical and costeffective solution 5 more biomass more geothermal sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets and biomass boilers have long been proposed as a potential solution to decarbonising heating for the many people who live and work off the mains gas grid bioenergy as a whole  including biogas as well as wood pellets  now provides around four percent of uk heat up from 14 in 2008 the main barriers to this are the current relatively high cost of biomass boilers this is currently offset by the renewable heating incentive rhi which the uk government has committed to continuing until 2021 as this solution is adopted by more consumers it is anticipated that the real costs of such new technology will fall as economies of scale start to take effect in much the same way that solar pv and battery technology has recently become more affordable 6 more geothermal ruins of a tin mine wheal coates mine st agnes cornwall england geothermal energy uses the heat stored beneath the surface of our planet itself to provide the energy we need while in some countries such as iceland  geothermal energy is used to drive turbines to generate electricity that is then used to provide power for heating it is envisaged that in the uk it could be converted into warmth through massive heat pumps that provide heating to entire communities  especially those in former mining areas there is already one geothermal district heating scheme in operation in the uk in southampton  it is envisaged that such geothermal schemes would work most effectively at a district level providing zero carbon heat to many homes and workplaces according to a recent report  geothermal energy has the potential to produce up to 20 per cent of uk electricity and heat for millions at present drilling is being carried out to see if geothermal heating could be viable in cornwall  however there is no reason why it could not be used in disused coalmines too where ground source heat pumps gshps would absorb and condense the required heat this means that geothermal could have strong potential as a solution to the challenge of decarbonisation for former mining communities 7 more chp cory riverside energys resource recovery facility in belvedere london could be operated as a chp plant in the future by using the heat created in thermal renewable electricity generation  such as biomass  in combined heat and power schemes businesses and individuals can reduce their energy costs and their carbon emissions such schemes can work well for new developments on a district basis and are already popular in mainland europe especially sweden denmark and switzerland warm homes factories and offices there are already a number of viable solutions to decarbonising heating in the uk they rely on smart policy smarter technology and customers taking control of their energy rather than any one of these technologies providing a single solution that can help every consumer and business in the country to meet the challenge in the same way it is more likely that it will be met by a number of different solutions depending on geography cost and individual circumstances these will sometimes also work in concert rather than alone the uk has made solid progress on reducing carbon emissions  especially in power generation  when it comes to heating buildings rapid decarbonisation is now needed and that decarbonisation must avoid fuel poverty and help to rebalance the economy  find out more about energy in buildings in energising britain  progress impacts and outlook for transforming britains energy system tags hydrogen  decarbonisation  customers  wood pellets  biomass energy can great britain keep breaking renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides towards a low carbon future but challenges lie ahead records might be harder to break but it is important the momentum continues to move towards renewable sustainable electricity explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report  commissioned by drax

energy policy  coal  electric insights  decarbonisation  electricity  electricity generation electricity and magnetism the relationship that makes the modern world work 30 january 2019 power generation locked in a parisian vault and stored in a double set of bell jars is a small cylinder of metal made of platinumiridium the carefully guarded lump weighs exactly one kilogram but more than just weighing one kilogram it is the kilogram from which all other official kilograms are weighed international prototype kilogram with protective double glass bell known as the international prototype kilogram or colloquially as le grand k the weight was created in 1889 and has been carefully replicated to offer nations around the world a standardised kilogram but over time le grand k and its clones have slightly deteriorated through wear and tear despite extremely careful use in an age of micro and nanotechnology bits of metal arent quite accurate enough to dictate global weighs and so as of may this year it will no longer be the global measurement for a kilogram  an electromagnet is part of its replacement an electromagnet is effectively a magnet that is turned on by running an electric current through it cutting the current turns it off while increasing or decreasing the strength of the current increases and decreases the power of the magnet it can be used to measure a kilogram very precisely thanks to something called a kibble balance which is essentially a set of scales however instead of using weights it uses an electromagnet to pull down one side because the electric current flowing through the electromagnet can be increased decreased and measured very very accurately it means scientists can define any weight  in this case a kilogram  by the amount of electrical current needed to balance the scale  this radical overhaul of how weights are defined means scientists wont have to fly off to paris every time they need precise kilograms beyond just replacing wornout weights however it highlights the versatility and potential of electromagnets from their use in electricity generation to creating hard drives and powering speakers the simple way to make a magnet magnets and electricity might at first not seem closely connected one powers your fridge the other attaches holiday souvenirs to it the former certainly feels more useful however the relationship between magnetic and electric fields is as close as two sides of the same coin they are both aspects of the same force electromagnetism electromagnetism is very complicated and therere still aspects of it that are unknown today  it was thinking about electromagnetism that led einstein to come up with his theory of special relativity  however actually creating an electromagnet is relatively straightforward all matter is made up of atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons spinning around them these electrons have a charge and a mass giving the electrons a tiny magnetic field  in most matter all atoms are aligned in random ways and effectively all cancel each other out to render the matter nonmagnetic but if the atoms and their electrons can all be aligned in the same direction then the object becomes magnetic a magnet can stick to an object like a paperclip because its permanent magnetic field realigns the atoms in the paperclip to make it temporarily magnetic too  allowing the magnetic forces to line up and the materials to attract however once the paper clip is taken away from the magnet its atoms fall out of sync and point in random directions cancelling out each others magnetic fields once again whether a material can become magnetic or not relies on a similar principal as to whether it can conduct electricity materials like wood and glass are poor conductors because their atoms have a strong hold over their electrons by contrast materials like metals have a loose hold on their electrons and so are good conductors and easily magnetised nickle cobalt and iron are described as ferromagnetic because their atoms can stay in sync making them a permanent magnet but when magnets really become useful is when electricity gets involved putting magnets to work running an electric current through a material with a weak hold on its electrons causes them to align creating an electromagnetic field because of the relationships between electric and magnetic fields the strength of the electromagnet can also be altered by increasing or decreasing the current while switching the flow of the current will flip its north and south poles having this much control over a magnetic field makes it very useful in everyday life including how we generate electricity find out how we rewind a generator core in a clean room at the heart of drax power station inside each of the six generator cores at drax power station is a 120tonne rotor  when a voltage is applied this piece of equipment becomes a massive electromagnet when steam powers the turbines to rotate it at 3000 rpm the rotors very powerful magnetic field knocks electrons in the copper bars of the surrounding stator out of place sending them zooming through the metal in turn generating an electrical current that is sent out to the grid the 660 megawatts mw of active power draxs unit 1 can export into the national transmission system is enough to power 13 million homes for an hour beyond just producing electricity however electromagnets are also used to make it useful to everyday life almost anything electric that depends on moving parts from pumping loud speakers to circuit breakers to the motors of electric cars depend on electromagnets as more decarbonisation efforts lead to greater electrification of areas like transport  electromagnets will remain vital to daily life into the future tags electricity  technology  transport  decarbonisation  electricity generation  electric vehicles evs how to get more evs on the roads 25 january 2019 electrification from school runs to goods deliveries getting from a to b is crucial to life in modern britain however a progress report by the committee on climate change ccc found that in 2017 transport was the largest greenhouse gas ghgemitting sector in the uk accounting for 28 of total emissions within domestic transport cars  vans and hgvs are the three most significant sources of emissions accounting for 87 of the sectors emissions a zero carbon future relies on a major shift away from petrol and diesel engines to electric transport a recent report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax examines the decarbonisation efforts of 25 major countries the report found the uk ranked sixth in sales of new electric vehicles evs in the 12 months to september 2018 and seventh for the number of charging points available the governments road to zero strategy outlines the countrys target for as many as 70 of new car sales to be ultralow emission by 2030 alongside up to 40 of new vans it has however been criticised by the committee on climate change as not being ambitious enough  a committee of mps has suggested 2032 becomes the official target date for banning new petrol and diesel cars  rather than 2040 called for in the strategy even as the range of evs on the market grows getting more lowemission vehicles on roads will require incentives and infrastructure improvements heres how some of the countries leading the shift to electrified transport are driving adoption expanding charging infrastructure one of major barriers to ev adoption is a lack of public charging facilitates coupled with reliability issues across a network that includes both old hardware and a plethora of apps and different connections  no one wants to set off on a long journey unsure of whether theyll be able to find a recharging point before their battery goes flat according to the energy revolution report there is one charger for every 5000 people in the uk compared to one for every 500 people in norway the leading country for charging points the scandinavian countrys government has invested heavily in its policy of placing two fast charging stations for every 50 km of main road covering 100 of the cost of installation government support has also been crucial in second and third ranked countries the netherlands and sweden respectively the dutch living lab smart charging is a collaboration between government and private organisations to use wind and solar to change vehicles while sweden has combined its klimatklivet investment scheme for both public and private charge points with experiments such as charging roads  china where half of the worlds 300000 charge points are located has issued a directive calling for the construction of 48 million electric charging points around the country by 2020  its also assisting private investments to make charging stations more financially viable the uks road to zero strategy is to expand charging infrastructure through a 400 million joint investment fund with private investors draxs energising britain report found the uk is on track to meet its 2030 target of 28000 installed chargers ahead of time however deployment still clusters around london the south east and scotland more direct government incentives or policies may be needed to balance this disparity and in the uk the scottish government is leading the pack with a 2032 ban on new petrol and diesel cars plus a range of initiatives including public charging networks and the switched on towns and city fund  charging points are necessary for electrified roads however its a chickenandegg situation more chargers dont mean more evs getting more evs on roads also requires financial incentive money makes the wheels go around putting infrastructure in place is one thing but the reality is evs are expensive especially new ones and cold hard cash is an important driver of adoption financial incentives have been a part of norways policies since the 1980s with the countrys high fuel prices  compared to the us for example further helping to make evs attractive current benefits for ev owners include no import or purchase taxes no vat no road tax no road tolls half price on ferries and free municipal parking there are also nonfinancial incentives such as buslane usage sweden the second ranked country for new ev sales in 2018 is a similar case where high fuel prices are combined with a carrotandstick approach of subsidies for evs and rising road taxes for fossil fuelpowered vehicles including hybrids the uk has had a grant scheme in place since 2011 but last year removed hybrid vehicles from eligibility and dropped the maximum grant for new ev buyers from 4500 to 3500  evs are also exempt from road taxes in april 2019 transport for london is implementing a low emissions zone ulez which exempts evs from a daily charge subsidies for both buyers and vehicle manufacturers have been a cornerstone of chinas policies with support coming up to around 15000 per vehicle  chinese ev buyers can also skip the lottery system for new license plates the country has in place to reduce congestion heavy subsidies have allowed the country to claim as much as 50 of the entire ev passenger market however it makes change expensive and the government is now preparing to find a more sustainable way of driving adoption preparing for transport beyond subsidies china isnt afraid to strongarm manufacturers into building more evs companies with annual sales of more than 30000 vehicles are required to meet a quota of at least 10 evs or hybrids  however the government has begun to scale back subsidies in the hope it will drive innovation in areas such as batteries robotics and automation which will in turn reduce the price for end consumers norway which owes so much of its decarbonisation leadership in lowcarbon transport to subsidies is also grappling with how to move away from this model as evs creep increasingly towards the norm the taxes lost through evs exclusions become more economically noticeable while the government says the subsidies will remain in place until at least 2020 different political parties are calling to make the market commercially viable  there is also concern the schemes only pass on savings to those who can afford new ev models  rather than the wider population who face higher taxes for being unable to upgrade its not just governments responsibility to make new markets for evs sustainable but for business to innovate within the area too drax group ceo will gardiner recently said his company must help to  ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution  thats a view welcomed by

clean growth minister claire perry spoke at an aldersgate group event in london in january its been very easy in the past for concerns about the climate to be dismissed as the worries of the few not the many luckily weve been able to strip out a lot of the myths surrounding decarbonisation and costs but we have to be mindful that this is a problem which will have to be solved by the many not just the middle class many countries have set ambitious targets for when the ban of new petrol and diesel vehicles will come into effect government involvement and subsidies will be crucial but may prove

december 2018 power generation since the paris agreement came into effect in november 2016 its fair to say many countries have taken up the vital challenge of decarbonisation in earnest however not all are making progress at the same rate many are not implementing the agreement at the pace needed to mitigate climate change and keep the average global temperature increase well below 2 o c of preindustrial levels certainly not enough to limit the increase to 15 o c by 2050 which the majority of climate scientists believe is necessary for the planet is to avoid dire consequences last year even saw renewable energy investment fall 7  while the money going into fossil fuels grew for the first time since 2014 and data released by the international energy agency iea at the beginning of this months un climate change conference cop24 in katowice poland found that 2017 was also the first for five years seeing an increase in advanced economies carbon emissions  despite this there is much positive work towards decarbonisation a new report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax looks into the core areas and activities required to decarbonise the global energy system  and which countries are performing them to good effect in doing this the report also looks at how the uk stands in comparison and what steps countries need to take to truly decarbonise here are the key indicators of decarbonisation and how countries around the world are performing towards them dam in hardangervidda norway clean power at the forefront of reducing emissions and curbing climate change is the need to decarbonise electricity generation and move towards renewable sources last year the global average carbon intensity was 440 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatthour gkwh out of the 25 major countries the report tracks 16 came in below average with seven of these falling under the longterm 50 gkwh goal leading the rankings are norway france and new zealand which have a nearzero carbon intensity for electricity generation thanks to extensive hydro and nuclear power capacity at the other end of the table china india poland and south africa remain wedded to coal producing up to twice the global average co 2 for electricity generation this comes despite china having installed two and a half times more renewables than any other country  it now boasts 600 gigawatts gw of renewable capacity per person germany is leading the renewablesdrive with almost 1 kw of wind and solar capacity installed per person over the last decade despite this as much as 40 of its electricity still comes from coal part of the challenge in moving away from coal to renewables is economic as many countries continue to subsidise their coal industries to keep electricity affordable phasing out these subsidies is therefore key to switching to a lowcarbon generation system doing this works as demonstrated by the example of denmark which cut its fossil fuel subsidies by 90 over the past decade in turn successfully cutting its coal generation by 25 the uks carbon pricing strategy  which adds 16 per tonne of co 2 emitted on top of the price set by the european emissions trading system eu ets has led the carbon intensity of great britains electricity to more than halve in a decade it highlights how quickly and effectively these kinds of fees can make fossil fuels uneconomical since 2008 the uk has removed more than 250 gkwh from its electricity production carbon capture and storage in many future looking climate scenarios keeping the earths temperature below a 2 o c increase depends on extensive deployment of carbon capture technology  capturing as much as 100 billion tonnes of co 2 per year storing and using carbon is clearly forecast to be a major part of any attempt to meet the paris agreement but at present there are few facilities carrying it out at scale around the world today there are 18 largescale carbon capture and storage ccs units running across six countries with a total capacity to capture 32 million tonnes of co 2 per year mtco 2 pa another five facilities are under construction in three countries to add another 7 mtco 2 pa of global capacity in the uk drax power station is piloting a bioenergy carbon capture and storage programme that could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station  the usa has the greatest total installed capacity at 20 mtco 2 pa but per person it ranks behind norway canada and australia their smaller populations give them more than 200 kg of carbon capture capacity per person per year oil platform off the coast of australia these figures are well below the 100 billion tonnes the iea estimates need to be stored by 2060 to prevent temperatures reaching 2 o c more however considering the us alone has a potential storage capacity of more than 10 trillion tonnes of co 2  the potential of storage is not expected to be a problem using depleted oil or natural gas fields as storage for captured carbon is being explored in a number of regions with the us establishing several projects with more than 1 million tonnes in capacity in 2019 australia will open the worlds largest co 2 store with the capacity to capture between 34 million and 4 million tonnes a year from chevrons gorgon gas facility  considering the storage capacity available globally its a matter of deploying the necessary technology for ccs to have a significant impact on emissions and global warming the uk is perhaps a typical example of where ccs is at present with estimated storage capacity of 70 billion tonnes as much as half of the entire eu combined by repurposing north sea oil and gas fields in partnership with norway the uk could pool its carbon storage capacity electrification electricity generation is one of the main targets for emissions reductions globally as a result of the progress thats been made in this field many futurelooking scenarios highlight the important of electrification in other sectors such as transport in turn making them less carbon intensive transport is leading the charge globally  there are now 10 different countries where one of every 50 new vehicles sold is electric in norway this ratio is almost one in two thanks in part to generous tax exemptions as well as nonfinancial incentives like access to bus lanes and halfprice ferries perhaps surprisingly china is the worlds largest electric vehicle ev market it may still use significant amounts of coal but its commitment to reducing urban air pollution has seen it push evs heavily and it now accounts for 50 of the global battery ev market on its own chinese electric car charging stations of course adoption of evs requires the supporting infrastructure to be truly successful in conjunction with its high sales norway leads the way in charging points per capita with one for every 500 people this compares to one charger for every 5000 people in the uk and one for every 10000 people in china electrification also affects the energy intensity of countrys transport systems and while it may be the largest ev market chinas rise in private vehicles has been largely driven by petrol and diesel models the result is the largest increases in transport energy intensity and emissions has taken place in china indonesia and india respectively domestic energy intensity is also rising in china indonesia and south africa as greater numbers of people gain access to appliances and home comforts conversely in europe portugal germany and the netherlands have all seen their domestic energy intensity drop in the last decade however this may be the lingering effect of the 2008 recession rather than longterm efficiency improvements the efficiency of industrial processes is also an important barometer in decarbonisation activities like mining and manufacturing require heavyduty dieselpowered machinery and often coalpowered generators especially in bric nations the exception is china where plans to get the 1000 most energyintensive companies to reduce their energy consumption per unit of gdp produced by 20 over the last five years has proved fruitful norways heavilyelectrified industries however are still energy intensive and its level of carbon intensity is vulnerable to fluctuations in power generation prices electrification and reduced emissions require government policies to put in motion behavioural changes that can lead to lasting decarbonisation  robust carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future  drax group ceo will gardiner commented recently  welcoming a november report by the energy transitions commission gardiner said

while others increase consumption as their population become wealthier residential and transport changes over the last decade are mostly linked to the global recession and technological improvements

agreement  and so it should be decarbonisation is crucial to keeping global warming below 2 o c and avoiding or at least mitigating potentially dire consequences for our planet its people and biodiversity however centuries of pumping out carbon dioxide co 2  from factories vehicles and power plants means its not enough just to reduce output countries must also work on co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere implemented at scale whats also known as greenhouse gas removal ggr could mean a country or facility removing more co 2 than it emits  effectively giving it negative emissions achieving this is not only advantageous to combating climate change its essential a new report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc explores 116 scenarios in which global warming is kept to 15 o c of preindustrial levels more ambitious than the paris agreements 2 o c of these scenarios 101 use negative emissions technologies nets at a scale of between 100 to 1000 gigatonnes  over the 21st century given the scale of the ambition the task of capturing enough carbon to be truly negative will need to rely on many sources here are some of the techniques technologies and innovations aiming to push the world towards negative emissions forests weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama cdr doesnt have to utilise complex tech and chemistry the planets natural carbon cycle already removes and stores huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere  primarily through trees the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global humangenerated co 2 emissions over the last few decades regenerating depleted forests reforestation planting new forests afforestation and protecting and helping existing forests thrive through active management can all contribute to offsetting emissions the ipcc report estimates that reforestations and afforestation could potentially capture 05 and 36 billion tonnes of co 2 a year at a cost of usd5 to 50 390 to 39 per metric tonne there are potential drawbacks of extensive afforestation it could compete with food crops as well as reducing the reflection of heat and light back into space that arid lands currently offer to prevent global warming bioenergy with carbon capture and storage europes first beccs pilot project at drax power station biomass on its own is an important fuel source in lowering emissions from industries such as power generation on one hand its created by organic material which during its lifetime absorbs carbon from the atmosphere often enough to offset emissions from transportation and combustion on another it creates a sustainable market for forestry products encouraging landowners to responsibly manage forests which in turn can lead to growing forests and increased co 2 absorption but when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs or ccus technology it becomes a negative carbon emissions process known as beccs drax is partnering with carbon capture company ccapture in a 400000 pilot to develop ccs technology which will remove a tonne of carbon from its operations a day combined with the carbon removed by the forests supplying the biomass it could turn drax into the worlds first negative emissions power station  beyond just storing the captured carbon underground however it can be used to create a range of products  locking in and making use of the carbon for much longer the ipcc report estimates between 05 and 5 billion metric tonnes of carbon could be captured globally this way at a cost of 100 to 200 80160 per metric tonne increased blue carbon mangrove roots its not only forests of fastgrowing pines or eucalyptus that remove co 2 from the atmosphere in fact coastal vegetation such as mangroves salt marshes and sea grasses suck in and store carbon in soil at a greater rate than plants on land  the carbon stored in these waterside ecosystems is known as blue carbon human encroachment and development on coastlines has depleted these environments however efforts are underway to regenerate and expand these hyperabsorbent ecosystems turning them into carbon sinks that can remove more emissions from the atmosphere than conventional forests apple is currently throwing its financial weight behind a mangrove expansion project in colombia to try and offset its global operations boosting ocean plants productivity beyond costal mangroves the ocean is full of plants that use co 2 to photosynthesise  in fact the oceans are thought to be one of the worlds largest carbon sinks but there are some people who think we could enhance marine plants absorption abilities eelgrass bed one such approach involves injecting iron nutrients into the ocean to prompt a bloom in microscopic plants called phytoplankton which float in the upper part of the ocean absorbing the co 2 absorbed from the atmosphere when the plants eventually die they then sink trapping the absorbed carbon on the seabed an additional positive effect would be an increase in dimethyl sulphide which marine plants emit this could alter the reflectivity of clouds that absorb water from the ocean and further act to cool the earth enhanced rock weathering plants absorbing co 2 through photosynthesis is the mostcommonly known part of the carbon cycle however rocks also absorb co 2 as they weather and erode the co 2 usually reaches the rock in the form of rain which absorbs co 2 from the atmosphere as it falls it then reacts with the rocks very slowly breaking them down and forming a bicarbonate that is eventually washed into the ocean locking the carbon on the seabed the problem is it takes a long time one idea that seeks to use this natural process more effectively is to speed it up by pulverising rocks and spreading the resulting powder over a larger area to absorb more co 2 from rain and air natural rock weathering currently absorbs around 03 of global fossil fuel emissions annually but the ipcc estimates at scale it could capture 2 and 4 billion metric tons at a cost of between 50 and 200 39160 per metric ton this approach also requires extensive land use and has not been trialled at scale sequestering carbon in soil soil is another major carbon sink plants and grasses that die and rot store carbon in the soil for long periods however modern farming techniques such as intensive ploughing and fertilisation causes carbon to be released and oxidised to form co 2  adjustments in farming methods could change this and at scale make agriculture carbon neutral  straightforward techniques such as minimising soil disturbance crop rotation and grassland regeneration could sequester as much as 5 billion tonnes of carbon into the soil annually according to the ipcc at potential zero cost a challenge to this method is that once soil is saturated it cant hold any more carbon that material would also be easily released if methods are not maintained in the future increasing soil carbon with biochar a way to supercharge how much carbon soil can store is to add a substance called biochar to the earth a type of charcoal made by burning biomass  such as wood or farm waste in the absence of oxygen biochar can increase the amount of carbon locked into the soil for hundreds or thousands of years it also helps soil retain water and reduce methane and nitrogen emissions biochar has only been trialled at a small scale but the ipcc estimates that between 05 and 2 billion metric tonnes could be captured annually through this means however it predicts a cost of between 30 and 120 2394 per metric tonne additionally producing biochar at scale would require large amounts of biomass that must be sustainably sourced direct air capture co 2 is in the air all around us and so removing it from the atmosphere can effectively take place anywhere direct air capture dac or daccs proposes that the carbon capture and storage technology many power stations are now trialling can be carried out almost anywhere direct air capture of co2 by a climaworks startup kezo involving garbage incineration in switzerland swiss startup climeworks is one company attempting to make dac viable  its technology works by passing air through a surface that reacts with co 2 to form a compound but releases the remaining air the newly formed compound is then heated so the reactive chemical agent can be separated and reused the co 2 is then stored underground with gas and water where it reacts with basalt and turns to stone in less than two years the main challenge for this technique is the cost  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne  and that it requires large amounts of energy creating further demand for electricity one hundred million tonnes wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the primary challenge for negative emission

gardiner a price worth paying why the treasury should maintain a higher carbon price 25 october 2018 power generation last week it was green gb week  a nationwide campaign supported by the uk government showcasing the countrys green credentials and progress in transitioning towards a low carbon world it is therefore timely that ahead of the autumn budget the energy industry should be speaking about measures such as the carbon price support mechanism which are within the power of government to help keep great britain on track in meeting its decarbonisation goals aurora energy research a leading energy research and analytics firm has produced fresh analysis that suggests that maintaining a higher carbon price is key to phasing out coal power generation and decarbonising the uk electricity sector in a timely costeffective manner  is the carbon price at risk in april 2013 hm treasury introduced the carbon price support  a tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain in part this was a response to low costs in the european emissions trading system which requires generators to buy certificates against their emissions at the time the uk government felt that these certificates were too cheap and wanted to impose a higher carbon price to drive a more modern lowcarbon energy mix this carbon price support has had a huge impact particularly on coal prior to its introduction coal represented 50 of power generation but since it has fallen to record lows 2017 saw the first day without any coal on the power system since the industrial revolution records continue to be broken throughout 2018 with coal generation falling to 1 during summer months  however 2018 has also seen prices within the emissions trading system surge prices started this year at 8tonne and now seem to be steadying at roughly 20tonne this has created uncertainty over the future of the uk carbon price support scheme many in energy from power generators to environmental campaign groups are worried that the treasury might respond to rising european prices by slashing the carbon price support in this years autumn budget which could threaten to undo the success the uk has had in decarbonising its energy mix the carbon price is needed to keep coal at bay aurora has tested the impacts of different trajectories for the carbon price going forward to 2040 and the implications are significant particularly for coal auroras analysis shows that if government maintains the current carbon price support rate of 18tonne then at current eu ets futures levels coal should come off the gb power system in 202122 by contrast the same analysis suggests that if chancellor philip hammond were to reduce the carbon price support to 7tonne then coal power stations would stay on the system until 2025 and increase generation during that time as illustrated below source aurora energy research this would make it difficult for the uk to meet its carbon targets  the uk government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with 5yearly carbon budgets cutting the carbon price support rate to 7tonne would result in 29 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide co 2  during the 4 th carbon budget period which runs from 202327 this is an increase of almost 20 on total power sector emissions  against a carbon budget that the uk is currently on track to miss  the cost of the carbon price a higher carbon price raises electricity prices slightly but the mechanics of this are complex and the rising price of electricity is somewhat offset by lower subsidy payments to low carbon generators comparing a status quo scenario to one where the carbon price support falls to 7tonne raises annual power system costs by 700 million average over 202140 which translates to roughly 9 a year on the average households electricity bill source aurora energy research decarbonisation affects not just the future of gbs power system but also its international reputation and progress in meeting climate change targets  the carbon price support has helped to make gbs power system a success story in reducing carbon emissions while keeping costs reasonable there are always
