power station going off grid the companies generating their own energy some of the worlds biggest businesses are going off grid 11 january 2018 power generation the residents of cupertino california are getting used to their new spaceaged neighbour in this silicon valley city a sleek doughnutshaped flying saucer sits on a hillside overlooking the population but this is no extraterrestrial this is the new home of cupertinos mostfamous inhabitant apple the socalled apple campus 2 spaceship has caused a stir since it opened this year with its abundance of trees 100000 squarefoot wellness centre revolutionary chairs and specially designed pizza boxes  it aims to be as the late steve jobs declared it the best office building in the world but theres also something interesting going on outside the building where women and men think up the next iphone around the 175acre campus sits 805000 squarefeet of solar arrays the 17 megawatts mw of solar panels on the spaceships roof and 4 mw of fuel cell storage will provide 75 of the buildings daytime electricity with the rest coming from a nearby 130 mw solar farm the aim is to not only power operations with renewable energy but to do so with selfgenerated renewable energy  and apple arent alone in this endeavour driven by a need to operate more cleanly and enabled by increasingly accessible renewable energy technologies many companies are now pursuing their own energy independence could we soon see the first entirely offgrid multinational going off grid think of ikea and you might think of long afternoons wrestling woodwork and allen keys  what you dont think of is wind turbines however the swedish retailer which boasts 355 locations across 29 countries recently saw the number of wind turbines it owns exceed the number of stores  by 2020 it aims to generate more renewable energy than it uses worldwide  something its already achieved in the nordics and canada  ikea isnt the only retailer exploring innovative energy models us shopping and leisure mall giants target and walmart which count almost 7000 locations between them are also looking to selfgenerate renewable energy at mass scale making use of the space available at their massive stores the retailers are looking to rooftop solar systems to power their efforts to reach 100 renewable energy at the end of last year target was the us leading corporate solar installer with 1475 mw of capacity  followed by walmart with 145 mw unsurprisingly the tech industry is making a big push towards selfsupply or sourcing power from 100 renewable generators this is largely down to just how much electricity they use particularly when it comes to things like data centres estimated by some to become the largest users of electrical power on the planet by the 2020s datacentres house hundreds of rows of servers that remotely store and process internet and mobile data from around the world they are the physical footprint of our digital cloud computing age and already theyre estimated to use roughly 3 of the global electricity supply  one big user of datacentres  crypto currency blockchain  is projected by 2020 to use about the same amount of power each year as denmark  microsoft has tackled its datacentre demand by both developing inhouse generation capabilities and by partnering with local utilities suppliers to source renewable energy for their centres not only does this make operations cleaner but the independence can also increase the reliability of their power supplies which are often backed up by batteries  there are other obvious benefits for companies going energyindependent  one being the pr boost but there is also a significant bottom line benefit even for partly selfgenerating organisations in the first half of 2017 thames water cut 12 million from its annual energy bills by producing 23 of its own electricity while solar and wind made up part of this the water management company generated much of the 146 gwh it produced through biogas made from its own sewage management facilities the power it didnt generate itself was sourced from haven power in the form of renewable biomass electricity what it means for the grid the cynical view may be one that says energy independence is a further step towards entirely independent and unregulated multinationals but there are signs it can benefit the wider population too some selfgeneration operations can feed electricity back into the grid serving as a backup resource at times of high demand this idea of prosuming both producing and consuming electricity is growing outside of big businesses in the residential space  with the rise of electric vehicles and their potential to store and feed power back to the grid it is one likely to grow even further and big companies are taking note microsoft points to its cheyenne wyomingbased data centre as an example of this local utility black hills energy which it has partnered with to source renewable power has the ability to draw from the datacentres normally dormant backup generators in times of need in the uk this is happening on a smaller scale hamerton zoo park in cambridgeshire generates its own onsite wind solar and biomass power making it the most environmentally friendly zoo in europe  excess power not used on site is then sold back to the grid through opus energy  generating extra revenue for the zoo and contributing to overall grid supply even with growing numbers of prosuming and energyindependent companies however there will still be a need for gridstabilising services provided by large scale generators companies perform well when they focus on their core business partnering with energy suppliers to help them manage their electricity  including their selfgenerated power  can make sense but what increasing levels of distributed renewable energy generation offers is the potential to reduce usage of fossil fuels at a countrywide level coordinating the give and take of this energy across the entire system will take significant effort but smart technologies and improving storage will help grids and energyindependent companies work together to make the whole system cleaner share most read
