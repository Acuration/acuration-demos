taiwanese ambassador visit to drax 8 april 2019 the taiwanese ambassador to the uk has visited the countrys largest power station to find out more about how it has transformed itself to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe the visit was organised by nigel adams mp who was keen to demonstrate draxs innovative focus on renewable energy ambassador david yl lin of the taipei representative office visited drax power station in selby north yorkshire to meet with drax power ceo andy koss and mp for selby and ainsty nigel adams mp who explained how drax which was once the uks largest coalfired power station and now produces enough renewable electricity to power four million homes he and the delegation had a tour of the power station and learned how drax upgraded four of its six generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the uks biggest single site renewable power generator in 2018 drax signed up to the governments powering past coal alliance a ukcanadian initiative which seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries as part of efforts to tackle climate change andy koss drax power ceo said we know that coal does not have a role to play in a low carbon future by upgrading two thirds of the power station to run on sustainable biomass were delivering carbon savings of more than 80 compared to coal we want to share some of the engineering knowledge gained from successfully upgrading the power station to use biomass in the hope we can remove more coal from the system globally he added were committed to reducing carbon emissions further and are piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs technology which could enable drax to become the worlds first carbon negative power station nigel adams mp for selby and aintsy said drax is a key economic asset both in selby and the wider region it is vital to the local community directly employing 900 people supporting 5700 jobs through its supply chains and generating 600m a year for the northern economy it is looking to the future both in terms of supporting education and skills through community outreach work as well as exploring opportunities to use new technologies which will enable the power station to innovate and grow drax is progressing plans for repowering its two remaining coal units with high efficiency gas power generation and battery storage it welcomed more than 12500 visitors to the power station last year as a member of the powering past coal alliance drax is committed to the development of a low carbon future globally
