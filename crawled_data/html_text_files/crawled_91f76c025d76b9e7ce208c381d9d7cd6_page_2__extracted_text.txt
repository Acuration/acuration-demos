transport how to get more evs on the roads 25 january 2019 electrification from school runs to goods deliveries getting from a to b is crucial to life in modern britain however a progress report by the committee on climate change ccc found that in 2017 transport was the largest greenhouse gas ghgemitting sector in the uk accounting for 28 of total emissions within domestic transport cars  vans and hgvs are the three most significant sources of emissions accounting for 87 of the sectors emissions a zero carbon future relies on a major shift away from petrol and diesel engines to electric transport a recent report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax examines the decarbonisation efforts of 25 major countries the report found the uk ranked sixth in sales of new electric vehicles evs in the 12 months to september 2018 and seventh for the number of charging points available the governments road to zero strategy outlines the countrys target for as many as 70 of new car sales to be ultralow emission by 2030 alongside up to 40 of new vans it has however been criticised by the committee on climate change as not being ambitious enough  a committee of mps has suggested 2032 becomes the official target date for banning new petrol and diesel cars  rather than 2040 called for in the strategy even as the range of evs on the market grows getting more lowemission vehicles on roads will require incentives and infrastructure improvements heres how some of the countries leading the shift to electrified transport are driving adoption expanding charging infrastructure one of major barriers to ev adoption is a lack of public charging facilitates coupled with reliability issues across a network that includes both old hardware and a plethora of apps and different connections  no one wants to set off on a long journey unsure of whether theyll be able to find a recharging point before their battery goes flat according to the energy revolution report there is one charger for every 5000 people in the uk compared to one for every 500 people in norway the leading country for charging points the scandinavian countrys government has invested heavily in its policy of placing two fast charging stations for every 50 km of main road covering 100 of the cost of installation government support has also been crucial in second and third ranked countries the netherlands and sweden respectively the dutch living lab smart charging is a collaboration between government and private organisations to use wind and solar to change vehicles while sweden has combined its klimatklivet investment scheme for both public and private charge points with experiments such as charging roads  china where half of the worlds 300000 charge points are located has issued a directive calling for the construction of 48 million electric charging points around the country by 2020  its also assisting private investments to make charging stations more financially viable the uks road to zero strategy is to expand charging infrastructure through a 400 million joint investment fund with private investors draxs energising britain report found the uk is on track to meet its 2030 target of 28000 installed chargers ahead of time however deployment still clusters around london the south east and scotland more direct government incentives or policies may be needed to balance this disparity and in the uk the scottish government is leading the pack with a 2032 ban on new petrol and diesel cars plus a range of initiatives including public charging networks and the switched on towns and city fund  charging points are necessary for electrified roads however its a chickenandegg situation more chargers dont mean more evs getting more evs on roads also requires financial incentive money makes the wheels go around putting infrastructure in place is one thing but the reality is evs are expensive especially new ones and cold hard cash is an important driver of adoption financial incentives have been a part of norways policies since the 1980s with the countrys high fuel prices  compared to the us for example further helping to make evs attractive current benefits for ev owners include no import or purchase taxes no vat no road tax no road tolls half price on ferries and free municipal parking there are also nonfinancial incentives such as buslane usage sweden the second ranked country for new ev sales in 2018 is a similar case where high fuel prices are combined with a carrotandstick approach of subsidies for evs and rising road taxes for fossil fuelpowered vehicles including hybrids the uk has had a grant scheme in place since 2011 but last year removed hybrid vehicles from eligibility and dropped the maximum grant for new ev buyers from 4500 to 3500  evs are also exempt from road taxes in april 2019 transport for london is implementing a low emissions zone ulez which exempts evs from a daily charge subsidies for both buyers and vehicle manufacturers have been a cornerstone of chinas policies with support coming up to around 15000 per vehicle  chinese ev buyers can also skip the lottery system for new license plates the country has in place to reduce congestion heavy subsidies have allowed the country to claim as much as 50 of the entire ev passenger market however it makes change expensive and the government is now preparing to find a more sustainable way of driving adoption preparing for transport beyond subsidies china isnt afraid to strongarm manufacturers into building more evs companies with annual sales of more than 30000 vehicles are required to meet a quota of at least 10 evs or hybrids  however the government has begun to scale back subsidies in the hope it will drive innovation in areas such as batteries robotics and automation which will in turn reduce the price for end consumers norway which owes so much of its decarbonisation leadership in lowcarbon transport to subsidies is also grappling with how to move away from this model as evs creep increasingly towards the norm the taxes lost through evs exclusions become more economically noticeable while the government says the subsidies will remain in place until at least 2020 different political parties are calling to make the market commercially viable  there is also concern the schemes only pass on savings to those who can afford new ev models  rather than the wider population who face higher taxes for being unable to upgrade its not just governments responsibility to make new markets for evs sustainable but for business to innovate within the area too drax group ceo will gardiner recently said his company must help to  ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution  thats a view welcomed by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum concerned not just about mitigating manmade climate change but also to ensure a just transition during the economys decarbonisation energy and clean growth minister claire perry spoke at an aldersgate group event in london in january its been very easy in the past for concerns about the climate to be dismissed as the worries of the few not the many luckily weve been able to strip out a lot of the myths surrounding decarbonisation and costs but we have to be mindful that this is a problem which will have to be solved by the many not just the middle class many countries have set ambitious targets for when the ban of new petrol and diesel vehicles will come into effect government involvement

electrification when youre travelling to another continent there are few things more irritating to forget than a plug adapter thankfully theyre relatively easy to buy even if it means putting holiday plans on hold for half an hour but what if rather than having the wrong plug to charge a phone abroad you found yourself unable to plug in your electric vehicle ev on your own street its a situation that could soon become a reality as different vehicle manufacturers release new models and different energy and charging companies expand their recharging networks not all of which can connect with each other fragmentation among charging networks confusing cables and meeting increased electricity demand are all challenges the uk needs to solve to enable allelectric vehicles and cut transport emissions ev charging at drax power station north yorkshire around the country there are more than 17600 public charge points for evs to power up at  offered by 35 different charging networks while some offer connectors that plug straight into cars others require motorists to use their own cables and connect the ports but similarly to how different models of smartphone often require a different type of charging cable not all evs can plug into to the same chargers or use the same protocol to link their batteries to the charging system its something that without standardisation could lead to fragmentation and become a major pain point for electric vehicle owners as well a barrier to more widespread adoption currently car makers in germany are united in backing a whats known as combined charging system ccs but japanese manufactures support making chademo standing for charge de move the standard protocol which requires a different type of connecting cable to ccs tesla uses its own network supercharger points and although its cars can recharge at other charge points if the driver has their adapter with them other manufacturers vehicles cant yet recharge at tesla superchargers tesla model s and supercharger then theres china the worlds largest market where 200 million evs are expected to be on the roads by 2040  uses an entirely different gbt system keen to avoid missing out on such a lucrative market tesla has added a bgt charging port to its model x vehicles  currently europe uses the same charging infrastructure as the uk and the larger charging networks operate the same service across the continent as is the case when setting out on a long drive anywhere though its worth checking where charge points are before setting off it may be confusing but its still relatively early days for the ev charging industry and like vhs vs betamax there could yet be consolidation across the global market slow fast rapid expanding where drivers can recharge is key to bringing more evs onto roads and in efforts to help grow this the government has put forward a proposal that all new homes business and street lights should offer charging points  however all points do not charge equally and are divided into slow fast and rapid home charging will be an important part of ev infrastructure with overnight charging seen as key to managing the increased electricity demand created by substantial ev adoption it is however the slowest and can take six to 12 hours to fully recharge a vehicle fast chargers are those normally found on streets or public destinations like car parks for people unable to run a cable from their home to their ev these will be crucially important however they typically require drivers to bring their own connection cable to hook up and can take between two and five hours to fully recharge depending on the vehicles by far the fastest method of ev charging is through rapid charging which is mostcommonly found at motorway service stations these charge points provide connectors for drivers to plug in and can recharge an ev to 80 in just 30 minutes connector fragmentation however could cause some issues at these sites the likely solution  for the time being  is offering multiple different options such as at shells recharge points  which house both rapid ccs and chademo connections similarly to how traditional pumps might offer both petrol and diesel a london fire brigade bmw i3 charging more and smarter charging as the uk heads towards the 2040 deadline for the end of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales having the necessary infrastructure to support ev adoption is a key issue to address according to pwc major companies are making inroads towards addressing this need with oil giant bp acquiring chargemaster the countrys largest charging network in june the government is also encouraging further growth through a 400 million fund to be allocated to companies building charging infrastructure  in addition to allowing more evs to recharge smartgrid technology will play an important role in managing how so many are charged without causing surges in demand or tripping out home or business premises circuits this can also offer opportunities such as vehicletogrid storage  that enable the national grid to treat connected evs like batteries at times of stress electric vehicles are still beginning to appear en mass in the uk however their potential to reduce transport emissions makes them an important investment for the government vehicle manufacturers and energy companies building charging networks spreading an understanding of how to charge evs will help drive returns on those investments tags transport  electric vehicles evs drax a rail history 5 july 2018 power generation railways in great britain today are often seen as unreliable or chaotic yet they remain a vital part of the lives of the population and the economy of the country when rail transport first arrived in earnest in the 19 th century it suddenly allowed goods from around the world as well as people to quickly cross the country it reshaped perceptions of the countrys geography unlocked the population and accelerated industries over time however the role of the railways has diminished owing largely to the massive rise in car ownership and the shifting of freight onto the road but that is not to say it has completely lost its importance with 6000 trains passing through drax power station every year rail is still integral to drax and the region around it in fact since the very first introduction of the railways to the region it has played a major part in shaping the landscape a village with two stations before the construction of the power station or nationalisation of the railways drax village was wellconnected with two different railway lines running through it the north eastern railway ner selby to goole line and the hull and barnsley railways doncaster to hull line each of these lines ran through a different station with ner calling at drax hales station while hull and barnsley called at drax abbey station but following nationalisation and british rails modernisation plans drax abbey station which had closed to passengers in 1931 closed to goods traffic in 1959 drax hales station followed suit in 1964 when it was closed as part of what became known as the beeching axe british rail chairman richard beeching famously carried out a review of britains railways in the 60s and as a result closed vast quantities of  what he considered  uneconomical lines explains andrew christian fgd  byproducts section head at drax power station and expert on the areas history at that time oil was cheap people were increasingly using cars and motorways were being constructed nobody really foresaw the rail demand that would be needed in the future to serve the power station daleks on a merrygoround in the 1960s and 70s with the planning and construction of drax power station underway there was a new need for railways in bringing coal from the new selby coalfield this resulted in the reopening of a closed part of the hull and barnsley line for four miles from a reinstated junction at hensall known as hensall junction it was renamed drax power station branch junction and later shorted to drax branch junction a rail system known as a mgr loop was installed on the power station grounds which allows trains to loop around the station and deposit coal  today also wood pellets  without stopping the merrygoround trains as they are known were originally made up of 40 fourwheeled merrygoround mgr hopper wagons these were much smaller than the wagons that carry biomass from ports to power stations today and more than 11000 mgrs where built to serve coal power stations around great britain photo by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power station the opentopped wagons were each capable of carrying 33 tonnes of pulverised coal which was automatically released thanks to a piece of machinery alongside the track colloquially known as daleks thanks to their resemblance to the dr who villain but as the power station began to change and evolved to fit the modern world so too did the railway serving it rail at drax beyond coal  the original drax rail loop was a single track with three coal unloading points by 1993 there was 145 km of track with 27 sets of points and crossings allowing trains to switch rails thanks to the double tracked loop and extra tracks laid to serve traffic taking limestone in and gypsum out from the power station this was further expanded with the introduction of biomass and a new double track and unloading facility in 2013 the biomass trains are specially designed to keep compressed wood pellets dry and they are much longer than their mgr predecessors at 182 meters long their capacity is 30 greater than a coal wagon it means the 23wagon trains bringing biomass to the power stations from tyne hull immingham and liverpools ports are a quarter of a mile long it might be a far cry from the heyday in which the railways crisscrossed the region but they remain a vital part of the area and while the areas original lines are now 50 years dormant their remnants are still visible in the lasting impact theyve left on the surrounding landscape many of the embankments and bridges found in and around drax stem from those first railway lines while much of the a645 road that was constructed in the early 1990s runs along the track bed of ners route to goole photos by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power stati on the trains might not stop in drax village anymore but they remain a vital part of the landscape and how its powered northern powerhouse minister jake berry was in yorkshire on 5 july 2018 to unveil the first drax freight wagons with northern powerhouse branding to deliver biomass to the power station read more tags supply chain  drax power station  history  railways and trains  transport the electric transport revolution 16 april 2018 electrification with rapid technological improvements and falls in battery prices improving performance and reducing the cost experts predict that by 2050 90 of newbuild cars will be powered by electricity  however its not only roads where transport is decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50 should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels although the deal fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the european union to environmental ngos the imo did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out co 2 emissions entirely as paris agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom businesses around the world are innovating small fleets of batterypowered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in norway belgium and the netherlands are preparing to set sail  including some able to run autonomously without a crew  dutch company portliner is also gearing up to launch the first fullyelectric emissionfree barges in europe dubbed tesla ships portliner chief executive officer ton van meegen claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbonneutral batteries  the first six barges alone are expected to remove 23000 trucks from the roads annually in the netherlands replacing them with zeroemission methods of transport china also recently launched an electric cargo ship to haul coal which whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 25 of global greenhouse emissions that result from the

june 2017 sustainable bioenergy a truck arrives at an industrial facility deep in the expanding forestland of the southeastern usa it passes through a set of gates over a massive scale then onto a metal platform the driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console slowly the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises as it does the trucks cargo empties into a large container behind it two minutes later its empty this is how you unload a wood fuel truck at drax biomass compressed wood pellet plants in louisiana and mississippi  what is a tipper some people call them truck dumpers but it depends on who you talk to says jim stemple senior director of procurement at drax biomass we just call it the tipper regardless of what its called what the tipper does is easy to explain it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently the sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the atlantic however at industrial facilities in the united states its more common tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn grain and gravel stemple explains basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping both of drax biomass two operational pellet facilities a third is currently idle while being upgraded use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark  known in the forestry industry as hog fuel which is used to heat the plants wood chip dryers  sawdust and raw wood chips which are used to make the compressed wood pellets  how does it work the tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other to ensure safety each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end where the load is emptying from so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long once tipped far enough each platform tips to a roughly 60degree angle the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for one way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles  which then goes through the pelleting process of the hammer mills the dryer and the pellet mill says stemple the other way takes it to the fuel pile which goes to the furnace the furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 115 and 12 before they go through the pelleting process if everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour says stemple from full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load efficiency benefits using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach but its also an efficient one firstly theres the speed it allows multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour and because cargo is delivered straight into the system theres no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system secondly for the truck owners the benefits are they dont need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks instead its just the tipper  one piece of equipment  which is maintained to keep operations on track however there is one thing drivers need to be wary of what they leave in their driver cabins open coffee cups food containers  anything not firmly secured  all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play i guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once stemple says the first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time tags investors  biomass energy  technology  wood pellets  transport power and the rise of electric cars 12 december 2016 electrification all great technological innovations need infrastructure to match the world didnt change from candles to lightbulbs overnight  power stations had to be built electricity cables rolled out and buildings fitted with wiring the same is true of electric vehicles ev think of the number of petrol stations lining the uk roads if evs continue their rise in popularity the country will need electric carcharging facilities to augment and then replace these petrol stations this could mean big extensions of electricity grid infrastructure both in the building of new power generation capacity to meet demand and in the extension of the networks themselves in short it could mean a significant change in how electricity is used and supplied the need for better electricity infrastructure in 2013 only 3500 of newly registered cars in the uk were plugin electric or hybrid evs in 2016 that number jumped to 63000 their use is rising rapidly but the lack of infrastructure has kept a cap on the number of evs on uk roads that is starting to change as of 2019 all new and refurbished houses in the eu will have to be fitted with an electric car charging point  according to a draft directive announced by brussels the uk will probably no longer be an eu member by the time the directive comes into effect but nevertheless the uk government is pursuing its own ways to account for the rise of evs it has pledged more than 600 million between 2015 and 2020 to support ultralowemission vehicles  38 million of this has already been earmarked for public charging points there are more innovative responses to ev rise too nissan in partnership with italian energy provider enel has announced it will install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk with their innovative v2g technology  cars plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary so when there is a peak in demand the grid could access the cars stored energy to help meet it the total capacity of the 18000 nissan electric vehicles currently operational on uk roads comes to around 180 mw so even today  before electric vehicles have really taken off  this could give the national grid an additional supply roughly the size of a small power station peaks in electricity demand however tend to occur in the late afternoon or evening as it gets dark and more lighting and heating gets switched on this also happens to be rush hour so under this scheme the time of day the cars are most likely to be on the roads is also when itd be most helpful to have them plugged in this could lead to financial incentives for people to give up the flexibility of driving their cars only when they need to more electric cars more demand for electricity more pollution more evs on the road makes sound environmental sense  they enable a 40 reduction in co2 emissions  but ultimately the energy still has to come from somewhere that means more power stations the scale of this new demand shouldnt be underestimated if european drivers were to go 80 electric some studies have suggested it would require 150 gw of additional ondemand capacity  the equivalent of 40 draxsized power stations but if evs are to live up to their green potential that additional power needs to come from innovations in storage such as in the nissan example and from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass fossil fuels would ideally be used only to plug any gaps that intermittency creates  for example by briefly firing up the small gas power stations drax plans to build in england and wales what does this mean for generators drax as operator of the uks largest biomass power station and with plans for new rapid response open cycle gas turbines ocgts is well placed to be at the forefront of providing reliable affordable power in the event of a widespread rollout of electric vehicles the ocgts in particular are designed for use in peak times which in the future could be when the nations electric vehicles are plugged in overnight  today this is when electricity demand is at its lowest a future of more electric cars is a positive one theyre cleaner

transported to the power station in the most energyefficient way possible and while many jobs in the north of england are being lost with the planned closure of a number of older coalfired power stations we continue to employ over a thousand people directly here in north yorkshire in fact its no exaggeration to say that drax is a genuine northern powerhouse to borrow a phrase from the chancellor of the exchequer which is why we hope he and his colleagues in government will listen when we say that were seriously concerned that the planned auctions for new green energy could result in bill payers missing out on savings of over 2 billion the government has committed to three further renewable energy auctions that will happen over the next few years the first of them is already planned for later in 2016 as far as we know those auctions will only be open to offshore wind and perhaps also something being referred to as less established technologies but independent research published by nera and imperial college london suggests that a single technology approach could waste a significant amount of money the research was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main renewable energy technologies  wind solar and biomass as a result economists conclude that hard working families and businesses could enjoy significant savings if these auctions were opened up to include other renewables but the sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow this makes wind and solar intermittent energy technologies backup power is needed when the weathers not right or when demand is high naturally this standby energy isnt free someone has to pay for it but those additional costs are not currently included in the way that the government calculates how much support the different kinds of renewable energy require and the iclnera research shows that when the true costs are added in offshore wind is actually the most expensive form of renewable energy the affordable solution is to convert existing power stations to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal  this balanced approach also allows more offshore wind and solar onto our electricity network without the need for more fossil fuels to provide overall reliability more biomass conversions can also help the uk end coal by energy secretary amber rudds 2025 target date  thats what we mean when we say drax needs the right support to finish the job were asking the government to consider the true cost of bringing new renewable capacity on stream and then to add sustainable biomass to the auctions for new contracts that decision could save bill payers up to 2bn  it could safeguard thousands of direct and indirect jobs in yorkshire and the north of england and it will give our country the reliable renewable power we need when others just cant deliver it tags biomass energy  ships and shipping  transport  decarbonisation  1 2 name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up
