power station tag flexibility and stability and power system security the role of biomass in securing reliable power generation 5 december 2022 power generation  sustainable bioenergy key takeaways since 2021 there has been a sharp rise in the price of electricity driven by a steep increase in wholesale gas prices in europe in particular a number of factors including the impact of covid19 and the effects of the war in ukraine have contributed to driving gas prices to record highs the volatility of gas prices means the uk needs to find replacements for the role of gas in helping to balance the electricity grid biomass and pumped storage hydro have the capacity to provide reliable renewable energy to uk homes and businesses while contributing to keeping the grid stable great britain and many other parts of the world are in a phase of energy uncertainty since 2021 soaring power prices have caused energy bills to escalate as much as fivefold and led to a string of collapses of uk energy suppliers as of october 2022 the annual energy bill for a uk household with typical energy consumption has been capped at 2500 a year  96 higher than the winter 202122 price cap  the upper limits the rates suppliers can charge for their default tariffs the costs of energy to end consumers would be even higher were it not for this energy price guarantee introduced by the uk government on 1 october and currently due to be in place until 31 march 2023 in germany the government has committed 200 billion towards a defensive shield against surging energy prices while france has capped energy price increases at 4 for 2022 and 15 from january 2023  the primary factor in this change is the rise in natural gas prices periods of turbulence driven by commodity prices emphasises the need for a diverse secure supply of power generation available to the uk grid as the energy system works through the necessary transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources the need for a reliable lowcarbon affordable power becomes even greater whats driving up gas prices as the world went into lockdown in 2020 the demand for energy including gas dropped  and so did supply when countries began to emerge from lockdown in 2021 and economies started to reboot supply struggled to keep up with renewed demand triggering a rise in the price of wholesale gas and other fuels the cold winter in 20202021 and unusually hot summers in 2021 and 2022 also dented european gas storage levels further contributing to rising gas prices an already uncertain energy market was further destabilised by russias invasion of ukraine this was particularly true in europe most notably germany where russian gas at the time accounted for around 40 of total gas consumption  gas prices began increase rapidly as a result of factors including fears that russia would restrict the supply of gas to europe in response to sanctions against the country or that an embargo on russian gas would be introduced constrained gas supplies also increased global demand for alternative sources like liquified natural gas lng imports which account for about 22 of the uks gas this increase in demand has pushed up the price of these alternatives forcing countries to compete to attract supplies there are several reasons why higher gas prices have such a significant impact on uk energy prices firstly a considerable proportion of uk electricity comes from gas in the second quarter of 2022 gas represented 42 of the uk energy mix  making it the countrys single largest source of electricity the uk also relies heavily on gas to heat its homes and with those homes being some of the oldest and least energyefficient in europe it takes more gas to heat them up and keep them warm click to viewdownload the role of biomass and pumped storage hydro in ensuring security of supply in addition to the pressures placed on gas and electricity supplies since 2021 the uks journey to net zero depends on increasing reliance on intermittent sources of power such as wind and solar as such there is a renewed need to ensure a diverse range of power generation sources to secure electricity supply globally as gas becomes less economical biomass offers a renewable reliable dispatchable source of power that can balance the grid and supply baseload power regardless of weather conditions the turbine hall at cruachan power station our four 645 mw biomassfuelled generating turbines at drax power station make it the largest single renewable source of power in the uk the plant can produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of five million homes come rain or shine draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in the scottish highlands also offers national grid the capacity to store 440 mw of renewable power by absorbing excess electricity from zero carbon sources like wind and solar cruachan can store and deploy power when the grid needs it most the ability of pumped storage hydro and biomass plants to store energy and quickly adjust output as required will become ever more important as the uks use of renewables grows and there are fewer spinning turbines connected to the grid as renewable nonintermittent sources of electricity biomass and pumped storage hydro are central to a safe economic and stable electricity grid  and to the uks lowcarbon energy future tags biomass energy

generation  will gardiner  flexibility and stability and power system security the cost of staying in control iain staffell imperial college london 31 august 2020 opinion the cost of keeping britains power system stable has soared and now adds 20 onto the cost of generating electricity the actions that national grid takes to manage the power system have typically amounted to 5 of generation costs over the last decade but this share has quadrupled over the last two years in the first half of 2020 the cost of these actions averaged 100 million per month supplying electricity to our homes and workplaces needs more than just power stations generating electricity supply and demand must be kept perfectly in balance  and flows of electricity around the country must be actively managed to keep all the interconnected components stable and prevent blackouts national grids costs for taking these actions have been on the rise as we reported over the previous two summers  but recently they have skyrocketed at the start of the decade balancing added about 1mwh to the cost of electricity but last quarter it surpassed 5mwh for the first time see below balancing prices have risen in step with the share of variable renewables the dashed line below shows that for every extra percent of electricity supplied by wind and solar adds 10 pence per mwh to the balancing price last quarter really bucks this trend though and balancing prices have risen 35 above the level expected from this trend the uk energy research centre predicted that wind and solar would add up to 5mwh to the cost of electricity due to their intermittency  and britain has now reached this point albeit a few years earlier than expected this is partly because keeping the power system stable is requiring more interventions than ever before with low demand and high renewable generation national grid is having to order more wind farms to reduce their output at a cost of around 20 million per month they even had to take out a 50 million contract to reduce the output from the sizewell b nuclear reactor at times of system stress left the quarterlyaverage cost of balancing the power system expressed as a percentage of the cost of generation right balancing price shown against share of variable renewables with dots showing the average over each quarter a second reason for the price rise is that national grids costs of balancing are passed on to generators and consumers who pay per mwh as demand has fallen by a sixth since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic the increased costs are being shared out among a smaller base  ofgem has stepped in to cap the balancing service charges at a maximum of 10mwh until late october their covid support scheme will defer up to 100 million of charges until the following year for a quarter of a century the electricity demand in gb ranged from 19 to 58 gw   historically demand minus the intermittent output of wind and solar farms never fell below 14 gw however in each month from april to june this year this net demand fell below 7 gw just as a mclaren sports car is happier going at 70 than 20 mph the national grid is now being forced to operate well outside its comfort zone this highlights the importance of the work that national grid must do towards their ambition to be ready for a zerocarbon system by 2025 the fact we are hitting these limits now rather than in a few years time is a direct result of covid running the system right at its limits is having a shortterm financial impact and is teaching us lessons for the longterm

electricity  national grid  electric insights what is the national grid 21 august 2020 power generation what is the grid the national grid or simply the grid is the network of powerlines pylons gas lines and interconnectors that makes up great britains electricity and gas systems  and the engineers technology and rules responsible for their seamless operation it ensures electricity generated anywhere by any source can be transmitted to meet the demand for power wherever its needed across the country it heats homes and businesses it helps us to cook our food the national electricity grid consists of a high voltage transmission system which connects electricity from power stations to substations and smaller local networks  called distribution network operators or dnos  which transport electricity into homes and businesses how does it work transporting electricity around the grid is more complicated than just connecting cables to power generators in order to move power around the country things like voltage and frequency of electricity must be balanced and kept uniform at all times without this unstable electricity could damage equipment and ultimately lead to blackouts the national grid electricity system operator eso is a separate entity from the national grid company and is responsible for maintaining the correct voltage frequency and reserve power levels to ensure electricity is transmitted safely and efficiently at all times it does this by working with power generators and energy storage facilities to provide what are known as  ancillary services   a set of processes that keep the power system in operation stable and balanced the national grid is the network of power stations powerlines and electricity infrastructure that allows electricity to be generated transported and used across the country who controls it in great britain the national grid company owns and operates the transmission systems which ensure electricity is delivered safely and reliably across the country the local distribution system is made up of 14 regional dno companies which deliver electricity at a lower voltage from substations to homes and businesses great britains grid incudes england scotland wales and several surrounding islands northern ireland is part of an islandwide electricity system with the republic of ireland national grid fast facts great britains grid is made up of more than 7000 kilometres of cables 90000 pylons 346 substations and 1500 kilometres of underground cables construction of the grid began on 14 july 1928 and was completed on 5 september 1933 it was originally designed to operate as 7 separate connected grids before a group of rebellion engineers attempted to run it as one on 29 october 1938  it has run as one grid ever since a decade ago britain had 80 individual points of generation to manage today there are nearly one million all electricity in great britain operates at a frequency of 50hz  a deviation of just 1 above or below could cause damage how is the grid changing as the sources that generate great britains electricity change to include more renewables  the grid has also changed the grid was built to work with large power stations that operate huge spinning turbines with decarbonisation its evolved to include a greater variety of intermittent weather dependent sources such as wind solar and decentralised power sources that serve individual buildings or communities this makes managing the grids stability more complicated and requires the use of more ancillary services usually delivered by

flexibility and stability and power system security  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  faqs frequently asked questions what are ancillary services power generation what are ancillary services ancillary services are a set of processes that enable the transportation of electricity around the grid while keeping the power system operating in a stable efficient and safe way why do we need ancillary services when electricity makes its way through the country it needs to be managed so that the power generation and electricity useage levels are equal the regulating of elements such as frequency and voltage has to be carefully managed so that the massive amounts of electricity moving  or transmitted  are able to be used safely in homes businesses schools and hospitals around the country ancillary services enable the power system to operate in a stable efficient and safe way what do ancillary services offer ancillary services include a wide variety of electrical efficiency and safety nets all focussed on ensuring the power system delivers enough output to meet demand yet remains stable frequency the uks power system runs at a frequency of 50 hertz  to stay balanced it has to remain at that frequency turbines and generators adjust the speed at which they spin automatically to increase or decrease power in line with demand and ensure that the system is kept stable voltage different parts of the uks transmission system use voltages of either 400 275 or 132 kilovolts to ensure that voltage remains within 5 of those figures at all times  to be safe for domestic electricity use power stations can produce or reabsorb excess energy as reactive power  keeping the overall system reliable inertia turbine use is important in keeping the system operating in its current state even with disruptions and sudden changes the electricity system uses the weight of heavy spinning turbines to create stability  acting as dampeners and smoothing out unexpected changes in frequency across the network reserve an important part of ancillary servicing is making sure that there are no surprises  so holding back power to release if something unexpected happens means that the network can function confidently knowing that there are generators and other power providers such as pumped hydro storage waiting ready to back it up who manages ancillary services in the uk the grids stability is managed by national grid electricity system operator eso  a separate company of national grid electricity transmission et  the eso works with ancillary service providers to either sign longterm contracts or make short term requests for a service these partners are often power stations such as drax power station which have large spinning turbines capable of controlling voltage frequency providing inertia and serving as a source of reserve power what is the future of ancillary services as we move to a more renewable system as the uks electricity system continues to change so to do its requirements for different ancillary services the switch from a few very large power stations to a greater variety of different electricity sources some of which may be dependent on the weather as well as changes in how the country uses electricity means there is a greater need for ancillary services to keep the grid stable these services have historically been delivered by thermal power stations but new innovations are enabling wind turbines to provide inertial response and overcome changes in frequency and batteries to store reserve power that can then be supplied to the power system to ensure balance ancillary services fast facts batteries can in some cases be cheaper ancillary alternatives to conventional sources of energy the hornsdale power reserve which runs on a tesla battery in south australia lowered the price of frequency ancillary services by 90 after just four months of use ancillary services usually work from habit knowing when to slow electricity production or increase supply based around the general publics standard working hours  dinner time and the early morning rush but during the covid19 lockdown  electricity consumption on weekdays fell by 13 and so national grid eso had to intervene with ancillary services to keep the lights on every year the esos ancillary services move 300 terawatt hours twh of electricity which is equal to 4 trillion kettles boiling at once  with recent innovations around renewable energies there are a wider variety of ways for ancillary services to generate power go

investors  decarbonisation  electricity maintaining electricity grid stability during rapid decarbonisation 13 november 2019 power generation great britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the energy system argues torres to build a modern and resilient grid we will need a wider lens
