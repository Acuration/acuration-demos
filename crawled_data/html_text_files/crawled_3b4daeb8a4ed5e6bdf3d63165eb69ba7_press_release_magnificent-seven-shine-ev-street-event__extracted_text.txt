across the country today sunday to drive special electric race cars they built themselves in a spectacular city centre street race 29 april 2019 car designs included a bear and cannon while one school recycled the packaging their car was delivered in to make its bodywork as the pupils and students took part in a range of colourful events from drag races to a 90minute endurance event on a special street circuit in the centre of hull all seven built their cars in the build up to the race thanks to funding from drax group which provided the kits to build the cars and all the necessary tools the 35000 initiative from drax is part of its efforts to inspire more children to study stem science technology engineering and maths subjects and create the skilled workforce of the future that the northern powerhouse needs selby abbey primary schools car the cannon  named after their teacher stacey cannon by the pupils engineers and staff from the power station also joined in spending time with each of the teams to help assemble the cars ahead of todays race organised by the greenpower education trust and sponsored by drax drax power ceo andy koss said the commitment from the schools has been exceptional  its really sparked the students imaginations which is what this project is all about finding fun and exciting projects like this to engage young people and encourage them to study stem subjects is the key to ensuring the next generation of potential employees has the skills that innovative businesses like ours need he added too many children in the north are falling behind their counterparts in other areas of the uk when it comes to education and skills leading to a serious skills shortage for employers we want to change that with initiatives like this one pupils from selby abbey primary school meet lord prescott prior to their race stacey cannon a teacher at selby abbey primary whose pupils named their car the cannon in her honour said im really proud of them all and the effort they have put in to this and im proud to see the car out there with my name on it i think they have grown so much through this especially in relation to the stem subjects weve taught all subjects for the past few weeks by using the car and as a teacher it will hopefully open their minds to the world of engineering ends media contacts mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email

notes to editors four primary schools  barwic parade camblesforth selby community and selby abbey  received a 15mph goblin g2 batterypowered car which students and teachers then assembled older students from selby high school holy family catholic high school and selby college built the more powerful formula 24 car which can reach speeds of up to 30mph both cars took around 15 hours to build with the teams also designing their own bodywork the primary school teams took part in a series of drag and slalom races in their goblin cars the top drivers from each team then raced against each other in a final 1km circuit through the city centre students from the secondary schools and colleges raced the f24 cars around the same circuit in an endurance test the teams had to switch between three drivers and maintain their cars during the race and the winner was the team which completed the most laps in 90 minutes about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power

yorkshire which supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england b2b supply drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich
