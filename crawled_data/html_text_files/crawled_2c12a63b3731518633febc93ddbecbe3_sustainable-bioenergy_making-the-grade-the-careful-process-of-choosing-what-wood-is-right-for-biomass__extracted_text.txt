wood is right for biomass british columbias forests are carefully graded to get the greatest value from each tree 16 december 2022 sustainable bioenergy key takeaways british columbias working forests are owned by the province and managed to preserve the environment while supporting forestry industries and local communities when forests are harvested professional licensed scalers who are independent of logging companies or sawmills evaluate the size and quality of wood the processes and assessments made by scalers are extensive and designed to ensure high quality lumber makes its way to commercial markets the careful process of grading wood ensures that only lowquality wood unusable by lumber sectors is used to produce sustainable biomass pellets healthy working forests are full of different species of trees that serve as essential commercial resource to rural communities within these forests are different qualities of wood and trees the lumber industry which drives the commercial forestry in british columbia only uses highquality sawlogs that can be processed into lumber and other valuable solid wood products when forest companies and the provincial government identify areas of forest suitable for management the materials are professionally independently sorted and selected by the logging operator according to specifications set by the sawmill and by merchantability specifications set by government this leaves a range of rejected roundwood trees and other materials that are unsuitable for lumber characteristics of rejected material can include undersized logs rotting in parts excessive twisting cracks large knots or exposure to damage like fires but thats not to say the wood isnt valuable the biomass industry emerged as a way to utilise wood and residues from forestry and sawmill processes to sort through wood harvests and identify what wood is suitable for lumber forest companies in british columbia use a grading system the provinces forest act outlines that timber harvested from publicly owned crown must be scaled measured and graded this standardised system means all types of wood are utilised and the full value of a harvest maximised for lumber and other wood products  ensuring forests remain valuable resources that are replanted and managed for future generations making the grade the policy of scaling and grading timber has been in action along british columbias coastal forests since as long ago as 1902 and while log grades have evolved and expanded with changes in wood utilisation and forest practices todays grading rules and conventions are very similar to those used more than a century ago timber scaling and grading can only be carried out by trained licenced professionals known as scalers the processes and assessments they are required to carry out are rigorous and extensive  as outlined in a regularly updated scaling manual scalers apply grading rules to determine the logs gross dimensions estimate what portion of the log is available to produce a given product and consider the quality of the product that could be produced from the log its the scalers job to assess the visible characteristics of each log and determine what can be recovered from the log given its size and quality characteristics results in british columbia are reported in cubic metres with one cubic metre of timber viewed as a cubic metre of solid wood known as firmwood free of any rot hole char or missing wood its then up to the manufacturer to get the best and most valuable product out of the available volume grade rules typically include three components minimum or maximum dimensions a requirement that a percentage of the logs volume must be available to manufacture a given product a requirement that a percentage of the product manufactured from the log must meet or exceed a given quality by developing methods of taking measurements in british columbias coastal and interior regions meaningful data is generated to understand the health and quality of the provinces diverse forests click to viewdownload  grade code 1  premium sawlogs the highestquality and most valuable grade a grade code 1 log must be 25 m or more in length and 10 cm or more in radius it can also be a slab of wood 25 m long and 20 cm wide and 20 cm or more in thickness measured at a right angle to the growth rings for species like hemlock cedar or balsam log or slab at least 90 of the overall log can be manufactured into lumber meaning its free of rot chars or holes without too many knots or twists for other species at least 75 can be manufactured into lumber for all species at least 75 of the lumber will be suitable for sale grade code 2  sawlog smaller than premium sawlogs grade code 2 logs are also 25 m or longer but can be only 5 cm wide grade code 2 sawlogs can also be made from slabs of wood 25 m or more in length and 15 cm wide with a 15 cm or more thickness measured at a right angle to the growth rings in species like hemlock or cedar at least 75 of the wood can be manufactured into lumber while for a balsam logs its at least 67 for all other species at least 50 of overall wood can be manufactured into lumber grade code 4  lumber reject lumber reject is the grade given to a log or slab thats higher in grade than firmwood reject but not highgrade enough to meet the requirements for a sawlog due to factors like rot chars and holes the reason there is no grade code 3 or 5 is because they were merged into the lumber reject category as the needs of forestry industries changed grade code 6  undersized log an undersized log is the higher in grade than firmwood reject but cut from a tree which was below the minimum diameter to be processed into highquality useable lumber grade code z  firmwood reject the lowest grade of wood a grade code z log is not of a high enough quality to be made into lumber a log falls into the firmwood reject category if there is heart rot or a hole that runs the entire length of the log and any firmwood around the defect makes up less than 50 of the overall log a scaler may also grade a log as z if rot is in the log and they estimate the net length of the log to be less than 12 m sap rot or charred wood within a log where the residual firmwood is less than 10 cm in diameter at the butt end of the log also makes it grade code z portions of healthier logs that are less than 10 cm in diameter or portion of a slab that is less than 10 cm in thickness are also in this category supporting healthy resilient forests wood that is unsuitable for valuable sawlogs was once seen as a residual of forestry harvest and burned as a means of disposal emitting co 2 and polluting local air the biomass market however processes lowgrade wood into a feedstock for renewable electricity unlocking the full value of forest resources as well as enhancing ecosystems slash pile in british columbia newly developed forest management practises aimed at mitigating against wildfires enhancing areas of habitats for wildlife or restoring fire or diseaseddamaged ecosystems typically generate high volumes of lowgrade wood without a local biomass market that can purchase and make use of that wood theres less incentive to carry out these kinds of activities as wildfires and pests like the mountain pine beetle become increasing threats for canadian forests and the rural communities who depend on them for work and leisure the biomass sectors participation is key to supporting forest management that ensures healthy
