reserve drax power station visit power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station seasonal deployment  powering the clean energy revolution whatever the weather 11 may 2017 britains electricity system has undergone such radical changes that carbon emissions from the sector are now so low the dirtiest hour of generation is cleaner than the average hour from just a few years ago the latest electric insights report  produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax analysed data from january to march 2017 it reveals the dirtiest hour for generation during this winter period was at 830pm on the 16 th january on that cold and calm winter evening 424 grams of co 2 were released per kwh gkwh compare this to the average hour from 2009  2013 when 471 per kwh gkwh was being produced in fact during the first quarter of 2017 emissions dropped by 10 per cent compared to the same period in 2016 and a massive 33 per cent from q1 in 2015 while this years mild winter played an important role in reducing emissions the reduction in the use of coal should not be underestimated policy levers like the carbon tax continued to push coal off the system and the dramatic growth in renewables also reduced its role in january to march 2017 output from coal generation fell by 30 compared to the same quarter in 2016 renewables hit new energy production records wind  113 twh biomass  44 twh hydro  16 twh solar hit a new record peak output 767 gw dr iain staffell of imperial college london said the dirtiest hour in the first quarter of 2017 in terms of carbon intensity from electricity saw 424g of co 2 produced per kwh  that would have seemed clean just a few years ago the average from 2009 to 2013 was 471gkwh however coal output  largely driven by the carbon tax  has fallen 82 in the last four years and has been replaced by midcarbon gas low carbon biomass and imports as well as zero carbon wind and solar together these have driven decarbonisation in line with or even slightly ahead of the countrys targets  which are the most ambitious in the world the rise of intermittent renewables like wind and solar mean that gas coal and biomass fired power stations are often not required throughout the day they are instead being used to power up and down according to the weather and peaks in demand making flexibility more important than ever before while in the winter months we are witnessing record breaking changes in the generation mix the new data from the first quarter of 2017 suggests that this summer is likely to witness an even more dramatic shift in the last weekend of march  for the first time ever  we saw lower daytime than night time demand on the grid this phenomenon was largely driven by the dramatic rise in solar both solar panels and small scale onshore wind are invisible from the grid this means that effectively what they produce reduces what the grid is required to deliver during march demand on the transmission system was 23gw higher at 9am than at 1pm when solar panels achieve maximum output dr staffell predicts that based on previous data this gap is set to double this summer june dr staffell explained that whilst this quarter was a recordbreaker for all renewables including solar the sun often isnt shining at the very times when the country needs the most power  when factories and offices are starting up in the morning  and when people settle down at home for the evening dr staffell said how we manage this changing pattern in demand requires a major change in how power stations operate solar output is still relatively hard to forecast in advance technologies that are flexible and can be turned on and off quickly such as gas or battery storage will help accommodate these changes andy koss drax power ceo said we continue to see dramatic changes in both the generation mix and new demands on the system making reliable flexible power increasingly important seasonal changes are highlighting the changing role that power stations are now playing this new role is set to increase and we will need more nimble technologies which can be up and running at the flick of a switch  like the rapid response gas power stations we are developing this kind of flexible and responsive power generation is vital during times of system stress such as when the sun isnt shining or the wind doesnt blow  it will also enable more intermittent renewables to come onto the grid replacing coal and making the whole system cleaner electric insights will be published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  electricinsightscouk  which provides live data from 2009 until the present the data sources and methodology used in electric insights are listed in full on the website commissioned by drax group owner and operator of the uks largest power station and europes biggest biomassfuelled power plant the report will be delivered independently by dr iain staffell from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the full report can be read here httpselectricinsightscoukdrax_electric_insights_report_2017_q1pdf ends notes to editors electric insights reports that the carbon intensity of electricity averaged 284gkwh during the first quarter of 2017 it ranged from just 102gkwh on a windy sunday night in march to 424gkwh on a cold and calm january evening when coal output was high the lowest carbon intensity hour was 430am on march 19 when there was 078gw of coal generation 44gw gas 7gw nuclear and 120gw renewables previously minimum demand was always during the night and daytime demand never came within 5gw of the night time minimum however this gap narrowed to 24gw in 2015 and on march 25 th 2017 it disappeared completely this meant demand on the national grid was lower during the daytime than it was over night for the first time ever all forms of renewables had a record breaking first quarter of 2017 wind farms recorded their highest quarterly output generating 113twh over the quarter beating coal output for the last consecutive four quarters biomass also hit a new high of 44twh meaning the fleet ran at 95 of full capacity over the quarter higher than any other technology has achieved in the last decade hydro hit 16twh  4 above its previous best in 2014 solar reached peak output of 767gw at the end of march  enough to power a fifth of the country at the time about electric insights electric insights quarterly was commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by national grid and elexon which run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year it will focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009 until the present it was designed by the economist groups independent data design agency signal noise about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future drax operates the largest power station
