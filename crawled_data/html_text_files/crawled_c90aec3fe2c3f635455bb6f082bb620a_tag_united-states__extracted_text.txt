united states carbon removals is a global need the us is making it possible 20 october 2022 carbon capture key takeaways removing carbon from the atmosphere is urgent if we are to meet global climate targets the uss commitment to supporting carbon removal technologies creates an opportunity for new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power stations the market for carbon credits is gaining increasing credibility and verification making it a source of financing for ambitious decarbonization projects carbon markets are needed now to make investment into vital removals projects possible in the us and globally after a summer of soaring temperatures across the northern hemisphere the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in double the loss of tree cover than in 2001 while today more than 23 billion people face water stress from drought its clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too we believe that carbon dioxide co 2  removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge experts and governments agree that in addition to economywide decarbonization removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero co 2 emissions by midcentury the ipcc says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero thats a huge step up from the 40 million tons captured globally in 2021 but also a significant investment opportunity our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of co 2 through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs outside the uk per year while generating renewable baseload electricity and supporting healthy sustainable forests the likely contender for our first location the united states we already operate in communities across the us south employing more than 1200 people in our sustainable biomass pellet production  now we are preparing to build a new beccs power station in the region its clear to us that the us is an ideal market for beccs with its longrunning sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent co 2 storage we see the countrys efforts to retire coal by 2030 and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the us our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year while also generating 2terawatt hours of 247 renewable power the uss newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the inflation reduction act as well as the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent scenario planning for 100 clean electricity system are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies and a new frontier for permanent highquality emissions removals the need for high quality permanent emissions removals a net zero future is only possible through the widespread implementation of highintegrity carbon removals beccs offers this by combining low carbon renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure permanent carbon sequestration beccs works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 as they grow co 2 released in the generation process is captured and stored permanently and safely in geological rock formations the overall process removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it emits resulting in negative emissions this allows us to offer decarbonizing industries highquality carbon removals credits given the scale of co 2 that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero i believe this market for verified co 2 removal credits is a trilliondollar opportunity voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain however increased oversight from investors ngos and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity prompting sustained adoption by businesses drax group ceo will gardiner click to viewdownload weve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at new york climate week the agreement with respira an impactdriven carbon finance business  will allow it to purchase 400000 metric tons of co 2 removals cdrs a year from our north american operations this would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own co 2 emissions reduction targets by purchasing cdrs from respira deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net co 2 emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified highquality emissions reductions as the global economy works towards its net zero targets co 2 removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today beccs stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality permanent carbon removals while also delivering baseload renewable power the ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies as they move away from fossil fuels the potential for the us driven by a dynamic mix of markets investors and engaged consumers some of the most prominent us companies are pledging to reach net zero investing in 247 renewable power and other means to do so technology companies like alphabet apple and microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations supply chains and even remove historic emissions other organizations like the first movers coalition include us companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving difficult decarbonization challenges  this industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action the recent inflation reduction act substantially increases the availability of the 45q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects increasing their value from 50 a ton of carbon removals to 85 per ton helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like beccs we believe the us is on the right track to create a market in which beccs can thrive the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent 100 clean electricity system report includes beccs in three of the four possible scenarios explored it forecasts the us will need between 714gw of installed beccs capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero co 2 emissions that equates to removals of approximately 55120 mt co 2 per year by 2035 the uss established forestry commercial industry with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample lowgrade wood and wood industry residues to power beccs the countrys longrunning exploration of co 2 capture and transport and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills supply chains and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects beccs is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology but action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality action is needed now for responsible businesses with the desire to go further faster or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes carbon removals from beccs deliver real verifiable and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond to net negative its encouraging to see the us pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market however carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community and in the environmental and civil society collaboration between governments corporations and ngos will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency we cant afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures buying and selling highquality permanent removals is the action we need today now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology  united states standing together against climate change will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 27 january 2021 opinion tackling climate change requires global collaboration as a ukus sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the united states and the rest of the world  a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green

drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies 21 march 2018 sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags decarbonisation  investors  supply chain  sustainability  united states  wood pellets active management of forests increases growth and carbon storage 28 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy a study on the historical trends in the forest industry of the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the forest2market report found that increased demand for wood is statistically correlated with more annual tree growth more wood volume available in the forest and more timberland for example between 1953 and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical perspective on the relationship between demand and forest productivity in the us south  an at a
