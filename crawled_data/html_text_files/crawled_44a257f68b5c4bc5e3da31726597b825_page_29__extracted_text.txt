17 february 2020 press releases the transition to renewables led to a 107 million metric tonne reduction in annual carbon emissions from britains power sector sustainable biomass generated more power than solar energy and provided an outsize contribution to reducing emissions and wholesale power prices decrease in power demand was the single biggest driver of emissions decline in the electricity sector in the past decade over the period carbon emissions in britains power sector fell by around two thirds to 54 million metric tonnes in 2019 from 161 million tonnes in 2010 as the countrys generators shifted away from coal and natural gas to renewables such as sustainable biomass electricity demand which fell 13 over the decade delivered around a third of the decline in carbon emissions in the sector over the period while wind energy delivered a quarter of the reduction according to an independent analysis by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights the fall in power demand came even as the population grew by 7 and gdp rose by a quarter as measures such as more energy efficient lighting manufacturing and other efficiency measures took hold however this decline could be reversed in the years ahead with the rise in the use of electric vehicles and household heat pumps meaning further decarbonisation cannot be achieved through a reduction in demand alone the report warns that with the greater reliance on weatherdependent sources system operability will undoubtedly become more difficult in the years to come with a need for increased system support services and greater flexibility dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights reports said in the past decade weve seen unprecedented changes in britains power system which has transformed at a speed never seen before several factors made significant contributions to falling emissions including carbon prices coal retirements conversions to biomass and the growth in wind capacity but reductions in electricity demand dwarfed all the others  helping to push down power prices and environmental impacts if this pace of change can be maintained renewables could provide more than half britains electricity by the end of this decade and the power system could be practically carbon free biomass provided a bigger reduction in emissions and wholesale power prices than solar power relative to the size of its installed capacity according to the report andy koss ceo generation drax click to viewdownload in high res andy koss drax ceo of generation said replacing coal with sustainable biomass at drax has cut our carbon emissions by more than 80 transforming the business to become the largest renewable power generator in the uk accelerating decarbonisation over the decade as well as supporting lower wholesale power prices as the uk strives to achieve its worldleading net zero carbon target its clear the power system will have to continue evolving and many different solutions including negative emissions technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs will be needed alongside more renewables beccs which drax is pioneering has the potential to permanently remove 16 million tonnes of carbon a year from the atmosphere and help other sectors like aviation to reach net zero drax supplies 12 of the

based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more

responds to norwegian oil fund decision 6 february 2020 press releases drax group ceo will gardiner said its great news that the norwegian oil fund has recognised the pioneering transformation at drax converting drax from coal to sustainable biomass has reduced emissions at drax by over 80 since 2013 making us the largest renewable power generator in the uk and the biggest decarbonisation project in europe now were taking it a step further with our worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technology this would anchor a new zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region protecting thousands of jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth in the north and throughout the uk background drax supplies 12 of the uks renewable electricity in december 2019 drax became the first company in the world to announce an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using groundbreaking bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology beccs could be applied to draxs first biomass unit as soon as 2027 by using this vital negative emissions technology drax alone could deliver 16 million tonnes of negative emissions each year from its four generating units creating an anchor for the zero carbon humber initiative its successful one tonne a day beccs pilot was the world first to capture co2 using a 100 biomass feedstock beccs is the only negative emissions technology which generates renewable electricity whilst removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere the uk committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero the norwegian oil fund had previously excluded drax from investment in 2016 following a decision by the norwegian parliament in 2015 to sell out of companies in which more than 30 of revenues or activities are derived from coal zero carbon humber timeline 2026 hydrogen demonstrator and test facility built at drax 2027 beccs technology installed on one biomass generating unit at drax 20282035 beccs technology installed on all four drax biomass units 20282040 hydrogen production scaled up to provide low carbon fuel to multiple industries across the region facts and stats the humber region has around 100 chemical and refining companies which together account for around 12 of total employment in the uk chemicals sector the humber is a strategically important industrial cluster for the uk  it already contributes 18bn towards the uk economy each year driven largely by its deep expertise in industrial processes such as refining petrochemicals and manufacturing it supports 360000 jobs  55000 of which are in the manufacturing sector the humber is the most carbon intensive industrial region in the country  producing 124 million tonnes of co2 from industry each year this does not include emissions from drax or others in the power sector the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero if drax can scale up its beccs pilot it could capture 16 million tonnes of co2 each year ends drax group ceo responds to sustainable aviation report 4 february 2020 press releases todays sustainable aviation report highlights the crucial role negative emissions technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs will play in removing carbon from the atmosphere and helping important sectors of the economy like the aviation industry become net zero carbon drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station near selby in north yorkshire click to viewdownload that is why the uk urgently needs a strategy to invest in and scale up these technologies in the 2020s and 2030s supported by a regulatory framework that enables us to achieve our longterm carbon targets at the lowest possible cost tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage drax group ceo responds to ofgem action plan on decarbonisation 3 february 2020 press releases this action plan places decarbonisation at its heart and sets out positive steps towards a modern network which can support a just transition to netzero alongside investment in the network the uk will need to see support for new sources of flexible generation and system stability as more offshore wind is deployed and the heat and transport sectors become more dependent on electricity drax generates more renewable power than any other company in the uk and we are now working towards becoming carbon negative by 2030  will gardiner at powering past coal alliance event in the uk pavilion at cop25 in madrid click to viewdownload through our biomass pumped storage hydro and gas power stations and our customers we are generating more renewable low carbon and flexible power to support the system as it continues to decarbonise tags decarbonisation  investors  1
