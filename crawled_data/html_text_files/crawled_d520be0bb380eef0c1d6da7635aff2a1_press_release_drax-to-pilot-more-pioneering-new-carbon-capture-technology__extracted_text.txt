nottingham and promethean particles to trial a pioneering new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs process at its north yorkshire power station 10 may 2022 renewable energy giant drax is collaborating with the university of nottingham and promethean particles on an innovative new carbon capture technology that could shape the future of carbon capture and storage ccs trial is part of draxs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs innovation programme and could see the technology deployed in future beccs plants the new process uses a type of solid sorbent called metalorganic frameworks mofs which promethean particles are a global pioneer in the development and deployment of to capture the co2 released when sustainable biomass is used to generate electricity ccs technologies typically use liquid solvents dr theo chronopoulos drax innovation engineer and lewis neve promethean particles engineering manager mofs have a simple structure which means they can be tailored to separate and soak up specific molecules making them excellent for ccs the trial will last for two months and will allow all three organisations to understand if this new carbon capture process performs well in real conditions on largescale projects jason shipstone draxs chief innovation officer said pilot unit in situ in draxs beccs incubation hub located in drax power station negative emissions technologies like beccs will play a vital role in the fight against the climate crisis so its crucial we continue to innovate and develop new technologies that will support their future deployment this partnership with the university of nottingham and promethean particles is part of our longterm innovation programme and will allow drax to understand the future potential of this technology as we continue to innovate and grow as a business professor ed lester project lead university of nottingham said this is a fantastic opportunity to showcase how these solid adsorbents perform in an industrial setting we know that this project is gathering a lot of interest across many industrial sectors that currently generate large amounts of co 2  james stephenson ceo of promethean particles said there is exciting potential for mofs to deliver a more efficient ccs by collaborating with drax and the uni we can show how they can perform in a real industrial setting and drive a step change in their availability and cost effectiveness drax group which has converted drax power station in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the uks largest renewable generator plans to deploy the essential negative emissions technology beccs in the 2020s this would be the worlds largest carbon capture power project delivering a significant

nottingham editors notes the trial will last for two months and will be hosted within draxs beccs incubation hub at its north yorkshire power station metal organic frameworks are a unique class of solid sorbents offering lower operational costs and reducing potential environmental impacts leading climate scientists at the uns ipcc and uk climate change committee have said that negative emissions technologies such as beccs which permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are vital to achieve climate targets work to build beccs at drax could get underway as soon as 2024 with the creation of thousands of jobs subject to the right regulatory support the first beccs unit could be operational in 2027 with the second commissioned in 2030 enabling drax to achieve its worldleading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 analysis by baringa shows beccs at drax will save the uk 13bn in achieving the governments legally binding fifth carbon budget about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate capacity of 46mt which will increase to c5mt once developments are complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers drax is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses supplying 100 renewable electricity as standard to more than 370000 sites through drax and opus energy it
