ken to tongland power station through its six sluice gates built in 1934 the barrage is a critical component of the schemes operations which can produce enough renewable electricity to power 218000 homes ian kinnaird draxs head of hydro said the galloway hydro scheme has been generating flexible renewable electricity for almost a century and this major refurbishment will ensure it continues to do so for many years to come scotland has a long and proud history of hydroelectricity and with this project drax is ensuring these power stations play an important part in securing a net zero carbon future for our country drax acquired the galloway hydro scheme alongside the lanark hydro scheme and the cruachan pumpedhydro storage facility in argyll in january 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible low carbon and renewable power generation over the next three years drax will fully refurbish the barrage alongside its project partners kgal consulting engineers and ajt engineering to ensure the hydro scheme can continue to generate renewable electricity for many decades to come construction of the glenlochar barrage andy neill ajt engineerings divisional manager said we are delighted to be able to support drax on this major project with our extensive experience in this type refurbishment works extending the life span of critical infrastructure for future generations nicholas crosby kgals associate director said a number of our engineers started their careers with the original supplier of the gates so its appropriate that they now apply their skills to extending the life of this structure commissioned in the mid1930s the galloway hydro scheme was the first largescale integrated hydroelectric complex to be built in britain and consists of six power stations eight dams and a network of tunnels aqueducts and pipelines at its peak during construction more than 1500 people were employed on the project ends editors notes local people will be kept informed of the project by drax and its contractors through community information sessions as piece of key infrastructure the barrage will remain operational throughout the refurbishment to manage

plant as a technical apprentice said it has been a very uncertain time for young people like me looking to start their careers over the last few months because of covid to not only secure an engineering apprenticeship but one based at draxs daldowie plant is incredibly exciting this is the second time drax has invested in apprenticeships at its scottish sites since it acquired them as part of a wider portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable assets at the start of last year the continued investment in young people has been welcomed by the scottish government jamie hepburn skills minister said as we recover from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic it is vital that we continue to develop scotlands young workforce to equip people with the skills they need to succeed while meeting the emerging needs and opportunities of our employers and economy apprenticeships are not only valuable for our young people they are a fantastic way for all employers to invest in their workforce and provide the skills the economy needs now and in the future i am delighted that drax continues to nurture new talent by appointing apprentices as part of its commitment to stem skills and training i would also like to take this opportunity to wish all those starting out in a new career the very best draxs technical apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers it is a fouryear programme and specialises in three engineering disciplines mechanical electrical and control  instrumentation

lockdown made britains electricity system cleaner and cheaper but harder to control 31 august 2020 press releases latest drax electric insights report shows renewables up 32 yearonyear as biomass wind and solar set new generation records in q2 2020 cleanest ever quarter as carbon emissions fall by a third compared to the same period last year and the carbon intensity of electricity fell to an alltime low of 21 gkwh on the spring bank holiday wholesale power prices down 42 from same quarter last year as demand plummets during lockdown cost to balance the grid rises to over 100 million per month as pumped hydro storage and ccgts called on to manage low demand and high generation from wind and solar sources as businesses shut up shop and millions of people were furloughed or working from home during the second quarter of 2020 independent analysis  conducted via imperial consultants by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights shows the impact this had on our electricity system lower electricity demand combined with exceptional weather propelled renewables to their greatest ever share of electricity forcing prices and carbon emissions down to record levels as well as reducing the need for nuclear and fossil fuel power at one point renewable electricity sources were providing almost 70 695 of britains electricity the report also highlights how this combination of reduced demand and increased renewable generation meant a record amount of money was spent on keeping the system stable between april and june the quarterlyaverage cost of balancing the power system expressed as a percentage of the cost of generation click to viewdownload dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights reports said the past few months have given the country a glimpse into the future for our power system with higher levels of renewable energy and lower demand make for a difficult balancing act to help the country decarbonise further it is vital that flexible technologies which provide power and system stability play an increasing role in our grid alongside keeping power supply and demand perfectly in balance national grid eso must also stabilise the system it does this by ensuring there is not just the right amount of megawatts available to meet demand  but also the right kind of mws during q2 wind and solar power provided a lot of the electricity required by the grid which helped the carbon intensity fall to 153 gkwh averaged over the quarter  its lowest on record however these technologies are unable to provide all the services needed to stabilise the system such as inertia which is essential for maintaining the grids frequency at 50hz and preventing power cuts whilst wholesale prices fell 42 as a result of falling demand during the period balancing prices rose from being just 5 of wholesale prices typically over the last decade to 20 with the cost of the actions taken to stabilise the system averaging 100 million per month during the first half of this year mike maudsley drax groups uk portfolio generation director mike maudsley drax groups uk portfolio generation director said it

with a new design to put the station at the cutting edge of energy technology to improve cruachans efficiency worldleading control system builders iti will undertake the design installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the stations four units cruachan plays a critical role in stabilising the countrys electricity system throughout the covid19 pandemic due to its flexibility the plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in scotland the plants reversible turbines pump water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases in july cruachan became the first power station in britain to provide critical system support services to the national grid as part of a worldfirst stability contract aimed at reducing the threat of blackouts ian kinnaird drax groups head of hydro said cruachan plays a critical role in supporting renewable energy in scotland and stabilising the electricity grid as the country continues to decarbonise the stations flexibility has never been more important this upgrade will ensure the hollow mountain can deliver the fast flexible power that hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses rely on for many decades to come control room operator at cruachan power
