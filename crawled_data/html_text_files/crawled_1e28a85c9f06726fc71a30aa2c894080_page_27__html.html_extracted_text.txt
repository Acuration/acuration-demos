Drax to stop using coal well ahead of UK’s deadline
27 February 2020
Press releases

Drax has announced that almost 50 years of power generation from coal at its power station in North Yorkshire, is expected to end next year – years in advance of the UK’s 2025 deadline
The decision is a landmark moment in the UK’s efforts to achieve net zero by 2050 and a major milestone towards delivering Drax’s world-leading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030
Drax is also spearheading a Zero Carbon Skills Taskforce to help people in the North gain the skills and expertise required to seize the opportunities as the UK moves towards a net zero carbon economy
Almost 50 years of coal-fired electricity generation at Drax Power Station is expected to come to an end in March 2021 – marking a major milestone in the company’s world-leading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030.
It means the country’s largest power station will stop using coal well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline, making an even bigger contribution to the UK’s efforts to achieve net zero.
The decision to stop using coal at Drax comes after a comprehensive review of its operations. Drax does not expect to use coal after March 2021, but will ensure its two remaining coal units remain available until September 2022 in line with its existing Capacity Market agreements.
Drax CEO Will Gardiner said:
“Ending the use of coal at Drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a world-leading carbon negative company by 2030. Drax’s journey away from coal began some years ago and I’m proud to say we’re going to finish the job well ahead of the Government’s 2025 deadline.”
Drax Power Station near Selby in North Yorkshire first started generating electricity using coal in the 1970s. Once the second half of the power station was built in the 1980s, it became the largest power station in the UK with the capacity to generate electricity for six million households.
Over the last decade four of the power station’s six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass, delivering carbon savings of more than 80% compared to when they used coal.
This has transformed Drax to become the UK’s largest renewable power generator and the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Mr Gardiner said:
“By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK’s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.
“Having pioneered ground-breaking biomass technology, we’re now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030, making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.”
Stopping using coal at Drax will lead to a reduction in the workforce at the North Yorkshire power station. Trades Unions and employee representatives will be consulted over the coming months and support is being provided to those affected.

Drax is talking to the government, trades unions and industrial businesses across the North about joining with Drax in establishing a new Zero Carbon Skills Taskforce to help people in the region gain the skills and expertise required to seize new job opportunities as the UK moves towards a net zero economy.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner in the control room at Drax Power Station. Click to view/download.
Mr Gardiner added:
“Stopping using coal is the right decision for our business, our communities and the environment, but it will have an impact on some of our employees, which will be difficult for them and their families.
“In making the decision for the UK to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy, it’s vital that the impact on people across the North is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that they have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future.”
Drax’s plans to develop BECCS means it could be the ‘anchor’ for the
Zero Carbon Humber
initiative which aims to bring industrial businesses together to make the region the first net zero industrial economy in the world.
The Humber is the UK’s biggest industrial region employing 55,000 people in energy, manufacturing and engineering and as the most carbon intensive region in the country – decarbonising here would make a more significant impact on addressing the climate crisis than anywhere else in the UK.

Editor’s Notes
Drax Group has reported profits of £410m in its
2019 Full Year Results
published today.
The Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, recently
announced
it was revoking an exclusion of Drax Group from its investments, recognising the company’s move away from coal to biomass, which delivers carbon savings of more than 80%.
The end of coal generation will lead to a reduction in the workforce at Drax Power Station of between 200 and 230 people from April 2021.
Drax’s decision to stop using coal is an important step in achieving its ambition to become
carbon negative
. This means that by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology, Drax will remove more carbon emissions from the atmosphere than are produced across all its operations, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.
By using BECCS, Drax hopes to become the anchor for
the UK’s first net zero industrial cluster
in the Humber region, allowing other industrial emitters to capture and store carbon dioxide, protecting jobs, creating clean growth and export opportunities.
Drax is a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an initiative launched by the UK and Canadian governments, which seeks to end the use of unabated coal in power stations around the world by 2030.
The Powering Past Coal Alliance wants to accelerate the transition away from unabated coal and Drax is supporting its work to encourage members to scale up their ambitions, and to create more collaboration, helping prospective new members to move forwards in using cleaner energy.
Drax supports STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) education and employability initiatives in the communities local to its operations. In 2019 it recruited 18 apprentices across the Group including 13 at Drax Power Station. It also works with schools and colleges to deliver exciting STEM education opportunities and careers events and activities, which promote diversity and inclusion.
More than 9,500 people visited Drax Power Station in 2019, many of whom were students. The tours are free and are focused on learning outcomes.

Renewables revolution delivers decade of decarbonisation
17 February 2020
Press releases

The transition to renewables led to a 107 million metric tonne reduction in annual carbon emissions from Britain’s power sector.
Sustainable biomass generated more power than solar energy and provided an outsize contribution to reducing emissions and wholesale power prices.
Decrease in power demand was the single biggest driver of emissions decline in the electricity sector in the past decade.
Over the period, carbon emissions in Britain’s power sector fell by around two thirds to 54 million metric tonnes in 2019 from 161 million tonnes in 2010 as the country’s generators shifted away from coal and natural gas to renewables such as sustainable biomass.
Electricity demand, which fell 13% over the decade, delivered around a third of the decline in carbon emissions in the sector over the period, while wind energy delivered a quarter of the reduction, according to an independent analysis by academics from Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights.
The fall in power demand came even as the population grew by 7% and GDP rose by a quarter as measures such as more energy efficient lighting, manufacturing and other efficiency measures took hold.
However, this decline could be reversed in the years ahead with the rise in the use of electric vehicles and household heat pumps, meaning further decarbonisation cannot be achieved through a reduction in demand alone.
The
report
warns that with the greater reliance on weather-dependent sources ‘system operability will undoubtedly become more difficult in the years to come’, with a need for increased system support services and greater flexibility.
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London and lead author of the quarterly Electric Insights reports said:
“In the past decade, we’ve seen unprecedented changes in Britain’s power system, which has transformed at a speed never seen before.
“Several factors made significant contributions to falling emissions including carbon prices, coal retirements, conversions to biomass and the growth in wind capacity. But reductions in electricity demand dwarfed all the others – helping to push down power prices and environmental impacts.
“If this pace of change can be maintained, renewables could provide more than half Britain’s electricity by the end of this decade and the power system could be practically carbon free.”
Biomass provided a bigger reduction in emissions and wholesale power prices than solar power relative to the size of its installed capacity, according to the report.
Andy Koss, CEO Generation, Drax. Click to view/download in high res.
Andy Koss, Drax CEO of Generation, said:
“Replacing coal with sustainable biomass at Drax has cut our carbon emissions by more than 80%, transforming the business to become the largest renewable power generator in the UK, accelerating decarbonisation over the decade as well as supporting lower wholesale power prices.
“As the UK strives to achieve its world-leading net zero carbon target, it’s clear the power system will have to continue evolving and many different solutions, including negative emissions technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), will be needed alongside more renewables.
“BECCS, which Drax is pioneering, has the potential to permanently remove 16 million tonnes of carbon a year from the atmosphere and help other sectors like aviation to reach net zero.”
Drax supplies 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity using sustainable biomass. Last year, the company set a world leading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030.

Editor’s Notes
Decarbonisation facts over the past decade – from Electric Insights:
Great Britain’s power system has decarbonised faster than anywhere else in the world.
Emissions from electricity consumption fell by 64%.
Installed capacity of renewables in 2019 (38.5GW) was more than seven times higher than the installed base in 2010 (5.2GW).
Compared to 2010, biomass is now saving an annual nine million tonnes of carbon emissions and £2.8/MWh in wholesale prices versus six million tonnes and £2/MWh a year from solar.
Over the last decade, biomass produced 88.1 TWh compared to 59.86 TWh from solar despite the latter having a far greater installed capacity.

Applefields School visits Europe’s biggest carbon saving project
11 February 2020
Press releases

The group of seven students from Applefields School in York, visited Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, which has upgraded two thirds of its generating capacity to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal.
This has transformed the plant to become the UK’s largest renewable power generator – producing enough electricity for four million homes – and Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
It has also paved the way for Drax to pioneer ground-breaking bio energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology. If BECCS can be used across all four of its biomass generating units, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station, helping it to make an even greater contribution towards tackling the climate emergency.
Pupils were taken on a full tour of the site including the innovative BECCS pilot plant which is capturing a tonne of CO2 each day, the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the six huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity.
They also enjoyed a close-up view of the UK’s first wood pellet storage domes, each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 12 cooling towers, which at 115 metres high are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Drax Group’s Head of Business Sustainability, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“By providing tours at Drax Power Station we want to further students’ understanding of how electricity is produced and hopefully fire their imaginations and inspire them to study STEM subjects by showing them some of the pioneering technologies we’re trying, like BECCS, which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis.”
During the tour, pupils learnt how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable, compressed wood pellets have enabled Drax to reduce its carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to when those generating units used coal.
Annika Hatfield, from Applefields School, who organised the visit, said:
“The students had a great day at Drax, learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated. Visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom – it really brings the subject to life.”
Drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the engineers of the future by encouraging greater interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. Earlier this year it invested £35,000
in the GreenPower initiative
involving seven local schools and colleges in building and racing electric vehicles.
The Applefields students are among over 12,000 visitors to Drax every year. Tours are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be tailored to suit the area of the curriculum teachers are interested in.

Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner responds to Norwegian oil fund decision
6 February 2020
Press releases

Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner said:
“It’s great news that the Norwegian oil fund has recognised the pioneering transformation at Drax. Converting Drax from coal to sustainable biomass has reduced emissions at Drax by over 80% since 2013, making us the largest renewable power generator in the UK and the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe.
“Now we’re taking it a step further with our world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technology. This would anchor a new zero carbon industrial cluster in the Humber region, protecting thousands of jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth in the north and throughout the UK.”
Background:
Drax supplies 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity
In December 2019, Drax became the first company in the world to announce an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using ground-breaking bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
BECCS could be applied to Drax’s first biomass unit as soon as 2027. By using this vital negative emissions technology, Drax alone could deliver 16 million tonnes of negative emissions each year from its four generating units, creating an anchor for the Zero Carbon Humber initiative.
Its successful one tonne a day BECCS pilot was the world’ first to capture CO2 using a 100% biomass feedstock
BECCS is the only negative emissions technology which generates renewable electricity whilst removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s ‘Net Zero’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO2 – around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
The Norwegian oil fund had previously excluded Drax from investment in 2016 following a decision by the Norwegian parliament in 2015 to sell out of companies in which more than 30% of revenues or activities are derived from coal.

2028-2040:
Hydrogen production scaled up to provide low carbon fuel to multiple industries across the region.
Facts and stats:
The Humber region has around 100 chemical and refining companies, which together account for around 12% of total employment in the UK chemicals sector.
The Humber is a strategically important industrial cluster for the UK – it already contributes £18bn towards the UK economy each year, driven largely by its deep expertise in industrial processes such as refining, petrochemicals and manufacturing.
It supports 360,000 jobs – 55,000 of which are in the manufacturing sector.
The Humber is the most carbon intensive industrial region in the country – producing 12.4 million tonnes of CO2 from industry each year. (This does not include emissions from Drax or others in the power sector).
The Committee on Climate Change’s ‘Net Zero’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO
2
– around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
If Drax can scale up its BECCS pilot it could capture 16 million tonnes of CO2 each year.

Negative emissions pioneer Drax announces new CCUS projects during Energy Minister’s visit
30 January 2020
Press releases

Cleantech companies Econic Technologies and Deep Branch Biotechnology are the latest businesses to begin work with world-leader in negative emissions, Drax Group.
The projects have the potential to use carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies to enable other sectors to decarbonise, making a significant contribution to UK efforts to address the climate emergency.
UK Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth, Kwasi Kwarteng, visited Drax to hear more about its ambitious plan to become carbon negative by 2030 using ground-breaking bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology – and met with some of the businesses it is working with on CCUS.
(Click to download) Clare Harbord, Jason Shipstone (both Drax) with Kwasi Kwarteng MP, and Will Gardiner Drax Group CEO and Andy Koss, Drax CEO Generation.
Negative emissions pioneer, Drax Group is continuing to develop ground-breaking carbon capture technologies through new partnerships and pilot projects, putting UK businesses at the forefront of efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
Drax has announced a new partnership with cleantech company Econic Technologies to explore the potential for using captured carbon dioxide from its biomass power generation to displace oil in the production of plastic products, using its pioneering catalyst technology.
The partnership marks a major step towards enabling other businesses, including in the automotive, consumer and construction sectors, to produce more sustainable polyurethane products. Econic’s catalyst technology could save as much as the equivalent of four million petrol cars’ worth of CO
2
per year in this first market alone.
A new pilot plant has also been installed at the power station in North Yorkshire, by Deep Branch Biotechnology to
explore the feasibility
of using Drax’s CO
2
emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products – technology which could enable the agricultural sector to decarbonise.
The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, UK Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth visited the CCUS Incubation Hub at Drax Power Station, to see for himself the pioneering work taking place.
Drax was
the first company in the world
to announce an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 when CEO Will Gardiner spoke at COP 25 in Madrid. By applying BECCS technology to its biomass generating units Drax would remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces across the whole of its operations, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said:
“Drax’s ambition is to be carbon negative by 2030.  Having pioneered the use of sustainable biomass, Drax now produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity. With the right negative emissions policy for BECCS, we can do much more, removing millions of tonnes of emissions from the atmosphere each year.
“By working with innovative tech companies like Econic and Deep Branch Biotechnology, we are exploring new opportunities for clean growth, which could be critical not only for beating the climate crisis, but also in enabling a just transition, protecting jobs across the North – delivering for the economy and the environment.”
Econic Technologies will test the CO
2
being captured from Drax’s successful one tonne a day BECCS pilot at its own industrial pilot facility, to assess its suitability for producing polymers used in polyurethane plastics.

Dr Rowena Sellens, Econic Technologies CEO, said:
“Tackling climate change requires collaboration at all levels, and the Econic and Drax partnership is a significant step forward as industries establish viable, sustainable solutions. This project has the scope to unlock the endless potential of CO
2
across a vast number of sectors. We’re confident that the CO
2
being captured by Drax will be suitable for use in our process, meaning that we could move forwards to explore potential commercial opportunities together and accelerate the roll-out of both our technologies and their positive climate impact.”

Drax is also working with a number of businesses to deliver
a Zero Carbon Humber
by 2040 – CO
2
from Drax and other industrial emitters across the region, could be captured, transported and then stored under the North Sea creating the UK’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in line with UK government targets.

Editor’s Notes
Econic Technologies has pioneered a catalyst that allows bespoke amounts of CO
2
to replace up to 50% of the traditional fossil fuel-based materials used in polymer production.
The polyurethanes produced have a wide range of uses, such as in producing products for the automotive sector, consumer goods, home furnishings as well as insulation for buildings.
Drax has installed storage cylinders to compress and store small quantities of the CO
2
being captured from its successful BECCS pilot, which will enable Econic to test its suitability for use in its processes. These will be commissioned in the coming weeks. Once running they have the capacity to store up to 6kg of CO
2
to enable testing to be carried out.
Businesses across the Humber region are
supporting the Zero Carbon Humber campaign
. As the most carbon intensive region in the country – the Humber would be able to make a more significant impact on addressing the climate emergency than anywhere else in the UK.
Drax is continuing work with C-Capture, using funding from the government’s CCUS innovation fund for
work to test and validate
the BECCS technology it is piloting. This is due to be completed later this year.
By applying BECCS technology to all four of its biomass generating units, Drax could capture and store 16 million tonnes or more of CO
2
a year – a significant proportion of the UK’s target.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s ‘
Net Zero
’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO
2
– around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.

About Econic Technologies
Econic Technologies is a British cleantech company that has pioneered catalyst technologies for utilisation of Carbon Dioxide (CO
2
) in place of conventional oil-based feedstocks. Its tailored catalyst systems enable the utilisation of captured CO
2
as a feedstock for manufacturing polyols, a precursor of plastics like polyurethanes, on an industrial scale.
In 2018, Econic Technologies received investment from OGCI Climate Investments, a voluntary initiative led by CEOs of 13 global oil and gas companies, which invest in promising technologies and business models that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that are commercially viable and scalable. In 2019, Econic was also named on the prestigious Global CLEANTECH 100 list. These developments follow investment from the likes of IP Group plc and Jetstream Capital, as well as a Horizon 2020 SME award secured in 2016, which have helped the company accelerate the commercialisation of its catalyst technologies.
The company operates globally from Alderley Park, near Manchester, UK and its state-of-the-art customer demonstration facility in Runcorn, UK, which has seen 60 customers visit since opening in March 2018. Econic Technologies is working with global polyol producers across North America, Europe and Asia as part of a programme to accelerate adoption of its catalyst technologies across these territories.
Founded in 2011 by Charlotte Williams, now Professor at Oxford University, and David Morgan, formerly Executive Director of FTSE 100 catalyst company Johnson Matthey plc, Econic’s unique technologies allow bespoke amounts of CO
2
to be used (up to 50%) as a raw material in the manufacture of polyols with enhanced properties for value added products. This enables producers to benefit from substantial raw material feedstock cost savings and achieve significant environmental benefits from both CO
2
utilisation and reduced CO
2
emissions, while also enabling the potential for economic gain via an ability to offer enhanced product performance to users.
About polyols
Polyols are the building block for polyurethanes and are used in the production of flexible and rigid foams, elastomers, adhesives, sealants and coatings. Industry sectors include: automotive, footwear & apparel (e.g. sports trainers), furniture (sofas, mattresses etc), appliances (e.g. fridges) and construction (insulation panels, coatings etc). The global polyols market is valued at $24Bn and is growing.
