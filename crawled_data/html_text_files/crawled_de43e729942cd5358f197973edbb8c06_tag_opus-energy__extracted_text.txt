opus energy turning waste into watts 3 september 2020 sustainable bioenergy think of carbon emissions and the image that comes to mind is often of industrial sites or power generation  not of what we eat and what we throw away but food waste is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions globally food loss and waste from across the food chain generates the equivalent of 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  a year  or about 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions but what if there was a way to reduce those emissions and generate power by using discarded food and other organic waste like grass cuttings or nut shells a technology known as anaerobic digestion is increasingly making this idea a reality how anaerobic digestion works all organic waste products have energy in them but its tied up in the form of calories when food and vegetation rots microorganisms break down those calories into gases and other products methane or ammonium molecules exactly what these other products are depends on whether there is any oxygen present with oxygen the products are water co 2 and ammonia but remove oxygen from the equation and a very valuable gas is produced methane ch 4  the lack of oxygen is also what gives anaerobic digestion its name  when oxygen is present it becomes aerobic digestion during the anaerobic digestion process bacteria and other microorganisms break down organic matter gradually deteriorating complex polymers like glucose or starch into progressively simpler elements such as alcohol ammonia co 2 and ultimately ch 4  a biogas with huge potential as a fuel for other processes anaerobic power in practice the ch 4 produced in anaerobic digestion is incredibly useful as a fuel  turn on a gas hob or stovetop and its predominantly methane that provides the fuel for the flame the chemical compound is also the main component in the natural gas that makes up much of great britains electricity supply this means using anaerobic digestion to create ch 4 out of waste products turns that waste into a valuable power source but its not as simple as putting a bag over a rubbish tip and hoping for the best instead anaerobic digestion is carried out in large tanks called digesters these are filled with feedstocks from biological substances that can include anything from food scraps to alcohol and distillery waste to manure under the right conditions microorganisms and bacteria begin to digest and breakdown these substances into their basic elements the air quantity and temperature of the digesters is carefully regulated to ensure the microorganisms have the best possible environment to carry out the digestion of the feedstock with different types of feedstock and microorganisms operating best in different conditions the biogas created as a result of this digestion is then captured ready to be turned into something useful making use of biogas three different things can happen to the biogas produced during the course of the digestion locally it can be combusted onsite to provide further heat to regulate the temperature of the anaerobic digestion units or it can be combusted in a combined heat and power chp generator where it can generate electricity to be used on site  for example to power a farm  or sold through energy suppliers such as opus energy onto wider regional or national electricity networks this biogas electricity is an important element of great britains energy supply accounting for 6600 gwh or 73 of all power generated by solid and gaseous fuels in 2017 some of the biogas can even be cleaned to remove co 2  leaving behind pure methane that can be pumped onto natural gas grids and used to provide heat and power to households government research estimates a fully utilised biogas sector could provide up to 30 of the uks household gas demands  after the digestion process has been completed and the biogas has been removed what is left behind in the digester is a mass of solid matter called digestate this is extremely rich in nutrients and mineral such as potassium and nitrogen making it an excellent soil enhancer where anaerobic digestion is being used today today much of anaerobic digestion power is generated on farms  unsurprisingly given the ready access to biological waste material to use as feedstock as well as a potential source of electricity and heat it also gives farmers access to a new revenue stream by selling electricity or biogas as well as reducing utility and fertiliser costs while many of these installations are smaller scale some can get quite big linstock castle farm in north cumbria for example has a biogas facility with a 11 megawattmw operating capacity enough to power as many as 2000 homes at a time it was originally installed by the farmers as a more costeffective way of growing their business than buying more dairy cows there is however potential for anaerobic digestion to operate on an even larger scale in the us the city of philadelphia is developing a system that will link all newly built households together into a network where food waste is automatically collected and transported to a biogas generating facility closer to home northumbrian water uses 100 of its sludge the waste produced from purifying water to produce renewable power via anaerobic digestion  its estimated to have reduced the carbon footprint of the facilitys operations by around 20 and saved millions of pounds in savings on operating costs there have also been experiments with using biogas to power vehicles the biobus was the first bus in the uk to be powered by biomethane made from food sewage and commercial liquid waste and ran between bath and bristol airport but anaerobic digestion power is not a magic bullet it will be right in certain situations but not all if utilised effectively anaerobic digestion and biogas could fill a vital role in national electricity and gas networks while at the same time helping dispose of waste products in an environmentallyfriendly and costeffective way tags gas  biomass energy  customers  electricity generation  opus energy  renewable energy opus energys contingency plans for coronavirus 19 march 2020 sustainable business httpswwwopusenergycomblogourcontingencyplansforcoronavirus tags customers  opus energy  communities  covid19 how getting renewable energy from your supplier actually works 2 april 2019 sustainable bioenergy where does our electricity come from one answer might be the power stations wind turbines and solar panels that generate it you might even go as far as to say the wind sun water biomass and gas powering those stations or even the network companies transporting that power around the country but theres also a very important middleman in this process electricity suppliers most of great britain gets its power from one of the big six energy suppliers which buy electricity from the wholesale market and then sells it to consumers however with more businesses and consumers looking for less carbonintense electricity sources there are now a whole host of smaller companies taking on the incumbents and offering allrenewable electricity from ovo to bulb to draxs own haven power and opus energy  consumers and businesses have more and greener options than ever about where to buy their electricity with many even offering 100 renewable electricity but how do these companies ensure the megawatts powering homes offices and street lights come from renewable sources cleaning up the river the electricity we use doesnt just flow through a single cable from a power station to our houses it travels through whats called the transmissions system which is run by national grid eso and local distribution network operators  apart from offgrid installations like solar panels on buildings some of which are unable to export their unused power all the electricity generated by different sources around the country goes into this same system it means megawatts generated by a wind turbine get mixed up with those generated by a nuclear reactor or a coal power station think of it as a river although it is its own entity it is fed by multiple streams of water coming from different sources in the case of electricity megawatts from various generators are fed into a central system which then enter homes offices and devices around the country so what makes green power generated from renewable sources green power used in homes suppliers cant control exactly what megawatts you use but they can influence the makeup of the overall river your electricity is pulled from by what electricity they agree to buy and offer to their customers renewable suppliers match the amount of electricity their customers use with the amount they buy from renewable sources so if a home uses 4 megawatthours mwh a year  a supplier will need to ensure it buys an equal amount of power from national grid which national grid sources from generators if that supplier offers 100 renewable power it will need to ensure it has the right kinds of deals in place with renewable generators to deliver that amount of power it means that while the river of electricity is still a mix from different streams more of the water will come from renewable streams therefore if more homes and businesses switch to renewable suppliers more of the overall river will be renewable which will in turn help to decarbonise the electricity system enabling a lowercarbon economy but how does this fit into the existing electricity business and infrastructure but how do suppliers actually buy renewable power from generators the business of electricity to understand how suppliers ensure they are buying renewable power you first need to understand how the business works or at least how it used to the most obvious place to start is with the generators be they gas power stations or an offshore wind farm the generator is where electricity is produced and are often owned by a supplier suppliers can buy electricity from their own generators often months or years ahead of delivery but if there is a shortfall the supplier can also buy electricity on the wholesale market where other generators can sell their electricity because suppliers are on a competitive market their aim is to buy the electricity for the lowest possible price and sell it for more  but at a better rate than rivals measures like carbon prices or green incentives help lower the cost of renewable and lowcarbon generation and position it as a more economically viable purchase than more expensive fossil fuels like coal  renewableonly suppliers also want to buy electricity as cheap as possible and sell it as affordably as possible but unlike standard suppliers they only buy electricity from renewable sources this can be done by purchasing electricity from independent renewable generators on the wholesale market or arranged through what are known as power purchase agreements  ppas   longerterm contracts between generators and suppliers agreeing on a specific amount of power the advantage of these for the renewable generator is it secures revenue for the future while for the supplier it means a dependable source of electricity for large installations these deals are often signed before construction even begins to ensure investors there will be a return transitioning to a lowcarbon electricity system however is not just about suppliers buying more electricity from renewable sources the future of electricity suppliers as more businesses individuals and communities are becoming prosumers and generating their own electricity the wider role of the supplier in the system is changing the governments feedintariffs financially reward customers for generating their own electricity even if they dont export it to the grid but even small generators can sign deals with suppliers to sell electricity through schemes such as good energys smartgen policy which is open to generators with between 10 and 100 kilowatts kw of installed capacity similarly opus energy helps over 2100 businesses sell more than 1100 gigawatthours gwh of excess wind solar anaerobic digestion and hydro power for larger prosumer businesses the relationship with suppliers and the grid is different rather than the traditional buying and selling of electricity it requires a cooperative approach to understand how the prosumer can best utilise their assets  beyond increasing the amount of lowcarbon electricity decarbonising the electricity system also means making more efficient use of energy and managing the data that can help improve efficiency haven powers partnership with thames water sees it analyse an average of 68 million halfhour smart meter readings every year using the data to help the company improve its billing and forecasting as the wider system becomes more intelligent suppliers will be able to better forecast how much electricity its customers use and help them reduce their consumption the role required of suppliers in a changing system will create opportunities for more renewable and efficient use of electricity and empower more consumers to get their electricity from lowcarbon sources that can help to make the whole countrys electricity greener want a different perspective on the same story watch tvs jonny ball explain  tags renewable energy  opus energy

engineer at drax power station its a sentiment echoed by corporate administration apprentice chloe carpenter at opus energy asked to describe her role she says its a very different kind of job chloe and sam are just two of a number of apprentices at drax group who are working across the uk and while theyre proud to do things differently they do have something in common  theyre all handson practical people who would rather get stuck in on a project than sit still and hear about it in the classroom i chose an apprenticeship over higher education because im more of a doing person says molly fensome a corporate administration apprentice sam agrees i like to be handson he says i dont like being sat in a classroom they are doing things their way  engineering their own futures while growing personally and professionally and ensuring the future of our energy supply in the process finding a strong sense of identity for sam working at drax wasnt just a sensible career move it was also following in his familys footsteps my grandad worked in the power station industry all his life my family know exactly what im like and they knew what type of place this was to work draxs transformation from a coalpowered plant to a modern sustainable electricity company means sams work is building a power framework for future generations while also paying homage to his grandads career jake dawson an electrical engineer apprentice followed a similar path into the power industry being born and bred in the area drax power station has always been a part of his geography because im such a local lad it was perfect for me he says in his role jake can play a key part in the region where he grew up a recent oxford economics report shows that drax contributes 431 million to yorkshire and the humber economy and supports over 3200 jobs a role in a team drax is a large organisation but for chloe finding role models within her team she can look up to and take guidance from has been easy mentoring sessions are relaxed and you build a special bond with that person she says you can talk to them about work outside of work  anything theyll always be there for you corporate administration apprentice matt donnelly has had a similar experience adding that hes seen his confidence grow and feels he has made lifelong friends in his role ultimately its not just that they are given the right support but that apprentices are integrated as a part of the company from day one my favourite part of my apprenticeship so far is being part of the team says chloe because you feel like youre not just an apprentice but youre also one of them  being part of something bigger sam remembers his first day at drax power station it was overwhelming you dont actually realise how big it is and realise how many people work here its just normal now if i go anywhere else im thinking thats not as big as at work its not just its size that makes the uks biggest single site renewable power station stand out but the potential for career development there its this that jake had on his mind when he first made the decision to become an apprentice he was working in an unskilled job with little opportunity but he knew he had it in him to find something bigger his outlook today as a drax apprentice is very different my aim after the four years is to carry on growing as a person increasing all my skills that i have and maybe eventually becoming a supervisor or an engineer who knows this mindset of striving for better is evident across apprentices its what drove them to join the programme in the first place instead of going somewhere like uni and then possibly coming out without a job youve got a job and youre actually learning as youre doing it says sam the skill set that ive learnt now  ill probably go anywhere in the world with it find out more about apprenticeships at drax tags opus energy  careers  apprenticeships  drax power station chief executives review will gardiner chief

generation heating transport and the wider economy through our flexible lower carbon electricity proposition and business to business b2b energy solutions the group is positioning itself for growth in this environment more details can be seen on page 4 of our annual report  our strategy our purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used through addressing uk energy needs and those of our customers our strategy is designed to deliver growing earnings and cash flow alongside significant cash returns for shareholders our ambition is to grow our ebitda to over 425 million by 2025 with over a third of those earnings coming from pellet production and b2b energy supply to create a broader more balanced earnings profile we intend to pay a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders progression towards these targets is underpinned by safety sustainability operational excellence and expertise in our markets summary of 2017 we made significant progress during 2017 but were below our expectations on the challenging scorecard targets we set ourselves in pellet production and biomass availability the latter reflecting the significant incident we experienced on our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2017 which extended into january 2018 energy supply performed well with opus energy in line with plan and haven power exceeding its targets through a combination of this performance and the progress of our strategy we have delivered ebitda of 229 million significantly ahead of 2016 140 million and with each of our three businesses contributing positive ebitda for the first time the group scorecard is reported in full in the remuneration report  pp 81107 of our annual report  and the kpis are also shown below they reflect the diversity of our operations and our need to maintain clear focus on delivering operational excellence on a statutory basis we recorded a loss of 151 million which reflects unrealised losses on derivative contracts previously announced accounting policy on the accelerated depreciation on coalspecific assets as well as amortisation of newly acquired intangible assets in opus energy we also calculate underlying earnings a profit after tax of 27 million which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and to assess the performance of the group without the income statement volatility introduced by noncash fair value adjustments on our portfolio of forward commodity and currency futures contracts during the year we refinanced our existing debt facilities reducing our debt cost we also confirmed a new dividend policy which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend 50 million in respect of 2017 consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth at year end our net debt was 91 million below our 2x net debt to ebitda target providing additional headroom there is more detail on our financial performance in the group financial review on page 46 of our annual report  in the us our pellet production operations recorded yearonyear growth in output of 35 with our first two plants now producing at full capacity during the second half of 2017 we also completed the installation of additional capacity enabling our morehouse and amite facilities to handle a greater amount of residue material supporting efforts to produce good quality pellets at the lowest cost as part of our target to expand our biomass selfsupply capability we completed the acquisition of lasalle bioenergy lasalle adding pellet production capacity lasalle commenced commissioning in november 2017 and due to its close proximity to our existing us facilities once complete will provide further opportunities for supply chain optimisation as in 2016 we benefited from the flexibility of selfsupply this often overlooked attribute of our supply chain enables us to manage biomass supply across the power generation business planned outage season and to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the shortterm spot market in power generation we experienced a significant incident on our biomass rail unloading facilities including a small fire on a section of conveyor we fully investigated the incident and following repairs over the christmas period have now recommissioned the facility with enhanced operating procedures this is a timely reminder of the combustible nature of biomass and the need for strong controls and processes to protect our people and assets our biomass units continued to produce high levels of renewable electricity from sustainable wood pellets for the uk market  drax produced 15 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power sheffield leeds liverpool and manchester combined in doing so we are making a vital contribution to the uks ambitious targets for decarbonisation across electricity generation heating and transport  an 80 reduction by 2050 vs 1990 levels we benefited from the first year of operation of our third biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd scheme which provides an indexlinked price for the power produced until march 2027 the unit underwent a major planned outage between september and november with a full programme of works successfully completed the flexibility reliability and scale of our renewable generation alongside an attractive total system cost means we are strongly placed to play a longterm role in the uks energy mix to that end we continue to see longterm biomass generation as a key enabler allowing the uk government to meet its decarbonisation targets and the system operator to manage the grid the uk government recently confirmed support for further biomass generation at drax power station and we now plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  allowing us to provide even more renewable electricity whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer our heritage is coal but our future is flexible lowercarbon electricity we are making progress with the development of four new standalone ocgt plants situated in eastern england and wales and our work to develop options for coaltogas repowering with battery technologies  if these options would be supported by 15year capacity market contracts providing a clear investment signal and extending visibility of contractbased earnings out to the late 2030s in b2b energy supply we completed the acquisition of opus energy a supplier of electricity and gas to corporates and small businesses the transaction completed in february 2017 and opus energy has continued to operate successfully within the group achieving its targets and making an immediate and significant contribution to profitability alongside this good performance we have also implemented the operational steps necessary to realise further operational benefits of the acquisition and we now source all of opus power and gas internally haven power delivered a strong performance with the sale of large volumes of electricity to industrial customers through our customer focus and efficiencies margins have improved and the business generated a positive ebitda for the first time together our b2b energy supply business now has over 375000 customer meters making it the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk we are delivering innovative lowcarbon power solutions with 46 of our energy sold from renewable sources as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power we see this as a significant opportunity for the group in the medium to long term in october 2017 we completed the sale of billington bioenergy bbe to aggregated micro power holding amph consideration for the transaction was 23 million comprised of 16 million of shares in amph and 07 million of cash the sale of bbe is aligned with our strategy to focus on b2b energy supply however through our shareholding in amph we will retain an interest in the uk heating market whilst gaining exposure to the development of smallscale distributed energy assets political regulatory and economic background we continue to operate in a changing environment the full impact of the uks decision to leave the eu is still unknown the immediate impact on the group was a weakening of sterling and an associated increase in the cost of biomass which is generally denominated in other currencies through our utilisation of mediumterm foreign exchange hedges the group protected the cash impact of this weakness in 2017 sterling has generally strengthened and we have been able to extend our hedged position out to 2022 at rates close to those that we saw before brexit in terms of uk energy policy the governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts svt are not a common feature of the b2b market at the microbusiness end of this market which is closer in size to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are active in renewing contracts the uk governments response to its consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 has confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by october 2025 we believe our assets projects and ability to support our customers electricity management will support the governments ambition to maintain reliability when coal generation ceases running a resilient reliable grid is not simply about meeting the power demand on the system there are also system support services which are essential to its effective operation as the grid decentralises and becomes dependent on smaller distributed generation the number of plants able to provide these services is reducing biomass generation our proposed ocgts and our repowering project would allow us to meet these needs but this will not come for free a reliable flexible lowcarbon energy system will require the right longterm incentives in november 2017 the government confirmed that the uk will maintain a total carbon price the combined uk carbon price support  cps  and the european union emissions trading scheme  eu ets at around the current level cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing the level of carbon emissions in generation and we continue to support the pricing of carbon a view echoed in a report prepared for the uk government by the leading academic professor dieter helm against this backdrop we continue to make an important contribution to the uk economy according to a study published by oxford economics in 2016  draxs total economic impact  including our supply chain and the wages our employees and suppliers employees spend in the wider consumereconomy was 17 billion supporting 18500 jobs across the uk safety sustainability and people the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is vital to the group with safety at the centre of our operational philosophy we also recognise the growing need to support the wellbeing of our employees and their mental health during the year we continued to use total recordable injury rate trir as our primary kpi in this area performance was positive at 027 but we expect this to improve in the coming year the incident at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did not lead to physical injuries but was nonetheless a significant event and caused disruption into 2018 we consequently launched an incident investigation to ensure our personal and process safety management procedures are robust to promote greater awareness around wellbeing we have embedded this in our new people strategy and expect to focus more energy and resources on this important area during 2018 strong corporate governance is at the heart of the group  acting responsibly doing the right thing and being transparent as the group grows the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and recognising the importance of strong corporate governance  we have published a comprehensive overview of our sustainability progress in 2017 on our website  this also highlights future priorities to broaden our approach to sustainability and improved reporting of environment  social and governance esg performance we have also completed the process which allows us to participate in the un global compact ungc  an international framework which will guide our approach in the areas of human rights labour environment and anticorruption during 2017 we published our first statement on the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in compliance with the uk modern slavery act we have added modern slavery awareness to our programme of regular training for contract managers and reviewed our counterparty due diligence processes we have continued to maintain our rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability  ensuring the wood pellets we use are sustainable lowcarbon and fully compliant with the uks mandatory sustainability standards for biomass the biomass we use to generate electricity provides a 64

key asset of the business through 2017 we developed a new people strategy the strategy focuses on driving performance and developing talent to deliver the groups objectives we have established groupwide practices including a career development and behaviour framework focused on performance and personal development research and innovation a key part of our strategy is to identify opportunities to improve existing operations and create options for longterm growth to that end we have established a dedicated research and innovation ri team led by the drax engineers who delivered our worldfirst biomass generation and supply chain solution we are actively looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our operations notably in our biomass supply chain biomass is our largest

actively manage and reinvest in their forests  operational review safety remains our primary concern and we have delivered yearonyear reduction in the level of recordable incidents output at our amite and morehouse pellet plants increased significantly although was below our target for the year we have remained focused on opportunities to improve efficiencies and capture cost savings as part of our drive to produce good quality pellets at the lowest possible cost we still have more work to do in this area to optimise quality and cost as our performance was below target for the year as part of our plans to optimise and improve operations we added 150k tonnes capacity at our existing plants bringing total installed capacity to 11 million tonnes and increasing the amount of lower cost sawmill residues we are able to process and used in our pellets  case study lowcost highimpact capacity increase byproducts of higher value wood industries such as sawdust from sawmills offer a lowcost source of residues for use in our pellet production process and during 2017 we added an additional 150k tonnes of capacity at our pellet plants to allow us to use more of this material by investing in giant hydraulic platforms known as truck dumps operators at amite and morehouse can unload a 50foot truck carrying either sawdust or wood chips and weighing 60 tonnes in less than two minutes increasing

2016 63 million negative ebitda driven by increasing volumes of wood pellets produced and sold to the power generation business sales of pellets in the year ending 31 december 2017 totalled 136 million an increase of 84 over 2016 gross margin increased reflecting higher production volumes raw fibre procurement transportation and processing comprised the majority of cost of sales and as such this remains an important area of focus and an opportunity for the business through incremental investment in plant enhancements we expect to see further benefits from efficiencies and greater utilisation of lower cost residues total operating costs have increased reflecting an increase in operations at amite morehouse and the port of baton rouge alongside the addition of lasalle we

capacity as part of our selfsupply strategy performance review power generation drax power station remains the largest power station in the uk almost twice the size of the next largest during the year the station met 6 of the uks electricity needs whilst providing 15 of its renewable electricity alongside important system support services  with an increase in intermittent renewables and a reduction in the responsive thermal generation historically provided by coal  the system of the future will require capacity which is reliable flexible and able to respond quickly to changes in system demand and provide system support services these longterm needs inform our biomass generation and the development of options for investment in gas  open cycle gas turbines ocgts and coaltogas repowering  strategy in progress gas power station development we are developing options for four new ocgt gas power stations two of which already have planning permission and could be on the system in the early 2020s subject to being awarded a capacity agreement a hightech new control room at drax power station will allow engineers to have real time remote control of our ocgt assets via a fibreoptic cable network able to fire up from cold and produce power in minutes rather than hours  our ocgts will help maintain system security as intermittent renewable sources of power increase and older thermal

its clean growth plan  setting out its plans for delivery of its legally binding target to reduce 2050 carbon emissions by 80 versus 1990 levels across electricity generation heating and transport this reinforces the drax proposition  flexible reliable lowcarbon electricity in november the government updated its intentions regarding the future trajectory of uk carbon price support cps indicating that the total cost of carbon tax in the uk the total of cps and the eu emissions trading scheme would continue at around the current level  the tax is currently set at 18tonne  whilst coal remains on the system we believe that cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing carbon emissions from generation and that having an appropriate price for carbon emissions is the right way to provide a market signal to further reduce emissions in support of the uks longterm decarbonisation targets the uk government has now confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by 2025 we support this move subject to an appropriate alternative technology being in place with this in mind we have continued to develop options for our remaining coal assets to convert to biomass or gas to provide the reliable flexible capacity which we believe will be required to manage the increasingly volatile energy system of the future most recently with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply generation capacity and system support 2017 saw the first full year of operation of our biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd mechanism which provides indexlinked revenues for renewable electricity out to 2027 our other biomass units are supported by the renewable obligation certificate roc mechanism which similar to the cfd is also indexlinked to 2027 this acts as a premium above the price of power we sell from these units we sell power forward to the extent there is liquidity in the power markets which combined with our fuel hedging strategy provides longterm earnings and revenue visibility lower gas prices higher carbon costs and the continued penetration of intermittent renewables have kept wholesale electricity prices subdued with increasing levels of intermittent renewables we are continuing to see opportunities to extract value from flexibility  shortterm power and balancing market activity the provision of ancillary services and the value achieved from outofspecification fuels  to capture value in this market we continue to focus resource on optimising availability and flexibility of both coal and biomass units this whole process requires a high level of teamwork between the operational and commercial teams across the group to capture and protect value over the period 2017 to 2022 we expect to earn 90 million from a series of oneyear capacity market contracts for our coal units demonstrating that they still have a role to play the first of these contracts commenced in october 2017 adding 3 million to ebitda lastly we continue to source attractively priced fuel cargoes  outofspecification coals and distressed cargoes which help keep costs down for the business and consumers we do this for both coal and biomass this is a good example of how our commercial and operational teams work together to identify opportunities to create value for the business as these fuels typically require more complex handling processes you can follow the market and see prices at electricinsightscouk strategy in progress repowering away from coal options for drax power station to operate into the late 2030s and beyond moved up a gear in 2017 with the development of an option to repower two coal units to gas drax gave notice of the nationally significant infrastructure project to the planning inspectorate in september 2017 one of the units could be eligible for the capacity market auction planned for december 2019 local community consultations began in november 2017 and continued in february 2018 on options including up to 36gw of new gas generation capacity a gas pipeline and 200mw of battery storage in line with government plans to end noncompliant coal generation by 2025 and drax groups strategy of playing a vital role in the future energy system find out more repowerdraxcom operational review overall we delivered a good performance during 2017 and maintained a strong safety performance we completed a major planned outage on the unit supported by the cfd contract this unit provides stable and reliable baseload renewable electricity to the network and longterm earnings visibility for the group the safe and efficient completion of these complex works is a credit to those involved and reflects our continued focus on opportunities for improvement and efficiencies the entire organisation has responded to a number of challenging unplanned events most notably in december we experienced a fire on a section of conveyor at our biomass rail unloading facility and consequently an unplanned outage from late december 2017 to midjanuary 2018 following investigation and recommissioning the facility has returned to service with enhanced operating procedures although this issue did not relate to the operation of the biomassgenerating units the resulting restriction on fuel deliveries by rail required the optimisation of generation across our biomass units resulting in lower ebitda and full year biomass availability than our target for the year financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 238 million 2016 174 million principally due to the cfd mechanism value from flexibility was below our target for the year principally reflecting a lower level of ancillary service payments versus 2016 our operational performance drives the results the financial impact of the unplanned outage on the rail unloading facility was mitigated by optimisation of our available biomass and the use of additional generation capacity retained for selfinsurance purposes however this incident is a reminder of the need to invest appropriately to maintain a high level of operational availability and flexibility at

generation to exploit our strengths and create opportunities for the long term to that end we will continue to develop options for gas and pursue efficiencies through our biomass supply chain performance review b2b energy supply our b2b energy supply business  comprised of opus energy and haven power  is the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power the key factors influencing our business are regulation competition and our operational performance regulation and competition the uk governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts the government will take forward legislation which will provide the regulator ofgem with the authority to cap these domestic tariffs svts are not a feature of our business our focus remains on the b2b market at the microbusiness end of the market which is closer in proximity to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are actively rather than passively renewing their power supply contracts the b2b market remains competitive with 65 different suppliers across the market our haven power and opus energy businesses offer customercentric power gas and services we offer simplicity and flexibility across our products and actively engage with customers to help them manage their energy requirements and reduce carbon emissions strategy in progress an innovative energy supplier 90 of the electricity that opus energy supplied last year came from clean renewable sources at no extra cost to their predominantly small and mediumsized business customers for those customers who want it 100 renewable energy contracts are also available  this was exactly what all saints church in ascot was looking for to power their business assistant church warden chris gunton commented we wanted to move to a greener energy supplier without paying a premium so approached an energy broker for guidance they advised us that opus energy were a reliable company with a good reputation and when we asked for a quote they were the most competitive it was a similar story for the salisbury museum in wiltshire nicola kilgourcroft finance manager said we were looking for an energy supplier that offered great value combined with the right length of contract and good ethics opus energy ticked all these boxes for us alongside supplying customers opus energy has power purchase agreements with over 2300 independent uk renewable energy generators these could be anything from a single wind turbine owned by a village community  to europes greenest zoo hamerton zoo park commented andrew swales director of hamerton zoo working with opus energy has given us competitive prices considerably better documentation and a highly efficient service wed happily recommend them operational review we have remained focused on delivering an excellent standard of customer service which is central to our proposition february 2017 saw the completion of the acquisition of opus energy which has made good progress integrating into the group supported by a dedicated team who have been working on systems people and commercial projects to ensure our processes work effectively together in march we completed the purchase of a new office facility in northampton  enabling the consolidation of four opus energy offices into one and the centralisation of the operational teams sales volumes at opus energy were lower than target reflecting our focus on margin which has remained strong and customer renewal rates were towards the high end of expectation this reflects the continued commitment to a strong level of customer service and in recognition of this opus energy was awarded utility provider to small businesses of the year 2017 at the british business awards  at haven power we have continued to focus on valueadding flexible products and services particularly to industrial  commercial customers whose needs extend beyond commodity supply this is demonstrated through our ability to help customers manage and optimise their power consumption profiles through collaboration with our carefully selected partners through better systems and services customer targeting and a keener focus on cost to serve we are driving efficiencies and improved margin at haven power following the acquisition of opus energy the major enterprise resource platform erp system upgrade was replanned which has led to a revised timeline from q2 2018 onwards we continue to actively manage credit risk by assessing the financial strength of customers and applying rigorous credit management processes with a strong focus continuing to be placed on billing and cash collection health and safety remains an area of focus for the business and we continue to target a reduction in the level of recordable incidents financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 29 million in line with our guidance 2016 4 million negative this was principally due to the acquisition of opus energy which added 10 months of ebitda but also improved financial performance from haven power which was ahead of plan third party costs tpcs include grid charges the cost of meeting our obligations under the renewable obligation ro and smallscale feedintariff schemes grid charges include distribution transmission and system balancing costs tpcs have continued to increase and now account for 50 of revenue
