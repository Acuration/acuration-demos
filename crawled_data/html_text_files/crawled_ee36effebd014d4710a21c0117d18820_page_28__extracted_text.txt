national effort by publishing clear and simple advice for customers where possible they should have specialist teams dedicated to supporting customers if they are having problems such as those facing repayment difficulties and vulnerable customers as rbs has done this could include prioritising those customers who are isolated and vulnerable ensuring they do not become disconnected and can easily

a successful beccs pilot at its power station beccs is the only negative emissions technology which can produce renewable electricity whilst removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by using beccs drax will remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces creating a negative carbon footprint for the company by 2030 drax launched the zero carbon humber campaign last year with partners equinor and national grid ventures aimed at creating the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster in the region by using beccs drax could capture and store 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year and become the anchor for a net zero industrial cluster in the humber region as part of its global leadership in addressing the climate crisis the uk government is developing a policy and investment framework to support urgently needed negative emissions technologies like beccs the uk committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero photo caption innovation engineer inspecting carbon

of corporate affairs clare harbords speech to the british chambers of commerce 5 march 2020 press releases thank you very much its a pleasure to be here again we meet today in extraordinary times britain is forging a new relationship with countries around the world following our departure from the eu the climate emergency is gathering pace with unprecedented weather conditions facing people and business across the country including on our doorstep at drax power station in yorkshire and now we have the coronavirus  which risks unleashing a medical emergency right around the globe and has already wiped billions off global stock markets 2020 is set to be a challenging year for british businesses up and down the country but it will also we believe be a pivotal year for britain in achieving its net zero emissions targets despite all of the challenges we face  this is a year of great opportunity for british business to take the lead in tackling the climate crisis and build a zerocarbon economy last week in a landmark move for britains energy transition drax announced that we would stop using coal to generate power after nearly 50 years we will do so 4 years ahead of the current government deadline of 2025 for generations drax has been at the heart of britains energy system we are a strategic national asset supplying secure reliable power to more than six million homes and businesses in the north but we understood a long time ago that coal no longer had a place in our energy system so we have embarked on the biggest decarbonisation journey in europe  transforming the majority of our power station at drax from coal to sustainably sourced renewable biomass  weve cut our carbon emissions by more than 85  further and faster than any other energy company in europe today more than 90 of the power generated by drax is renewable  allowing businesses like yours to choose power that is both reliable and renewable but at drax we wont stop there we want to go further thats why we announced our ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  in fact drax was the first company in the world to announce this ambition at the un climate change conference in madrid last year since then microsoft  and many others  have followed us with similar pledges let me tell you how we will get there we are using pioneering british technology to capture carbon from bioenergy in doing so we are taking carbon out of the atmosphere and creating negative emissions today we are already capturing one tonne of carbon per day but with the right investment we could be capturing up to 16 million tonnes every year think of that  negative emissions on a huge scale the un and committee on climate change tell us negative emissions will be vital if the uk is to reach net zero emissions by 2050 this is an exciting opportunity for drax and the uk and it is also a huge opportunity for british businesses and communities in the north too at drax we are working with businesses from around the country to explore how to use carbon in new ways were working with econic  a cleantech company  to remove oil from plastic production were working with deep branch bio to create proteins that feed animals and plants and were having discussions with airlines and heathrow about decarbonising the aviation industry with renewable jet fuel scaling up our carbon capture project will help the uks biggest industrialists in the humber reduce their emissions and continue to prosper a zero carbon humber by 2040  that is our vision this would transform the economic outlook of the region which already contributes 18bn towards the uk economy each year and supports over 55000 manufacturing jobs alone by decarbonising the region we will protect the businesses that form part of the supply chain for energy intensive industries as well as establishing new ones not since the first industrial revolution has the humber had this world leading opportunity our vision is to put the humber  the uks most carbon intensive industrial region  back on the global stage as an example to the rest of the world of climate leadership in action creating green jobs and clean growth we are working with academics at leading universities who are helping to create new businesses new innovations and new products through forging these partnerships we can protect and grow new supply chains to support the green economy next week the chancellor is due to deliver his first budget this is the first major opportunity for government to demonstrate its commitment to levelling up the economy by investing in infrastructure in the north and tackling the climate emergency our message to the chancellor is clear  support for the zero carbon humber project will help secure the future of our biggest industrial cluster and put the uk on the map as a global leader in the fight against climate change at the heart of our ambition to decarbonise the humber are jobs and businesses we must ensure people are equipped with the skills they need for the green jobs of the future thats why we are spearheading a zero carbon skills taskforce which will bring together employers government unions academia and others to ensure that the journey to net zero provides jobs for the future right now the future seems challenging and uncertain but at drax we are optimistic we know that with the right support we can meet our climate targets and boost our economy at the same time we can help build workforces that are equipped to meet the demands of a green economy by boosting skills and opportunity and as britain seeks to secure its place in the world  we can seize the opportunities of infrastructure and new technology investment that will put our country and our businesses at the heart of a global green economy thank you drax urges uk to seize the opportunities to build a zero carbon economy press releases speaking at the british chamber of commerce annual conference in london on
