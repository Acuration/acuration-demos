power station transporting carbon  how to safely move co 2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage transporting captured co 2 in pipes may be a new idea for the uk but the science and experience is there to ensure its safe 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach its climate goals its just a matter of
