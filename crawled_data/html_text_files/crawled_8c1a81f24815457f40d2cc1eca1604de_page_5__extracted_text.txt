big cleanup 26 june 2020 electrification on the eve of the new f1 season the motor sport faces an existential dilemma while the covid19 pandemic has inflicted huge uncertainty throughout 2020 environmental concerns continue to question its longterm viability the australian grand prix in melbourne has long been the curtainraiser to eight months of gasguzzling decibeldeafening action on racetracks across the globe contributing to a carbon footprint of 256551 tonnes due to the season being delayed the first race will now take place in austria but the focus on australia has been sharpened by the new year bushfires  visible evidence say some scientists and environmentalists of the climate crisis this adds fuel to the fiery debate on formula ones perceived failure to take its environmental responsibilities seriously koala bear on eucalyptus branch escaping from australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020 significantly it is not the cars doing 70 laps that generate most of f1s

a genuine shift in attitudes about to descend on the circuits of monaco silverstone and interlagos firstly a raft of countries have announced plans to phase out petrol and dieselpowered engines between 2030 and 2050  this could force the hand of motorsport bosses who have long been accused of talking a good game but failing to act the sport recently announced a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030 and in pursuit of this goal it is looking to introduce twostroke engines that run on synthetic fuel by the mid2020s while current f1 hybrid engines will be replaced by a new specification of power unit from 2025 or 2026 max verstappen formula one driver currently under article 1944 of the fias 2019 technical regulation for f1 a minimum of 575 of the fuel must comprise biocomponents the sport wants to reach 100 aiming for 10 in 2021 and a gradual subsequent increase such developments could potentially seize upon the opportunities offered by companies pioneering the use of carbon capture use and storage ccus  such as drax one of several ideas discussed to make the sport more sustainable has been capturing carbon that is then mixed with hydrogen from water to form liquid fuel such technology is in development and drax is researching how carbon dioxide co 2  can be used to produce fuels its innovation engineers recently met with velocys the fuels technology company which plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the humber could f1 go electric while greener fuels are the most obvious way forward there have been calls for alternative forms of energy to be used to power f1 cars a hydrogen solution could be developed quickly but it would significantly increase the bulkiness and weight of cars but what about electric formula one race car electric power is attractive but its currently still quite difficult to scale that up pat symonds chief technical officer at formula one said in an interview  with any of the technologies on the horizon at the moment an electric truck or an electric aircraft is not a particularly feasible product so there is still a case for having liquid hydrocarbon fuels in trucks and in aircraft however what we cannot do is carry on digging those out of the ground were going to have to somehow synthesise them and thats what we want formula 1 to explore and hopefully to lead formula e set to challenge f1 dominance another driver of change looming larger in formula ones rearview mirror is formula e while this fledgling sports claim to quieter cars may not appeal to the most hardened of petrolhead f1 fans its credible narrative of boosting sustainability in each of the 12 cities that host its races is always a potential attraction to new generations of increasingly climate conscious young fans take formula es opening race in riyadh saudi arabia the countrys most polluted city the sport is a beneficiary of the kingdoms aim to reduce its reliance oil and in the last six years the middle eastern country has invested over 350 billion in renewable energy projects mainly solar and wind saudi arabia formula e grand prix credit courtesy of formula e as with all electric cars there are challenges excess heat produced by electric motors is offset by reducing the performance of the car when it is too hot a series of cooling systems using radiators and fluid in closed loops regulate temperatures to a satisfactory level appealing to fans is critical for the sports prosperity sustainability credentials are a key strand but formula e is going beyond that and looking to optimise raceday experience through features such as fanboost this is an online voting system where the three drivers voted as fans favourites get a five second power boost of 100kj which can provide serious assistance when a car overtakes maybe this is just one innovation that f1 could learn from its much younger counterpart perhaps there is also a case for taking the best of what both have to offer  the cities the cars

british trade its also been instrumental in how the country is powered historically providing an abundant source of oil and natural gas however this cold fringe off the north atlantic could also play a vital role in decarbonising the uks economy  not because of its full oil and gas reservoirs but thanks to its empty ones in an effort to limit or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co 2  in the atmosphere countries around the world are rushing towards large scale carbon capture usage and storage projects ccus in this process co 2 is captured from sources such as energy production and manufacturing or directly removed from the air and reused or stored permanently  for example underground in disused oil and gas reservoirs or other suitable geological formations source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload the international energy agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius yet the global ccs institute reports that as of 2019 the projects currently in operation or under construction had the capacity to capture and store only 40 million tonnes of co 2 per year its clear the global capacity for ccus must accelerate rapidly in the coming decade but it raises the questions where can these millions of tonnes of co 2 be stored and what happens to it once it is where can you store co 2  the most welldeveloped approach to storing co 2 is injecting it underground into naturally occurring porous rock formations such as former natural gas or oil reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers these are deep geological formations with deposits of very salty water present in the rocks pores and most commonly found under the ocean the north sea and the area off the us gulf coast contain several saline aquifers once co 2 has been captured using ccus technology  its pressurised and turned into a liquidlike form known as supercritical co 2  from there its transported via pipeline and injected into the rocks found in the formations deep below the earths surface this is a process called geological sequestration source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload but while pumping co 2 into the ground is one thing ensuring it stays there and isnt released into the atmosphere is another fortunately there are several ways to ensure co 2 is stored safely and securely keeping the lid on co 2 stored underground put simply the most straightforward way underground reservoirs store co 2 is through the solid impermeable rock that typically surrounds them once co 2 is injected into a reservoir it slowly moves upwards through the reservoir until it meets this layer of impermeable rock which acts like a lid the co 2 cannot pass through this is whats referred to as structural storage and is the same mechanism that has kept oil and gas locked underground for millions of years white chalk stone over time the co 2 trapped in reservoirs will often begin to chemically react with the minerals of the surrounding rock the elements bind to create solid chalky minerals essentially locking the co 2 into the rock in a process called mineral storage in the case of saline aquifers as well as structural and mineral storage the co 2 can dissolve into the salty water in a process called dissolution storage here the dissolved co 2 slowly descends to the bottom of the aquifer in any given reservoir each or all of these processes work to store co 2 indefinitely and while there remains some possibility of co 2 leakage from a site research suggests it will be minimal one study published in the journal nature suggests more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years storage for the net zero future in the united states industrial scale storage is in action in texas wyoming oklahoma and illinois and there are projects in progress across the united arab emirates australia algeria and canada however there is still a long way to go for ccus to reach the scale it needed to limit the effects of climate change research has shown that globally there is an abundance of co 2 storage sites which could support widespread ccus adoption a report compiled by researchers at imperial college london and e4tech and published by drax details an estimated 70 billion tonnes of storage capacity in the uk alone the us on the other hand has an estimated storage capacity of 10 trillion tonnes its clear the capacity for storage is present it now remains the task of governments and companies to ramp up ccus projects to begin to reach the scale necessary in the uk drax power station is piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage projects beccs which could see it becoming the worlds first negative emissions power station as part of the zero carbon humber partnership it could also form a part of the worlds first zero carbon industrial hub in the north of the uk such projects are indicative of the big ambitions ccus technology could realise  not just decarbonising single sites but capturing and storing co 2 from entire industries and regions there is still a way to go to meet that ambition

expectations for 2020 adjusted ebitda are currently in line with consensus inclusive of an estimated potential impact from covid19 of 60 million principally in relation to its customers business full year expectations for the group remain underpinned by good operational availability for the remainder of 2020 in the customers business the consequences of covid19 are only now starting to become visible it is expected to result in reduced demand and a potential increase in bad debt which represents a major sensitivity particularly in the sme 4 market as a result drax has significantly increased its expectation of potential customer business failures and higher bad debt assuming the continued impact of covid19 throughout 2020 drax now expects a full year adjusted ebitda loss for the customers business the group will closely monitor the impact on the customers business and update the market accordingly in generation the groups expectations for the full year reflect a reduction in roc recycle prices resulting from reduced power demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio the performance of the generation business is dependent on the continuation of biomass deliveries to drax power station biomass generation is currently the most material area of activity for the group and a protracted suspension of the supply chain could lead to lower levels of biomass generation resulting in a reduction in the groups expectations for the full year at present there has been no impact from covid19 and the group has a good supply of biomass throughout the supply chain which continues to be robust and functioning well engineer climbs cooling tower at drax power station click to viewdownload generation during the first three months of 2020 draxs generation portfolio performed well with good asset availability and optimisation of generation underpinning a strong financial performance the business benefits from a strong forward power sales position through 2022 which combined with indexlinked renewable schemes and capacity payments provides a high level of earnings visibility helping to protect the business from the current weakness in uk power prices in response to covid19 drax has implemented robust business continuity procedures across its sites to protect employees and contractors and ensure continued operation in addition to operating strategically important infrastructure the components of the groups uk supply chain are considered key sectors allowing continued

has performed well in the first three months of 2020 whilst covid19 has not had any measurable impact on biomass generation to date a sustained reduction in electricity demand could result in a reduction in roc recycle prices in the current compliance period the group has adjusted its expectations for the full year but the precise impact will be dependent on the depth and duration of any reduction in demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio engineer at cruachan power station click to viewdownload the groups hydro assets have performed well particularly the pumped storage business primarily driven by activity in the system support services market as previously disclosed cruachan pumped storage power station was successful in a tender process run by the system operator to procure inertia and reactive power services the contract is worth up to c5 million per year over six years and is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2020 this was the first tender of its kind and reflects the growing importance of system support services as the generation market becomes increasingly supplied by intermittent renewable power sources the system operator is expected to conduct further tenders over the coming year thermal generation is performing in line with draxs expectations pellet production lasalle bioenergy wood pellet manufacturing plant in louisiana click to viewdownload pellet production has performed well in the first three months of 2020 at present there has been no disruption to production caused by covid19 although the state of louisiana is experiencing a high number of cases the semiautomated nature of the pellet production process limits the need for individuals to be in contact with each other and this has been enhanced by robust business continuity procedures to further reduce the risk to employees and contractors drax continues to monitor developments closely and notes that energy rail port and forestry are designated key sectors in the usa allowing continued operation customers the groups customers business which sells power gas and energy services to the ic 6 and sme markets has seen a significant reduction in demand as a result of covid19 the group has been working to assess the potential impact of this demand reduction the increased risk of business failure and bad debt the impact is expected to be most pronounced in the sme market which represents c30 percent of monthly billing the impact is expected to be partially mitigated by credit insurance in respect of certain customers balance sheet at 31 december 2019 drax had 404 million of cash which increased to 454 million at 31 march 2020 the groups plan for 2020 included capital investment of 230250 million with half of this assigned to strategic investment in biomass expansion and cost reduction whilst the group continues to see its biomass strategy as both a primary long and shortterm source of value drax is reviewing the timing of its investment programme in 2020 and in the shortterm investment is expected to be lower at 31 march 2020 net debt had reduced to 818m million and drax continues to target around 2 x net debt to ebitda for the full year the group has available cash and committed facilities of 663 million including a cash line available within a 315 million revolving credit facility rcf which is currently undrawn and matures in april 2021 the group has an esg facility with final maturity in 2022 and a 350m sterling bond which matures in 2022 the group has a further 500 million fixed rate usd bond maturing in 2025 and infrastructure private placement loans maturing through 20242029 the groups facilities include a

rolling fiveyear foreign exchange hedge book continues to provide protection from the recent weakness in sterling to 2025 the group actively manages risk limits with counterparties providing forward foreign exchange contracts and the current weakness in sterling has led to the rebasing of a number of contracts resulting in the acceleration of cash flows from these contracts to the benefit of drax

net zero  heres why 7 april 2020 carbon capture reaching the uks target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate

capture carbon capture use and storage ccus is a vital technology in the energy industry with facilities already in place all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide co 2  emissions however for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2 o c  as per the paris climate agreement  emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy from cement factories to farmland ccus technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world construction the global population is increasingly urban and by 2050 its estimated 68 of all people will live in cities  for cities to grow sustainably its crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced construction currently accounts for 11 of all global carbon emissions  this includes emissions from the actual construction work such as from vehicle exhaust pipes but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials steel and concrete are emissionsheavy to make they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions deploying widespread ccus in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment steel manufacturing alone regardless of the electricity used to power production is responsible for about 7 of global emissions  projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in europe and are already in motion in the united arab emirates abu dhabi national oil company and masdar a renewable energy and sustainability company formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercialscale ccus projects in its project with emirates steel which began in 2016 about 800000 tonnes of co 2 is captured a year from the steel manufacturing plant this is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery eor the commercially selfsustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrialscale projects in the region cement manufacturing a process that produces as much as 8 of global greenhouse gases  is also experiencing the growth of innovative ccus projects norcem cement plant in brevik norway has already begun experimenting with ccus calculating that it could capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year and store it under the north sea if the project wins government approval norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023 however as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it a team at massachusetts institute of technology is exploring a new method of cement production that is more ccus friendly  by pretreating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process the co 2 produced is released in a pure concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products such as fizzy drinks agriculture its hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry as well as feeding the world it employs a third of it  within this sector fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply however the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2 of global co 2 emissions ccus technology can reduce the co 2 contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser while maintaining crop reliability in 2019 oil and gas climate initiatives ogci climate investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest ccus project in the us based at the wabash valley resources fertiliser plant in indiana  the project will capture between 13 and 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the ammonia producer per year the captured carbon will then be stored 2000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer similarly since the turn of the millennium mitsubishi heavy industries engineering has deployed ccus technology at fertiliser plants around asia  co 2 is captured from natural gas precombustion and used to create the urea fertiliser however the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more naturebased and cheaper ways soil acts as a carbon sink capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it however intensive ploughing can damage the soils ability to retain co 2  it only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques like minimising soil disturbance or crop and grazing rotations to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of co 2 and even make farms carbon negative  transport the transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions according to the world health organisation electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sectors decarbonisation however at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads there are other essential modes of transport where ccus has a role to play climeworks a swiss company developing units that capture co 2 directly from the air has begun working with rotterdam the hague airport to develop a direct air capture dac unit on the airports grounds climeworks plant technology source climeworks photo by julia dunlop hydrogen filling station in hamburg germany however beyond just capturing co 2 from planes taking off climeworks aims to use the co 2 to produce a synthetic jet fuel  creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere a pilot project aims to create 1000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021 another approach to zerocarbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen which is already powering cars trains buses and even spacecraft  hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways but its predominantly created from natural gas through a process in which co 2 is a byproduct ccus can play an important role here in capturing the co 2 and storing it  preventing it entering the atmosphere the hydrogenpowered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat from every industry to every business to everyone as ccus technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites to entire economic regions global thermostat is developing dac technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes the system uses the waste heat to power a dac unit either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere such technologies along with those already in action like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  can quickly make negative emissions a reality at scale  however to capture transport and permanently store co 2 at the scale needed to reach net zero collaboration partnerships and shared infrastructure between businesses in industrial regions is essential the uks humber region is an example of an industrial cluster where a large number of highcarbon industrial sites sit in close proximity to one another by installing beccs and ccus infrastructure that can be utilised by multiple industries the uk can have a far greater impact on emissions levels than through individual smallscale ccus projects decarbonising the uk and the world will not be achieved by individual sites and industries but by collective action that transcends sectors regions and supply chains

they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the

we believe more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of uk workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable flexible and low carbon power for 13 million british homes but as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down we cant stand still so today i am pleased to share our new ambition to move beyond carbon neutrality to achieve something that nobody has before and become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030  by applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce while continuing to produce about 5 of the uks overall electricity needs as the ipcc and uk governments committee on climate change make clear  negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earths temperature rise to 15 degrees  at drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal if we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind the uk is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way we are second to none in deploying renewables like offshore wind and bioenergy  which have transformed lives and our postindustrial communities we need to apply a similar framework to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as made offshore wind so successful fundamentally an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical the government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime with confidence in that regulatory framework many businesses provided investment and innovation as a result offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts mw of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8000 mw in 2018  an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 75 of the uks electricity at the same time the cost of that electricity has declined from 114mwh in 2015 to 39mwh in 2019 the latter being a cost that will make offshore wind viable without subsidy with government support and an effective regulatory regime to give the private sector the confidence to invest and innovate bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will trace that same path at the same time investing in this technology will both save lots of existing jobs and create many next generation green technology jobs that is why we have founded along with equinor and national grid zero carbon humber  to work with the government to bring carbon capture and storage infrastructure to the northeast of the uk we can save 55000 existing heavy industry jobs while capturing as much as 30 million tons of co 2 per year at the same time we will create a new industry and also the infrastructure for a new hydrogen economy to take our decarbonisation further by creating the right conditions for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to flourish britain can continue to benefit  socially economically and environmentally from being at the vanguard of the fight against climate change and at the same time it is our ambition at drax to play a major role in that fight by becoming the first carbon negative company thank you
