peoplepowered renewables revolution in the future could families and firms power themselves 24 august 2017 sustainable business for decades the electricity system was relatively straightforward power was generated by utility companies then sold and supplied to consumers and businesses but this is changing and the power industry may be on the verge of a revolution the falling costs and ongoing innovation around technologies like rooftop solar panels and domestic battery storage is enabling the rise of socalled prosumers  individuals businesses or institutions who not only consume electricity but produce it too according to the national grids 2017 future energy scenarios report this could lead to an almost entirely decentralised cleaner energy system but for this to happen prosumerism needs to be adopted at scale and this relies on technological innovation and changes to attitudes and behaviours the technology powering prosumers the biggest barrier to largescale adoption of prosumerism is technology although research and innovation pounds dollars and euros have been pouring into the technologies that make decentralised power generation possible there are still developments to be made solar is one of the most prominently used renewables by prosumers thanks to the relative affordability of rooftop solar systems even homeinterior giant ikea now offers solar panels and battery systems through a partnership with the uks largest solar company solarcentury but like wind turbines a more costprohibitive solution solar is an intermittent energy source which means domestic users may still need to access the grid to fill gaps in their own generation that is unless battery technology advances to a point where it can store enough solar or windgenerated electricity to fully power homes and businesses affordably  allyear round including in the dark still days of midwinter until then a prosumer who wants to have a reliable flexible selfsupply of energy needs to be able to call on a mix of renewable technologies  just as the national system does hamerton zoo in cambridgeshire for example generates its own energy via a mix of solar wind and biomass it then sells its excess electricity to an energy supplier there are signs that battery technology is starting to take off as an option for powering homes and businesses teslas powerwall is currently the closest home battery system to breaking through to mainstream consumers and many firms are following its lead for example in the uk elon musks company faces new competition from nissan which is partnering with us power firm eaton to build and sell home batteries in the uk  that two electric car manufacturers are in on the act is no surprise  it will be another revolution that of electric vehicles evs usurping the dominance of petrol and diesel models that is set to bring the boon that batteries need to become a popular choice for prosumers the government is also pushing innovation in the space with business and energy secretary greg clark announcing plans to invest 264 million into research in the sector over the next four years energy ownership but what could this mean for the business of electricity the national grid report suggests multiple commercial models will operate together to facilitate a decentralised prosumerbased energy system these would include homes and businesses who wholly own their energy systems as well as systems owned and operated by third parties such as aggregators managing energy or solarrental schemes communityowned projects could also play a role with small renewable energy facilities supplying residents such as the wind turbine in the cambridgeshire village of gamlingay  excess energy could also be sold back to the grid with any money earned reinvested in the community or in its renewable infrastructure similar schemes are already in place in both the business and consumer retail markets in 2016 for example opus energy  a drax group company supplying energy to uk businesses  bought almost 1 twh of power from over 2000 small renewable generators who use technologies such as anaerobic digestion solar onshore wind and hydro  opus energy then sells that power onto its predominantly small and mediumsized enterprise sme customer base this allows it to offer innovative tariffs such as the 100 solar power deal enjoyed by restaurant chain leon this summer haven power the drax retail business specialising in electricity supply for large corporate and industrial clients sells on power from over 20 small renewable generators  and it has a number of large clients such as water utilities who selfgenerate a lot of their own power and work with haven power to help manage their selfsupply against their demand from regional electricity distribution networks and further upstream national grid and power stations for large power generators an increase in prosumerism in the energy sector could mean likely overall demand may decrease which would mean a scaling back of operations however the increased volatility of the grid will give rise to the need for flexibility and for additional ancillary services like frequency response which ensures the countrys electricity is all operating at the same frequency this would most likely be delivered by flexible generators such as gas and biomass which would also be required for winter demand when more electricity is required and there is less wind and solar generation the role of government incentives another key part of the rise of consumer generated power will be government regulation and incentive schemes in the uk new measures have been put in place to encourage individuals to generate their own electricity  these intend to make it easier for prosumers to generate their own power through solar store it in batteries and sell it back to the national grid something which regulator ofgem claims could save consumers between 17 billion and 40 billion by 2050  this isnt the only scheme of its kind currently in action the uks renewable heat incentive rhi encourages homeowners and businesses to adopt lowcarbon heating offering to pay a certain amount for every kwh of renewable heat generated feedin tariffs on the other hand also offer financial incentives  with electricity suppliers paying prosumers for the energy they produce themselves is my home or business big enough the prosumer revolution will not happen overnight selfgeneration and selfstorage of power and the installation of renewable heat systems are more suited to larger properties or those linked up to communitybased projects so for many people living in properties they own rent or in social housing the idea of becoming a prosumer could right now be a little farfetched and although there is evidence that the national transmission grid is already decentralising nor will this revolution mean the complete eradication of all centralised utilities through gradual improvements in smallscale energy generation power storage smart technology and government policies it will become an increasingly affordable and efficient way for communities businesses and institutions to go green share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable bioenergy forests net zero and the science behind biomass
