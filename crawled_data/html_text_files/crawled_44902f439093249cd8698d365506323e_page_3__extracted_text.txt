were not talking about battery life but the overall lifetime of the items we use every day that are powered by electricity its accepted that todays electrical devices have short life spans in part a symptom of rapidly evolving technology fuelling the need for constant consumer updates and in part a result of planned obsolescence devices being manufactured to fail within a set number of years to encourage repeat purchases electrical devices arent purchased with the belief they will last a lifetime but it hasnt always been this way before rapid technological development and the rise of fast consumerism devices were built to last over the relatively short history of electrical appliances there are tools and equipment that have operated for decades some of these remain in operation today with hardly any alterations but for a few tweaks here and there to upgrade or preserve built to last here are a few of the longest running electrical inventions the oxford electric bell located in the clarendon laboratory university of oxford 1840  the oxford electric bell the oxford electric bell is not your typical bell  not just in how it looks but in the fact it has been in constant operation since the mid 19 th century it consists of two primitive batteries called dry piles with bells fitted at each end and a metal ball that vibrates between them to very quietly continuously ring its original purpose is unidentified but what is known is that the bell is the result of an experiment put on by the london instrumentmanufacturing firm watkins and hill in 1840 acquired by robert walker a physics professor at the university of oxford in the mid 1800s its displayed at oxfords clarendon laboratory which explains why its also known as the clarendon pile the exact makeup of the dry piles is unknown as no one wants to tamper with them to investigate their composition out for fear of ending the bells 179yearlong streak as a result confusion remains as to why the oxford electric bell has remained in operation for so long souter lighthouse tyneside england 1871  souter lighthouse in south shields uk the lamp in the souter lighthouse  situated between the rivers tyne and wear was the most advanced of its day when it was first constructed designed to use an alternating electric current it was the first purposebuilt electrically powered lighthouse in the world although no longer in operation today it ran unchanged for nearly 50 years the light was generated using carbon arc lamps  and it originally produced a beam of red light that would come on once every five seconds souters original lamp operated unchanged from 1871 to 1914 when it was replaced by more conventional oil lamps it was altered again to run on mains electric power in 1952 and was finally deactivated in 1988 1896  the isle of mans manx electric railway tourism hit the isle of man in the 1880s and with it came the construction of hotels and boarding houses two businessmen saw this as an opportunity to purchase a large estate on the island and develop it into housing and a pleasure development the manx parliament approved the sale in 1892 on one condition that a road and a tramway be built to give people access snaefell mountain railway station isle of man it was decided that the tram would be electric and work began in the spring of 1893 with the tram system up and running by september of that year although the track and its cars have been extended and updated over time the first three cars remain the longest running electric tramcars in the world  photograph by dick jones centennialbulborg 1902  the centennial bulb the unassuming centennial bulb has been working in the livermore california fire department for 117 years the bulb was first installed in 1902 in the departments hose cart house but was later moved to livermores fire station 6 where it has been illuminated for more than a million hours throughout its life the centennial bulb has seen just two interruptions for a week in 1937 when the firehouse was refurbished and in may 2013 when it was off for nine and a half hours due to a failed power supply made by the shelby electric company the handblown bulb previously shone at 60 watts but has since been dimmed to 4 watts while this means it isnt able to actually illuminate much it is a reminder that despite the disposable nature of many modern electrical devices its possible to build electrical items that last tags electricity  electricity generation  railways and trains  technology  transport 5 exciting energy innovations that you should know about in 2020 5 june 2020 power generation as we head into the 2020s  its an exciting time for energy a deeper level of climate consciousness has led to crucial changes in populations attitudes and thinking around how we power our lives  adapting to a new set of energy standards has become essential its also driving innovation in energy technology leading to the rise of a number of emerging technologies designed to support the global energy transition in new ways from domestic solar and wind generation to leaps forward in recycling and aeroplane fuel here are five new energy ideas in the 2020s pipeline miniature turbines for your garden think of a wind farm and you might think of giant structures located in remote windswept areas but thats quickly changing icewind is developing residential wind turbines that use the same generatorprincipal as largescale wind farms just on a much smaller scale a set of three outer and three inner vertical blades rotate when the wind passes through them providing spinning mechanical energy that passes through the generator and is converted to electricity constructed from durable stainless steel carbon fibre and aluminium the cw1000 model can handle wind speeds of up to 134 miles per hour to ensure theyre fit for domestic use the units are adapted to have a maximum height of just over 3 metres and make less than 40 decibels of noise  roughly equivalent to quiet conversation the icelandic company says it aims to decentralise and democratise energy generation by making wind power accessible to people anywhere in the world expanding solar to cover more surfaces as solar technology becomes more widespread and easier to implement more communities are turning to a prosumer approach and generating their own power roof panels to date have been the most common way to domestically capture and convert rays but solecco is taking it a step further offering solar roof tiles these work in the same way as roof panels using photovoltaic cells made of silicon to convert sunlight into electricity but by covering more surface area entire roofs can be used to generate solar energy rather than single panels environmental street furniture takes it a step further by bringing small scale solar generation into many aspects of the urban environment such as smart benches rubbish bins and solar lighting in green spaces this opens up opportunities for powering cities including incorporating charging stations and network connectivity which in turn enables social power sharing repurposing plastic global recycling rates currently sit at approximately 18 indicating there are still further steps to take in ensuring singleuse products are eliminated plastic is a major target in the war on disposal and for good reason by 2015 the world had produced over seven billion tonnes of plastic  greenology is tackling this by harnessing a process called pyrolysis to turn plastic into power by heating waste at a very high temperature without oxygen the plastic is breaks down without combusting this process produces biooils which can be used to create biofuels the benefits of this innovative approach to waste are twofold not only can plastic be repurposed which minimises the lasting impact singleuse plastic has on the planet but the creation of biofuel offers a power source for everything from transport to generating electricity storing heat for the home decarbonising heating is one of the global challenges yet to have a clear answer pumped heat ltd phl is developing a potential solution with its heat battery technology the company has found a solution that enables its devices to charge up and store electricity during offpeak hours when electricity is at its cheapest and then use this energy to generate heating and hot water for homes as it is required as the grid continues to decarbonise and as renewable power becomes cheaper and more accessible the electricity used to charge these units will approach zero carbon content the heat battery technology utilises vacuum insulation losing 10 times less heat than a conventional night storage heater in contrast air sourced heat pumps a more commonly used type of heat pump operate in real time when a home needs heating they take water at its delivery temperature which can be very cold during the winter months and heat it using electricity available at that time pumped heats storage system instead ensures there is always heat available maintaining a consistent temperature for hot water or central heating rather than just when there is an excess of electricity the company claims the benefit of using a heat battery system is that it is cheaper than an oil or lpg boiler in a world where renewable electricity production both domestic and on a national level is only set to increase wastepowered planes as some of the most fossil fuelreliant industries in the world travel and transport are actively seeking alternative and more sustainable ways to keep them powered in long run velocys aims to do this using waste the company is developing sustainable fuels for aviation and heavy goods transport using the fischertropsch method of gasifying waste  this involves turning waste materials  such as domestic refuse and woody waste  into clean jet fuel using a catalytic chemical reaction where synthesis gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen are converted into liquid hydrocarbons that can then be used for fuel not only does this make use of waste products that could have ended up in landfill but it produces much cleaner fuels that emit less particle matter and harmful pollutants into the atmosphere as we enter a new decade of invention the world is focusing on more sustainable alternatives to power our lives and these innovative solutions to current environmental issues will continue to inspire creativity tags decarbonisation  renewable energy  sustainability  technology  transport  wind power 14 moments that electrified history 13 may 2020 electrification electricity is such a universal and accepted part of our lives its become something we take for granted rarely do we stop to consider the path it took to become ubiquitous and yet through the course of its history there have been several eureka moments and breakthrough inventions that have shaped our modern lives here are some of the defining moments in the development of electricity and power 2750 bc  electricity first recorded in the form of electric fish ancient egyptians referred to electric catfish as the  thunderers of the nile  and were fascinated by these creatures it led to a near millennia of wonder and intrigue including conducting and documenting crude experiments  such as touching the fish with an iron rod to cause electric shocks 500 bc  the discovery of static electricity around 500 bc thales of miletus discovered that static electricity could be made by rubbing lightweight objects such as fur or feathers on amber this static effect remained unknown for almost 2000 years until around 1600 ad when william gilbert discovered static electricity in earnest 1600 ad  the origins of the word electricity the latin word electricus  which translates to of amber was used by the english physician william gilbert to describe the force exerted when items are rubbed together a few years later english scientist thomas browne translated this into electricity in his written investigations in the field 1751  benjamin franklins experiments and observations on electricity this book of benjamin franklin s discoveries made about the behaviour of electricity was published in 1751 the publication and translation of american founding father scientist and inventors letters would provide the basis for all further electricity experimentation it also introduced a host of new terms to the field including positive negative charge battery and electric shock 1765  james watt transforms the industrial revolution watt studies newcomens engine james watt transformed the industrial revolution with the invention of a modified newcome engine now known as the watt steam engine  machines no longer had to rely on the sometimestemperamental wind water or manpower  instead steam from boiling water could drive the pistons back and forth although watts engine didnt generate electricity it created a foundation that would eventually lead to the steam turbine  still the basis of much of the globes electricity generation today james watts steam engine alessandro volta 1800  voltas first true battery documented records of batterylike objects date back to 250 bc but the first true battery was invented by italian scientist alessandro volta in 1800  volta realised that a current was created when zinc and silver were immersed in an electrolyte  the principal on which chemical batteries are still based today 1800s  the first electrical cars breakthroughs in electric motors and batteries in the early 1800s led to experimentation with electrically powered vehicles the british inventor robert anderson is often credited with developing the first crude electric carriage at the beginning of the 19 th century but it would not be until 1890 that american chemist william morrison would invent the first practical electric car though it closer resembled a motorised wagon boasting a top speed of 14 miles per hour michael faraday 1831  michael faradays electric dynamo faradays invention of the electric dynamo power generator set the precedent for electricity generation for centuries to come his invention converted motive or mechanical power  such as steam gas water and wind turbines  into electromagnetic power at a low voltage although rudimentary it was a breakthrough in generating consistent continuous electricity and opened the door for the likes of thomas edison and joseph swan whose subsequent discoveries would make largescale electricity generation feasible 1879  lighting becomes practical and inexpensive thomas edison patented the first practical and accessible incandescent light bulb  using a carbonised bamboo filament which could burn for more than 1200 hours edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent lightbulb on 31 st december 1879 where he stated that electricity would be so cheap that only the rich would burn candles although he was not the only inventor to experiment with incandescent light his was the most enduring and practical he would soon go on to develop not only the bulb but an entire electrical lighting system  holborn viaduct power station via wikimedia 1882  the worlds first public power station opens holborn viaduct power station also known as the edison electric light station  burnt coal to drive a steam turbine and generate electricity the power was used for holborns newly electrified streetlighting an idea which would quickly spread around london 1880s  tesla and edisons current war nikola tesla and thomas edison waged what came to be known as the current war in 1880s america tesla was determined to prove that alternating current ac  as is generated at power stations  was safe for domestic use going against the edison groups opinion that a direct current dc  as delivered from a battery  was safer and more reliable inside an edison power station in new york the conflict led to years of risky demonstrations and experiments including one where tesla electrocuted himself in front of an audience to prove he would not be harmed the war continued as they fought over the future of electric power generation until eventually ac won nikola tesla 1901  great britains first industrial power station opens before charles mertz and william mclellan of merz  mclellan built the neptune bank power station in tyneside in 1901 individual factories were powered by private generators by contrast the neptune bank power station could supply reliable cheap power to multiple factories that were connected through highvoltage transmission lines this was the beginning of britains national grid system 1990s  the first mass market electrical vehicle ev concepts for electric cars had been around for a century however the general motors ev1 was the first model to be mass produced by a major car brand  made possible with the breakthrough invention of the rechargeable battery however this ev1 model could not be purchased only directly leased on a monthly contract because of this its expensive build and relatively small customer following the model only lasted six years before general motors crushed the majority of their cars 2018  renewable generation accounts for a third of global power capacity the international renewable energy agencys irena 2018 annual statistics revealed that renewable energy accounted for a third of global power capacity in 2018 globally total renewable electricity generation capacity reached 2351 gw at the end of 2018 with hydropower accounting for almost half of that total while wind and solar energy accounted for most of the remainder tags electric vehicles evs  electricity  electricity generation  engineering  engineering and mathematics  history  power station  stem science  technology the uk needs negative emissions from beccs to reach net zero  heres why 7 april 2020 carbon capture reaching the uks target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate agreement beccs has the potential to play a vital role in power generation creating a hydrogen economy and offsetting other emissions as it continues to progress it is becoming increasingly

2020 carbon capture carbon capture use and storage ccus is a vital technology in the energy industry with facilities already in place all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide co 2  emissions however for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2 o c  as per the paris climate agreement  emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy from cement factories to farmland ccus technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world construction the global population is increasingly urban and by 2050 its estimated 68 of all people will live in cities  for cities to grow sustainably its crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced construction currently accounts for 11 of all global carbon emissions  this includes emissions from the actual construction work such as from vehicle exhaust pipes but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials steel and concrete are emissionsheavy to make they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions deploying widespread ccus in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment steel manufacturing alone regardless of the electricity used to power production is responsible for about 7 of global emissions  projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in europe and are already in motion in the united arab emirates abu dhabi national oil company and masdar a renewable energy and sustainability company formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercialscale ccus projects in its project with emirates steel which began in 2016 about 800000 tonnes of co 2 is captured a year from the steel manufacturing plant this is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery eor the commercially selfsustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrialscale projects in the region cement manufacturing a process that produces as much as 8 of global greenhouse gases  is also experiencing the growth of innovative ccus projects norcem cement plant in brevik norway has already begun experimenting with ccus calculating that it could capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year and store it under the north sea if the project wins government approval norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023 however as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it a team at massachusetts institute of technology is exploring a new method of cement production that is more ccus friendly  by pretreating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process the co 2 produced is released in a pure concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products such as fizzy drinks agriculture its hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry as well as feeding the world it employs a third of it  within this sector fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply however the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2 of global co 2 emissions ccus technology can reduce the co 2 contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser while maintaining crop reliability in 2019 oil and gas climate initiatives ogci climate investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest ccus project in the us based at the wabash valley resources fertiliser plant in indiana  the project will capture between 13 and 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the ammonia producer per year the captured carbon will then be stored 2000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer similarly since the turn of the millennium mitsubishi heavy industries engineering has deployed ccus technology at fertiliser plants around asia  co 2 is captured from natural gas precombustion and used to create the urea fertiliser however the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more naturebased and cheaper ways soil acts as a carbon sink capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it however intensive ploughing can damage the soils ability to retain co 2  it only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques like minimising soil disturbance or crop and grazing rotations to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of co 2 and even make farms carbon negative  transport the transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions according to the world health organisation electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sectors decarbonisation however at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads there are other essential modes of transport where ccus has a role to play climeworks a swiss company developing units that capture co 2 directly from the air has begun working with rotterdam the hague airport to develop a direct air capture dac unit on the airports grounds climeworks plant technology source climeworks photo by julia dunlop hydrogen filling station in hamburg germany however beyond just capturing co 2 from planes taking off climeworks aims to use the co 2 to produce a synthetic jet fuel  creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere a pilot project aims to create 1000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021 another approach to zerocarbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen which is already powering cars trains buses and even spacecraft  hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways but its predominantly created from natural gas through a process in which co 2 is a byproduct ccus can play an important role here in capturing the co 2 and storing it  preventing it entering the atmosphere the hydrogenpowered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat from every industry to every business to everyone as ccus technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites to entire economic regions global thermostat is developing dac technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes the system uses the waste heat to power a dac unit either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere such technologies along with those already in action like bioenergy

generation electricity networks around the world differ many ways from the frequency they run at to the fuels theyre powered by to the infrastructure they run on but they all share at least one core component circuits a circuit allows an electrical current to flow from one point to another moving it around the grid to seamlessly power street lights domestic devices and heavy industry without them electricity would have nowhere to flow and no means of reaching the things it needs to power but electricity can be volatile and when something goes wrong its often on circuits that problems first manifest thats where circuit breakers come in these devices can jump into action and break a circuit cutting off electricity flow to the faulty circuit and preventing catastrophe in homes and at grid scale all this must be done in milliseconds says drax electrical engineer jamie beardsall but to fully understand exactly how circuit breakers save the day its important to understand how and why circuits works circuits within circuits circuits work thanks to the natural properties of electricity which always wants to flow from a high voltage to a lower one  in the case of a battery or mains plug this means there are always two sides a negative side with a voltage of zero and a positive side with a higher voltage in a simple circuit electricity flows in a current along a conductive path from the positive side where there is a voltage to the negative side where there is a lower or no voltage the amount of current flowing depends on both the voltage applied and the size of the load within the circuit were able to make use of this flow of electricity by adding electrical devices  for example a lightbulb  to the circuit when the electricity moves through the circuit it also passes through the device in turn powering it a row of switched on household electrical circuit breakers on a wall panel the national grid  your regional power distributor our homes businesses and more are all composed of multiple circuits that enable the flow of electricity this means that if one circuit fails for example if a tree branch falls on a transmission cable only that circuit is affected rather than the entire nations electricity connection at a smaller scale if one light bulb in a house blows it will only affect that circuit not the entire building and while the cause of failures on circuits may vary from fallen tree branches to serious wiring faults to too many highvoltage appliances plugged into a single circuit  causing currents to shoot up and overload circuits the solution to preventing them is almost always the same fuses and circuit breakers in homes circuits are often protected from dangerously high currents by fuses which in great britain are normally found in standard threepin plugs and fuse boxes in a three pin plug each fuse contains a small wire  or element an electrical fuse when electricity passes through the circuit and fuse it heats up the wire but if the current running through the circuit gets too high the wire overheats and disintegrates breaking the circuit and preventing the wires and devices attached to it from being damaged when a fuse like this breaks in a plug or a fuse box it must be replaced a circuit breaker however can carry out this task again and again  instead of a piece of wire circuit breakers use an electromagnetic switch  when the circuit breaker is on the current flows through two points of contact when the current is at a normal level the adjacent electromagnet is not strong enough to separate the contact points however if the current increases to a dangerous level the electromagnet is triggered to kick into action and pulls one contact point away breaking the circuit and opening the circuit breaker another approach to fuses is using a strip made of two different types of metals as current increases and temperatures rise one metal expands faster than the other causing the strip to bend and break the circuit once the connection is broken the strip cools allowing the circuit breaker to be reset this approach means the problem on the circuit can be identified and solved for example by unplugging a highvoltage appliance from the circuit before flipping the switch back on and reconnecting the circuit protecting generators at grid scale power circuit breakers for a highvoltage network circuit breakers are important in residential circuits but at grid level they become even more crucial in preventing widescale damage to the transmission system and electricity generators if part of a transmission circuit is damaged for example by high winds blowing over a power line the current flow within that circuit can be disrupted and can flow to earth rather than to its intended load or destination this is what is known as a short circuit much like in the home a short circuit can result in dangerous increases in current with the potential to damage equipment in the circuit or nearby equipment used in transmission circuits can cost millions of pounds to replace so it is important this current flow is stopped as quickly as possible circuit breakers are the light switches of the transmission system says beardsall they must operate within milliseconds of an abnormal condition being detected however in terms of similarities with the home this is where it ends current levels in the home are small  usually below 13 amps a or ampere for an individual circuit with the total current coming into a home rarely exceeding 80a in a transmission system current levels are much higher beardsall explains a single transmission circuit can have current flows in excess of 2000a and voltages up to 400000 volts because the current flowing through the transmission system is much greater than that around a home breaking the circuit and stopping the current flow becomes much harder a small air gap is enough to break a circuit at a domestic level but at gridscale voltage is so high it can arc over air gaps creating a visible plasma bridge  to suppress this the contact points of the circuit breakers used in transmission systems are often contained in housings filled with insulating gases or within a vacuum which are not conductive and help to break the circuit a 400kv circuit breaker on the drax power station site in addition there will often be several contact points within a single circuit breaker to help break the high current and voltage levels older circuit breakers used oil or highpressure air for breaking current although these are now largely obsolete in a transmission system circuit breakers will usually be triggered by relays  devices which measure the current flowing through the circuit and trigger a command to open the circuit breaker if the current exceeds a predetermined value the whole process says beardsall from the abnormal current being detected to the circuit breaker being opened can occur in under 100 milliseconds circuit breakers are not only used for emergencies though they can also be activated to shut off parts of the grid or equipment for maintenance or to direct power flows to different areas a single circuit breaker used within the home would typically be small enough to fit in your hand a single circuit breaker used within the transmission system may well be bigger than your home circuit breakers are a key piece of equipment in use at drax power station just as they are within your home largely unnoticed the largest power station in the uk has hundreds of circuit breakers installed all around the site a 3300 volt circuit breaker at drax power station they provide protection for everything from individual circuits powering pumps fans and fuel conveyors right through to protecting the main 660 megawatt mw generators allowing either individual items of plant to be disconnected or enabling full generating units to be disconnected from the national grid explains beardsall the circuit breakers used at drax in north yorkshire vary significantly operating at voltages from 415 volts right up to 400000 volts they vary in size from something like a washing machine to something taller than a double decker bus although the size capacity and scale of the circuit breakers varies dramatically all perform the same function  allowing different parts of electrical circuits to be switched on and off and ensuring electrical system faults are isolated as quickly as possible to keep damage and danger to people to a minimum while the voltages and amount of current is much larger at a power station than in any home the approach to quickly breaking a circuit remains the same while circuits are integral parts of any power system they would mean nothing without a failsafe way of breaking them tags drax power

co 2  from power station refinery and factory exhausts has long been hailed as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the uk and the rest of the world to net zero  after a number of false starts and policy hurdles the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever carbon capture use and storage ccus is finally coming of age increasing innovation and investment in the space is enabling the development of ccus schemes at scale today there are over 19 largescale ccus facilities in operation worldwide while a further 32 in development as confidence in government policies and investment frameworks improves once co 2 is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers in a process known as

february 2020 power generation massive spinning machinery is a big part of electricity generation whether its a wind turbine hydro plant or biomass generator but big spinning turbines dont just pump electricity out onto the grid they also play a crucial role in keeping the electricity system stable safe and efficient this is because big heavy spinning turbines add something else to the grid inertia  this is defined as an objects resistance to change but in the context of electricity it helps the grid remain at the right frequency and voltage level in short they help the grid remain stable however as electricity systems in great britain and other parts of the world move away from coal and gas to renewables such as wind turbines solar panels and interconnectors the level of inertia on the system is falling we need the inertia we dont need the megawatts explains julian leslie head of networks at the national grid electricity system operator eso but in todays market we have to supply the megawatts and receive the inertia as a consequence engineer inspecting turbine blades at drax power station the national grid eso is taking a new approach to this aspect of grid stability by using what are called synchronous condensers these complicatedsounding pieces of machinery are actually quite straightforward in their concept they provide inertia to the grid without generating unnecessary power these come in the form of existing generators that remain connected to the grid but refrain from producing electricity purpose built machines whose only function is to act as synchronous condensers never generating real power these may be fitted with flywheels to increase their mass and in consequence their inertia this means that spinning without generating is about to become a very important part of great britains electricity system around and around electricity generators that spin at 3000 rpm are described as synchronous generators because they are in sync with the grids frequency of 50hz these include coal gas hydro biomass turbines and nuclear units most spin at 3000 rpm some machines much less eg 750 rpm thanks to the way they are designed they are all synchronised together at the same higher speed then there are wind turbines where the generated power is not synchronised to the grid system termed asynchronous generators these machines do not have readily accessible stored energy inertia and do not contribute to the stability of the system interconnectors and solar panels are also asynchronous its important that great britains whole grid is kept within 1 of the 50hz frequency  otherwise the voltage of electricity starts to fluctuate damaging equipment becoming less efficient even dangerous or resulting in blackouts say a power station or a wind farm were to drop offline as occurred in august 2019  this would cause the amount of power on the grid to suddenly fall but it is not just the power that changes  the frequency and voltage also fluctuate dramatically which can cause equipment damage and ultimately towns cities or widespread areas to lose power running machines that have inertia act like the suspension on a car  they dampen those fluctuations so they are not as drastic the big spinning machines keep spinning buying valuable milliseconds for the grid to react often automatically before the damage becomes widespread however as a consequence of decarbonisation more solar panels and wind turbines are now on the system and there are fewer spinning turbines leading to lower levels of inertia on the grid there are periods when renewable generation and flow from interconnectors are so great that it displaces all conventional rotational power plants says leslie today bringing more inertia onto the grid may mean switching off renewables or interconnectors and then replacing them with rotating plants and the megawatts associated with that creating a market for inertia and synchronous condensers offers a new way forward  providing inertia without unneeded megawatts or emissions from fossil fuels a new spin on grid stability at the start of 2020 the national grid eso began contracting parties including draxs cruachan pumpedhydro power station  to operate synchronous condensers and provide inertia to the grid when needed the plans mark a departure from the previous system where inertia and voltage control from electricity generators was taken for granted cruachan power station is already capable of running its units in synchronous condenser mode one of its units opened up for maintenance is pictured at the top of this article this involves an alternator acting as a motor offering inertia to the grid without generating unneeded electricity other service providers will repurpose existing turbines construct new machines or develop new technologies that can electronically respond to the grids need for stability synchronous condensers or the idea of spinning a turbine freely without generating power are not new concepts power stations in the second half of the 20 th century could shut down certain generating units but keep them spinning online for voltage control in the 1960s and 70s some substations  where the voltage of electricity is stepped up and down from the transmission system  also deployed standalone synchronous condensers these were also used to provided inertia as well as voltage control but are long since decommissioned synchronous condenser installation at templestowe substation melbourne victoria australia by mriya via wikimedia  synchronous condensers are a proven technology that have been used in the past says leslie and there are many new technologies we are now exploring that can deliver a similar service cheaper cleaner more stable the national grid eso estimates the technology will save electricity consumers up to 128 million over the next six years savings which come from negating the need for the grid to call upon fossil fuels for inertia as coal oil and gas become increasingly uneconomical across the globe as carbon taxes grow the fact that synchronous condensers do not produce electricity also saves money the grid may have had to pay out to renewable generators to stop them producing electricity or to storage systems to absorb excess power it means the market can deliver the renewable flow without the grid having to pay to restrain it or to pay for gas to stabilise the system says leslie not only does this allow more renewable generation but it also reduces the cost to the consumer in a future energy system where there is an abundance of renewable electricity generations synchronous condensers will be crucial in keeping the grid stable the national grid esos investment in the technology further highlights the importance of new ideas and innovation to balance the grid through this energy transition  synchronous generation provides benefits to system stability beyond the provision of inertia in a subsequent article well also explore how synchronous condensers can assist with voltage stability and help regional electricity networks and customers to remain connected to the national system during and after
