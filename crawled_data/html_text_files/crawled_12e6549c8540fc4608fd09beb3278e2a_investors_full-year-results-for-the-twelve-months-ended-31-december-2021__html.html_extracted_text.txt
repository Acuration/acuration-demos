Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner
“2021 was a transformational year for Drax as we became the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply company, whilst continuing to invest in delivering positive outcomes for the climate, nature and people.
“Over the past ten years Drax has invested over £2 billion in renewable energy and has plans to invest a further £3 billion this decade, supporting the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Our investment has reduced our emissions from power generation by over 95% and we are the UK’s largest producer of renewable power by output. We are proud to be one of the lowest carbon intensity power generators in Europe – a significant transformation from being the largest coal power station in Western Europe.
“We have significantly advanced our plans for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the UK and globally. By 2030 we aim to deliver 12 million tonnes of negative emissions and lead the world in providing a critical technology which scientists agree is key to delivering the global transition to net zero.”

(1)
Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (revaluation of deferred tax balances reflecting future increases in UK CT rates, acquisition costs, gain on sale of CCGT generation assets, restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements.
(3)
Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(4)
FSC License code: FSC-C119787.
(5)
Total $/t cost of production in Pellet Production – raw fibre, processing into a wood pellet, delivery to Drax port facilities in US and Canada, loading to vessel for shipment and overheads – Free on Board (FOB). Cost of ocean freight, UK port and rail cost reflected in Generation business accounts in addition to price paid to Pellet Production for the biomass pellet.
(6)
Typical estimated annual biomass generation from ROC and CfD units c.15TWh based on estimated biomass availability.
(7)
Structured power sales in 2023 and 2024 (forward gas sales as a proxy for forward power), transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to forward power prices.
(8)
The CfD biomass unit typically operates as a baseload unit, with power sold forward against a season ahead reference price. The CfD counterparty pays the difference between the season ahead reference price and the strike price. The contracted position therefore only includes CfD volumes and prices for the front six months.
