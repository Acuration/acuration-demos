says new report from oxford economics 7 september 2016 energy business drax contributed more than 1 billion towards uk gdp in 2015 and supported thousands of jobs across the country the findings were revealed in a new report looking at the groups uk operations which includes drax power station  europes largest decarbonisation project researchers at oxford economics studied the impact of drax group on the uks economy as the company nears completion of a major high tech engineering and infrastructure project to upgrade half the generating units at drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass in place of coal with the right support from government drax aims to upgrade the remainder of the power station their report estimates that the groups uk activities and that of companies in its supply chain last year contributed 12 billion to the economy and supported 14150 jobs  employment covered a wide range of sectors including highskilled manufacturing of industrial components engineering and technical machinery construction it professional business services and transport this combination of activity and employment also generated tax revenues for the uk estimated at 430 million equivalent to the salaries of almost 16500 nurses or 12900 teachers oxford economics used three measures to calculate drax groups gdp contribution the direct activities of the group and its contractors activity and employment in the supply chain of the group and its contractors and spending by all employees involved a breakdown of the gdp generated by drax group shows all regions of the uk benefited highlights include 493 million created in draxs heartland of yorkshire and the humber  1100 jobs for the north east and 82m contributed to the local economy 191 million generated in the east of england  where the groups retail arm haven power is based 1700 jobs supported in scotland and 120 million generated in its economy 550 jobs sustained and 42 million contributed to gdp in the south west  the report also analysed the economic impact of upgrading drax to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal it reveals this project has thus far generated 710 million in gdp throughout the uk economy and supported 11400 jobs half of these in construction manufacturing and transport drax group ceo dorothy thompson said this report shows drax is supporting more than 14000 jobs across the uk with the vast majority resulting from our upgrades to biomass technology the economic benefit has reached all parts of the country we have been the catalyst for rejuvenation and growth across the northern powerhouse with port expansion on the coasts of east yorkshire the north west and north east drax is now the uks biggest single generator of renewable power with the right support from government we aim to upgrade more of our electricity production to using compressed wood pellets this would provide a further boost to the uk economy and deliver increased carbon savings sam moore managing director of consultancy at oxford economics said drax group makes an important economic contribution to yorkshire and the humber and the uk more widely its activities generated over 1 billion in gdp last year and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation in addition ambitious investments by the group and its partners in regional biomass infrastructure have driven huge demand and supported many more thousands of jobs the drax upgrades to use biomass in place of coal are also environmentally and strategically very significant in the context of the wider challenges for the uks energy system ends full details of the study can be found at draximpactcouk media contacts jennifer davies press officer drax 01757 612084 email protected richard harrisonsarah harrison imagen pr

company that owns and operates the uks largest power station in selby north yorkshire typically providing some 8 of the uks electricity a vital strategic asset the group has transformed itself into a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator through its use of innovative technology and sustainably sourced wood pellets the largest decarbonisation project in europe is underway to provide the uk with costeffective lowcarbon and reliable renewable power about oxford economics oxford economics was founded in 1981 as a commercial venture with oxford universitys business college to provide
