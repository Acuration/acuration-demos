just some of the fun activities children can enjoy during a brand new family event organised by drax to celebrate british science week the free outdoor event  a bit of science for a change explores the theme of changing states of matter and will take place within the woods at the skylark centre and nature reserve between 11am and 3pm on sunday 19 march children use a map to locate a series of science stations hidden around the nature reserve and then answer questions to earn the equipment and materials needed to complete fun sciencebased challenges investigating the changing states of liquids gases and solids drax visitor centre coordinator jane breach said this is the first event drax has hosted as part of british science week and weve come up with a number of handson challenges designed to appeal to children of all ages and abilities we hope this will be a great opportunity for families to come together enjoy our beautiful nature reserve and learn something along the way she added discovering how to make a cd hover above the ground and create magnetic slime are just some of the exciting activities planned for our more competitive participants weve even created a top gearstyle leader board to record the furthest distance achieved by gaspropelled cars drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping children in their stem studies science technology engineering and maths and recently launched project reinvent  a secondary schools challenge to develop an idea using stem learning to improve their local community entry to a bit of science for a change is free and there is no need to prebook picnics are permitted on designated areas of the nature reserve for more information call 01757 612797 or email email protected  editors notes british
