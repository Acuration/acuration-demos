biomass energy forests sustainability and biomass  the experts view matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 6 october 2016 opinion it was a forestry catastrophe that first inspired matthew rivers interest in forests dutch elm trees an iconic part of the uk landscape for over 250 years were becoming infected with a fatal and fastspreading disease the race was on to save them a schoolboy in north london at the time rivers joined the after curricular school team tasked with saving its trees  first by injecting them with insecticide and when that didnt work by felling and replanting them it was an early foundation in how forests work and the challenges of keeping them healthy decades later rivers is director of corporate affairs at drax its a role he finds himself in following a career as a forester helping to manage forestry businesses and supporting the setting up of wood product manufacturing plants his own estimation of his working life is a humble one however i think im probably a failed farmer he says a forester always plants in hope rivers studied forestry at university in scotland before taking up jobs in the forestry industry across the uk uruguay and finland working in this industry he says is one that requires patience in the uk were talking about 30 or 40year growth cycles the trees i planted at the start of my career are only just coming to maturity now he explains but more than the long investment of time being a forester relies on faith a forester always plants in hope he says when a forester plants a tree he or she most commonly does not know who the end customer will be so when the call came from drax for a forestry expert to help guide the company through an important transformation  upgrading the power station from coal to biomass  the challenge was one he was ready to take drax already had ambitions of converting three boilers to run on biomass that would mean consuming tonnes of compressed wood pellets he says the business needed a supply and rivers was drafted in to set this up as part of the supply solution and chaired by rivers drax set up drax biomass  a pellet manufacturing business in the usa that makes and supplies compressed wood pellets to drax power station  setting up its own manufacturing plant not only means drax needs to rely on fewer external suppliers but also that it can use the learnings about the technologies the economics and the sourcing of the process to continually hone its supply chain to operate responsibly and receive governmental support drax has to be sustainable and this is particularly important when it comes to where and how it sources its fuel this comes with its own challenges no universal definition of sustainability to my understanding there is no universal definition of sustainability says rivers so how do you proof your business for an unclear entity at its heart sustainability is about not doing anything today that would prejudice doing the same thing for the next generation or generations to come a responsibly managed forest is one that is as healthy productive diverse and useful in 100 or 500 years time as it is today they key to this is to think of forests as a whole rivers explains think about a single tree  you fell it and use it to heat your home over one winter but its going to take perhaps 30 years for that tree to grow back he says what do you do for the next 30 years in a sustainably managed forest you have all different ages of tree represented  one thirtieth devoted to each age and when you use an older tree to warm you in winter you plant a replacement that way for every year youll have trees reaching maturity ready to provide your power its a cycle that if managed responsibly keeps delivering a useful resource as well as maintaining the health of the forest rivers continues sustainability is the very nature of what a forester does because if we dont take care of our forests and ensure we have a crop to harvest year after year we lose our livelihood becoming a private forester two decades ago rivers completed a loop he started decades ago amidst the dutch elm crisis and became a forest owner himself in scotland he bought and now manages his own private forest weve had kids birthday parties weve dug out a pond we harvest chanterelles in the autumn  theres a millennium capsule buried somewhere he says its not only a family heirloom its a place for him to exercise a passion  maintaining and managing a responsible and healthy forest tags careers  wood pellets  sustainability  biomass energy a solution for cheaper cleaner power sustainable bioenergy britain has some big energy targets ahead of it  namely an 80 reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 figures a renewable energy future is not an optimistic target it is a necessary one but for this picture to also be a practical one it needs to be affordable a study from nera and imperial college london commissioned by drax suggests there are ways for renewable technology to be cheaper than it currently is in fact in one scenario they looked at there could be savings to the tune of 22 billion incentivising decarbonisation its a positive and necessary support mechanism however some renewable technologies like compressed wood pellets a form of biomass are excluded from participating in upcoming the auctions scheduled between 201720 why is this missing the bigger picture currently cfd support is based on how much a particular type of electricity costs combined with how much it takes to build and maintain the facility used to generate it this figure is whats called the levelised cost of energy lcoe the spanner in the works comes in that not all costs are considered in making this judgement powering a country requires more than just a power source we need ancillary services like backup power to get the country back on the rails in the event of largescale blackouts  and voltage control to ensure electronic devices continue to work and that power can move around the network the costs associated with these services  system integration costs sics  are excluded from the cfd equation sources like wind and solar being intermittent cant offer most of these ondemand ancillary services but we still need them to play a part in the uks energy supply biomass facilities can provide a number of these itself meaning it actually has a negative sic cost however in the current pricing system  ignoring these associated costs  biomass is considered more expensive than onshore wind and solar with the high sic costs for wind and solar included biomass is in fact the cheapest option finding the right mix this is not to say that solar and wind are not an integral part of a more renewable future a truly flexible low carbon high voltage electricity grid should be a mix of elements current rules do not look at the full picture and are ruling out important alternatives but there are possible solutions one could be unifying the markets there are four markets that feed into the uks electricity supply and theres little transparency or cohesion between them this leads to inefficiencies jens price wolf regulations and market director at drax explains solar is the cheapest renewable diesel is the cheapest option in the capacity market and gas will be the cheapest for energy production by considering each market as separate you end up buying the cheapest solution for that individual purpose rather than considering its performance across all this misses out solutions that can benefit the whole system biomass might be the second cheapest option in each field says wolf so supporting investment to upgrade existing coal power stations with biomass technology satisfies multiple needs and leads to it being ultimately cheaper than the old mix a single market approach that treats all technologies and generation methods in the same way could lead to significant cost savings and those savings could be passed on to bill payers in households and businesses while this could be a longerterm solution there are ways shortterm actions that can make a difference if the government were to include biomass in the mix for the next round of cfd auctions it could bring about savings of over 2 billion over the next 15 years or a 85 saving per household over the same period and it would do this while ensuring the grid remains adaptable without sacrificing emissions targets tags biomass energy  energy policy this is how you make a biomass wood pellet sustainable bioenergy wood has been used as fuel for tens of thousands of years but this wood  a compressed wood pellet  is different its the size of a childs crayon and weighs next to nothing but when combined with many more it is a smart solution to generating cleaner electricity compared to coal wood pellets like these are being used at drax power station to generate electricity and power cities not only are they renewable and sustainable but because they are compressed dried and made from incredibly fine wood fibres theyre also a very efficient fuel for power stations this is how a compressed wood pellet is made at the drax biomass amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi the wood arrives to the yard wood arrives at the plant via truck and is sent to one of four places the wood storage yard the wood circle where wood is primed for processing the piles of sawdust and woodchip or straight into processing bark is removed and kept for fuel logs are fed into a debarker machine which beats the logs together inside a large drum to remove the bark the bark is put aside and used to fuel the woodchip dryer used later in the process thinned wood stems become small chips the logs  lowvalue fibre from sustainably managed working forests  need to be cut down into even smaller pieces so they can then be shredded into the fine material needed for creating pellets inside the wood chipper multiple blades spin and cut the logs into chips roughly 10mm long and 3mm thick the resulting chips are fed into the woodchip pile ready for screening chips are screened for quality and waste is removed chipped down wood can include waste elements like sand remaining bark or stones that can affect pellet production the chips are passed through a screener that removes the waste leaving only ideal sized wood chips the biggest hairdryer youve ever seen the wood chips need to have a moisture level of between 115 and 12 before they go into the pelleting process anything other than this and the quality of the resulting pellets could be compromised the chips enter a large drum which is blasted with hot air generated in a heater powered by bark collected from the debarker the chips are moved through the drum by a large fan ready for the hammer mill small woodchips become even smaller woodchips inside the hammer mill theres a spinning shaft mounted with a series of hammers the wood chips are fed into the top of the drum and the spinning hammers chip and shred them down into a fine powdery substance that is used to create the pellets putting the chips under pressure  a lot of pressure the shredded woodchip powder is fed into the pellet mill inside a rotating arm presses the powdered wood fibre through a grate featuring a number of small holes the intense pressure heats up the wood fibre and helps it bind together as it passes through the holes in a metal ring dye forming the compressed wood pellets resting and cooling down fresh pellets from the mill are damp and hot and need to rest and cool before transporting off site theyre moved to large storage silos kept at low temperatures so the pellets can cool and harden ready for shipping one of the biggest domes youve ever seen this is the final stage before shipping specially designed and constructed storage domes are used to store the wood pellets after they are transported to the mississippi river louisiana and before they make their way across the atlantic to the uk tags about us  wood pellets  power station  biomass energy  technology the 4 most common myths about renewables power generation renewables make up more of the worlds energy mix than ever before and yet misconceptions about these new or alternative technologies  such as biomass solar and wind  are common some of these concerns are  for the time being  partly justified some completely subjective and some are demonstrably wrong heres a closer look at the most pervasive myths and what truth there is behind them renewables are unpredictable an oftrepeated misconception is that renewables arent a fulltime solution to our power needs its true that solar isnt generated at night and wind turbines dont operate in still weather but the canon of renewables is bigger than its two most wellknown technologies tidal power still depends on environmental factors but tides are much more predictable than wind or sunlight for countries lucky enough to have ready access geothermal power  which uses heat from the earths core to power generators  is even more reliable biomass solutions such as compressed wood pellets are a fuelbased power source meaning they are flexible so can be used to generate electricity on demand and operate as a baseload power option much like coal or gas at drax power station renewable electricity is generated on demand using compressed wood pellets and delivered to the national grid 24hoursaday now thanks to advances in weather forecasting the national grid can plan ahead to balance the system with other renewable and low carbon technologies when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing just a few years ago the primary fall back was relying on coal power stations to pick up any slack it might not be possible to power the world entirely with one renewable source but the right mix of technologies could provide an answer to the question of how to ensure a stable and secure low carbon energy supply renewables are expensive there is some truth in this but its important to note that these costs are falling many of the high costs associated with renewables have been down to a lack of infrastructure investment a number of the components required in construction of structures like wind turbines and solar panels are expensive and as many renewable facilities need to be located in different areas to existing traditional facilities extensive power grid extension is often needed but these are problems that once set up should bring down the costs of renewables such as solar and wind setting up biomasspowered facilities is considerably cheaper compressed wood pellets can be used in upgraded coal power stations so theres no need for expensive new connections to the highvoltage electricity transmission system there are even ways renewables could bring about cheaper power for consumers research commissioned by drax and published by nera economic consulting and imperial college london found that if the same government support offered to some renewable technologies ie wind and solar were open to all such as biomass consumers could see potential savings of 2 billion on their energy bills renewables are ugly while this isnt necessarily an opinion shared by everyone it is one that is often cited onshore wind farms often draw the most ire but they arent alone large investments are being made in offshore wind farms which are both more discrete and better positioned to take advantage of stronger offshore currents and hydropower projects like dams and tidal barrages can in the long term create whole new habitats ecosystems and leisure facilities in the form of artificial lakes and surrounding forests nobody uses renewables in 2015 99 of costa ricas electricity came from renewable sources including hydro geothermal wind biomass and solar closer to home sweden draws more than 50 of its electricity from renewable sources including 22 from bioenergy  90 of which comes from forestry in the uk renewables use is steady and rising accounting for 25 of all electricity generated domestically in 2015 in the first half of 2016 20 of the uks renewable power was supplied by drax contrast those figures against coal which in the uk declined from supplying 308 of uk power needs in q1 2015 to just 158 in q1 2016 and our increasing use of renewables is even more evident consumers have been buying 100 renewable electricity tariffs from companies such as good energy for more than a decade businesses are increasingly getting in on the act too two thirds of the power generated by drax in the first half of 2016 was sold directly to companies via drax groups business electricity supplier haven power  and with campaigns such as re100 challenging the worlds biggest firms to commit to renewableonly power household brands such as ikea ms and google are either already 100 renewable or only a few years away misconceptions about renewables will remain as long as were still in the transition out of fossil fuel use but the industry has made huge strides from where it was just 10 years ago thanks to better more affordable technology an increasingly friendly corporate sector and a greater awareness of environmental issues at large these products and services will continue to improve grow and increasingly becoming more mainstream tags wind power  energy policy  biomass energy an alternative way to heat your home sustainable bioenergy there are things we as a modern society expect in our homes running water electricity at the touch of a button heating for when temperatures drift south all are ubiquitous in the uk serviced by large networks that deliver these resources on demand but there are some areas in the country that exist apart in the uk there remains a large proportion of homes off the gas grid without the benefits of easytoaccess gas and gas boilers these households rely on other forms of heating often fuelled by expensive and highcarbon fuels like oil or liquid petroleum gas lpg but there are alternatives to these and of those fuels biomass is not only an increasingly affordable one but a cleaner one too how do you heat your home with biomass biomass boilers work in much the same way that a gas powered one does they use fuel to generate a heat source that then heats water which is passed through radiators and into your households hot water supplies whereas the majority of boilers in the uk use gas as a fuel source biomass boilers run on natural wood products such as compressed wood pellets its an efficient and effective way of heating homes and in europe its a common one in sweden 1400000 tonnes of pellets were used in 2014 for heating compare that with the uks 300000  in a country with six times the population  and the difference is stark biomass covers more of europes energy requirements than any other but in the uk were falling behind continental averages a cleaner cheaper alternative wood is a simple renewable fuel a growing tree absorbs carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere which is released when the wood is used to generate energy in the form of heat or electricity new trees are planted to replace the old ones and the carbon dioxide is absorbed all over again thanks to this cyclical process biomass fuel is sustainable this makes compressed wood pellets a more climatefriendly fuel source than the fossil fuels of the past such as diesel and oil as well as being renewable there are financial benefits too a woodfuelled biomass boiler offers significant savings when compared with electric heating support towards a cleaner future the government has recognised the importance of technologies such as biomassfuelled boilers in achieving a lower carbon future the renewable heat inventive rhi programme was introduced to provide incentives to homeowners landlords and commercial customers for installing generators of renewable heat such as wood pellet boilers its objective is to try to achieve the target of ensuring that 12 of the uks heating comes from renewable sources by 2020 currently it makes up just 5 of the total but with improving technology and a more regular supply of biomass fuel  such as that offered by amp clean energy previously billington bioenergy to domestic customers  domestic wood pellet heating could become something thats not just a niche option but a serious alternative to off grid homes tags biomass energy  energy policy inside the dome sustainable bioenergy there are four storage domes at drax power station and each of them can hold 80000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets its these biomass pellets a sustainable fuel that drax is being upgraded to run on and produce renewable electricity wood pellets are an incredible fuel that can match coal for efficiency  the challenge is you just need more of them as the density and calorific value of coal is greater however storing such large quantities in a confined space presents risks that have to be managed 247 atmospheric control the crucial difficulty with storing the pellets is their chemical volatility wood which the pellets are made from emit carbon monoxide co in a confined space such as the storage dome this co can build up and  due to cos extreme flammability  require the entire internal atmosphere to be regulated by a set of highly sophisticated engineering solutions as long as materials are emitting more heat into the atmosphere than they are storing in themselves there is no risk of combustion a single wood pellet in a fuel store poses no fire risk nor does a small pile but when thousands upon thousands are piled together the pressure builds up and causes the pellets to heat up gradually the rate of temperature increase speeds up and before you know the flashpoint threshold has been crossed and theres potential for danger however remove or limit the oxygen supply in the silo and purge the co thats emitted from the pellets and the risk of a thermal event is substantially reduced the challenge for the engineers at drax constructing the domes was finding a way to manage temperatures within the dome neutral nitrogen to do this they created a system to automatically inject nitrogen into the storage dome while nitrogen isnt a truly inert gas it is much less reactive than co and oxygen with this pumped into the domes atmosphere it is a much safer environment to get a steady supply of nitrogen regular air from our atmosphere  which is 78 nitrogen  is passed through a molecular filter which removes the larger oxygen molecules the gas collected at the other end is 96 nitrogen this nitrogenrich air is then injected from underneath the dome and continually distributed around it not only is this a fire prevention method but also a firefighting one that can be pumped in larger quantities in the event of combustion separate to the above measures which are there to manage fuel temperatures the dome is also fitted with a carbon dioxide co2 injection system and water deluge system which are there as fire extinguishing precautions the big ear inside the dome the next problem facing the designers was how to accurately monitor the quantity of compressed wood pellets inside the dome to achieve this each dome is fitted with a sonar system  which sounds a bit like a chirping bird  that provides continuous feedback on how full the dome is the sonar monitoring system provides level profile and volume information which is translated into a 3d image of the stored biomass this method of volumunetric measurement allows the operators to view and monitor in real time the effects of their actions when filling and unloading domes so they can target specific areas particularly when unloading and for fuel accounting purposes other tools and tricks five thermocouple arrays measure the pile temperature and provide feedback in real time to the operators to allow them to assess the status of the dome and effectively plan material filling and reclaim gas monitors measure the levels of co and co2 as well as o2 depletion within the head space of the dome a dome breather vent a two way acting valve which as its name suggests allows the dome to breathe is fitted to the top of the dome and acts as a vacuum breaker maintaining a relatively even pressure allowing air in during unloading and releasing head space gasses during nitrogen inserting the final piece of the atmospheric control puzzle is regulating pressure at the top of each dome is a controllable aperture called a slide gate which is closed unless the dome is being filled to allow material to enter a dome aspiration system is installed here to filter and remove displaced air from within the head space during filling but also allow a route for co and other offgassing products to escape all the hidden systems within these four huge white domes allow the operator to effectively control their atmospheric conditions and crucially to store massive amounts of potentially volatile biomass safely on site find out more about these giant storage domes  read the story about how they were constructed  tags wood pellets  engineering  technology  biomass energy how does europe use biomass sustainable bioenergy at the heart of norse folklore is a figure called yggdrasil that connects its nine worlds and gods its an immensely important and holy icon but it is not a god itself  it is an ash tree that the central figure of mythical scandinavian cosmology should be something as humble as a tree is no surprise scandinavia is a heavily forested region sweden the largest country in the area is more than 68 forest wood is an inherent part of life there for thousands of years its been used as a resource and a fuel and today is no different throughout much of europe the same is true but while historically wood was used only for cooking heating and light today its use as a form of energy also includes generating electricity and heat when formed into compressed wood pellets europe and wood pellets nearly 22 million tonnes mt of wood pellets were used in the european union in 2015 making the region the leading wood pellet consumer in the world it is also the worlds leading producer creating roughly half of the worlds global output  largely from european trees a report from the standing forestry committee set up to represent the forestry industries in eu countries found that just 4 of the woody biomass used in the eu was imported of the 22mt used across europe 105mt was used for heating while 115mt was used for industrial uses like fueling power plants but in the uk the level of wood used for fuel falls some way behind eu averages thanks in large part to drax and its transition from coal to renewable wood pelletpowered electricity generation thats changing but the uk still has a way to go to catch the continental average where is the uk falling behind and how is wood being used to power the rest of the continent here we look at some of the largest consumers and producers of biomass in europe and how its being used sweden sweden is the third highest consumer of wood as a source of energy in europe trailing only finland and latvia in its use a key use of biomass in sweden is powering district heating systems in a district heating system rather than each building or home having its own boiler whole areas of cities are heated through a single central plant distributing heat to buildings these plants can be powered by a variety of fuels but many run on wood pellets or distribute the waste heat captured at power plants germany in 1713 an accountant and mining administrator hans carl von carlowitz published what is considered the first ever book to look in depth at forestry management effectively kickstarting the modern idea of sustainable forestry in the 300 years that have passed germany has embraced the cultivation of wood and has made wood and biomass a fixed part of its energy makeup more recently the renewable energy heating act and market incentive programme was passed in 2009 which requires new building owners to provide a percentage of their heat from renewable sources including woodfired boilers the aim is to increase the countrys share of renewable heat to 14 by 2020 finland nearly three quarters of finland is forestland making it one of the most forested countries in the world let alone europe as a result wood plays a large part in finnish culture stora enso one of the worlds leading paper and packaging manufacturers is finnish and more than 20 of the countrys exports are from wood and wood products coupled with a strong focus generating much of its energy from renewables energy derived from wood and products made from wood is high united kingdom in 2013 less than 10 of all energy used in the uk was generated from wood and wood products this places it some way behind countries like germany and sweden in part owing to a lack of infrastructure for providing heating derived from wood and wood biomass this could change if the government continues to back technologies equally in initiatives like the renewable heat incentive rhi available to homeowners landlords and commercial customers rhi provides incentives for installing generators of renewable heat such as wood pellet boilers  to reach climate goals the then department of energy and climate change noted that both biomassdriven electricity generation and heating should continue to increase in the uk and with the upgrade of drax and lynemouth power stations from coal to compressed wood pellets there are positive signs the uk can catch up to the european biomass average in doing so renewable biomass electricity generation can also help increase wind and solar power generation in the uk and help create a more sustainable energy future tags wood pellets  biomass energy  energy policy mind the gap dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 28 july 2016 opinion later today the edf board is expected to give the goahead for a new nuclear power station at hinkley this will provide some long overdue clarity for britains energy sector but we now need to quickly move on and make the right decisions to secure the best mix of power generation the drawn out debate around hinkley point c has diverted attention away from the sectors biggest challenge the government has made it clear that coal must come off the system by 2025 but coal still provides up to one fifth of the uks electricity and plugging that gap will be far from easy nor will doing so in a way that allows the country to meet its carbon targets while supporting the technologies that will deliver a modern energy system fit for the 21st century the governments intention is absolutely right but how does it intend to meet its target lets be clear a positive hinkley point c decision will play an important role in the necessary energy mix but will provide no silver bullet by most estimates when finally complete the nuclear plant will provide seven percent of the uks electricity needs however this isnt expected to come on grid much before 2030 and lets remember that in 2030 all but one of the uks current operating nuclear reactors are scheduled to be closed hinkley will therefore be replacing only some of the lost nuclear capacity not providing new energy to replace coal the last few years have seen a huge and welcome expansion in renewable sources of generation like wind and solar in the uk but they are intermittent and cannot fill the gap alone they still need to be supported by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine  a regular scenario on these shores as a form of lowcarbon baseload generation nuclear will undoubtedly be part of the answer however as weve already seen with hinkley point c planning funding and building new power stations can be a long and costly process  it has taken over a decade to reach todays decision in the past year alone more than 5 gigawatts gw of coal power generation hinkley point c is set to provide 32 gw  has come off grid well before the governments target of 2025  we dont have the luxury of time every day lost adds to the cost of addressing this challenge gas will play a role but many including the institution of mechanical engineers imeche have pointed out the huge number of gasfired power stations well need to plug the gap that ending coal creates  imeche estimates 30 will be required which is clearly unrealistic since the uk has built just four in the last 10 years at drax we have developed a solution to these challenges  we have used state of the art technology to upgrade some of our coal facilities to generate electricity from biomass in place of coal these facilities are already providing a reliable and flexible flow of electricity that also helps the uk meet its carbon targets the biomass we use is compressed wood pellets which perform in much the same way as coal and deliver an 80 co 2 saving our biomass facilities are already powering three million homes and with the right support we can double this helping to plug the energy gap that old plant coming off and delays to new build will leave us with using biomass is more costeffective than other renewables this was illustrated by a recent study from imperial college and economic consultancy nera when they analysed the hidden costs of the backup needed to meet demand created by intermittent renewables  our biomass facilities can provide all of the electricity services required to keep the uk electricity system stable providing these services is set to become increasingly important in the years ahead as a greater need to backup and balance the system will be required finding the right mix of power generation will not be easy but it is important we make every effort to get it right like hinkley point c biomass is not a silver bullet but it can and must play its part in helping the country transform to a lowcarbon future  tags gas  energy policy  biomass energy sustainable biomass program  proving biomass is sustainable dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 14 april 2016 opinion i was honoured to be able to accept the excellence in bioenergy award recently not for myself but on behalf of all my colleagues at drax who have worked so hard to make a reality of our shared plan to generate reliable renewable electricity our achievements are truly a team effort in 2015 drax became a predominantly biomassfuelled power station we now generate more electricity at drax power station from compressed lowgrade wood pellets than from coal  between three and four per cent of the uks entire demand every day its a major triumph for all the brilliant engineers involved in converting the plant and everyone who has helped secure the incredibly complex supply chain that keeps it running but we truly believe that this is only the beginning for sustainable biomass sustainable biomass is the ideal fuel to help the world decarbonise in an affordable and reliable way it can support other renewables like wind and solar when the elements are against them and backup power is needed because it can be created by upgrading existing coalfired power stations it can be added to the electricity grid in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost of building new power stations why should the uk only build brandnew gas and nuclear power stations when existing coal power stations can be upgraded to low carbon renewable tech at drax we have shown how engineers working at what once was the biggest coal power station in western europe can use their expertise to work with compressed wood pellet power generation and it can save bill payers billions of pounds when the true costs of bringing other renewables on stream are taken into account the industrys greatest challenge right now is in proving that all the biomass we use is truly sustainable at drax we have proven the sustainability of the biomass we use time and time again but we can and will do more to ensure that standards right across the industry are always equally high we cannot underestimate the importance of sustainability no corners can be cut we must all join together and meet this challenge because without sustainable biomass there will be no industry at all without sustainable biomass in a balanced energy system with other renewables and low carbon technologies the paris climate change summit commitments may not be reached this is why the sustainable biomass program is so important the sbp has developed a certification framework to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources by working with the sbp all of us in the industry alongside hard working families and businesses stand to benefit which is why all of us at drax welcome its inception and look forward to working with the sbp to help build a growing and healthy industry that helps our society transition to the renewable fuels of the future may 2017 update the sbp has changed its name to the sustainable biomass program  you can
