draxs engagement with local education establishments is important to us as a good neighbour to communities and in bridging the emerging skills gap weve worked closely with nearby selby college to create a syllabus that will equip both current and future drax employees with skills for low carbon technologies including handson carbon capture usage and storage engineering across the uk decarbonising businesses must identify what skills their future employees will need and work with educators to deliver curriculums at drax we have a longlasting commitment to promoting science technology engineering and maths stem education in the yorkshire and humber region and beyond delivering the zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster initiatives means that we will need a highly skilled labour force to help us reach the regions goal of building the worlds first net zero industrial region  in practice this will create roughly 50000 new jobs in the region  requiring a workforce

pipeline and provide inspiration bruce heppenstall drax plant director lewis marron drax 4th year apprentice and liz ridley deputy principal at selby college one way were helping to develop the next generation of green economy colleagues is through our partnership with nearby selby college in 2020 we announced a 180000 fiveyear partnership with the college aimed at supporting education and skills last year we expanded our partnership even further and developed the uks first educational programmes dedicated to carbon capture working together we secured more than 270000 in funding from the government for the programme enabling the college to create a new training course in carbon capture usage and storage ccus technologies our engineers work closely with the college developing a syllabus that will equip both current and future drax employees with the vital skills needed to operate negative emissions technology this even includes a rig that mirrors the ccus equipment used in our bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot giving students the chance to work with real equipment rather than just the theory we believe that by showing students the kind of work we do onsite we can give them a deeper understanding of how we operate the department of education highlighted the success of our partnership as an example of how business and education can work together  something i believe is crucial to bridging the emerging low carbon skills gap the skills gap and future stem workers our work with selby college has highlighted the significant need to educate and upskill the uks workforce in low carbon technologies as quickly as possible although most organisations recognise the need to decarbonise they are uncertain about what they and their employees need to do to achieve this there are a lot of conversations about the need for green skills and reskilling employees in carbonintensive sectors but to put a real definition on whats needed is a lot harder every company must examine its business plan and try to unpick what skills they will need in 10 20 or even 50 years down the line  and in such a fast moving world this can prove to be a real challenge at drax were committed to building on our values  as an innovative and best in class place where we care about what matters we aim to do this by identifying training needs that are linked with new technologies beyond just beccs and working together with educators to make sure the relevant courses can either be distributed to other smes and large companies or adapted to help retrain people in other sectors our commitment to stem and education starts with young people and a handson curriculum delivered by our engineers to help support teachers we want to develop deeper more impactful education programmes that offer them multiple interactions with drax our engineers and operations throughout a persons education in my role you dont always see the immediate impact however when you

capture and storage  investors  customers  financial reports  biomass energy an introduction to carbon accounting 12 may 2022 sustainable business key takeaways tracking reporting and calculating carbon emissions are a key part of progressing countries industries and companies towards net zero goals as a newly established discipline carbon accounting still lacks standardisation and frameworks in how emissions are tracked reduced and mitigated the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol which lays out three scopes businesses should report and act upon carbon accounting evolves from reporting in the use of goals and timeframes in which targets are met timeframes are crucial in the deployment of technologies like carbon capture removals and achieving net zero how can countries and companies find a route to net zero emissions many organisations countries and industries have pledged to balance their emissions before midcentury they intend to do this through a combination of cutting emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere tracking and quantifying emissions understanding output reducing them and setting tangible targets that can be worked towards are all central to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  especially when it comes to carbon dioxide co 2  emissions and energy consumption reporting is already common practice and compulsory for businesses over a certain size in the uk however carbon accounting takes this a step further carbon reporting is a statement of physical greenhouse gas emissions that occur over a given period explains michael goldsworthy head of climate change and carbon strategy at drax carbon accounting relates to how those emissions are then processed and counted towards specific targets the methodologies for calculating emissions and determining contributions against targets may then have differing rules depending on which framework or standard is being reported against carbon accounting tools can help companies and counties understand their carbon footprint  how much carbon is being emitted as part of their operations who is responsible for them and how they can be effectively mitigated like how financial accounting may seek to balance a companys books and calculate potential profit carbon accounting seeks to do the same with emissions tracking what an entity emits and what it reduces removes or mitigates carbon accounting is therefore crucial in understanding how countries and companies can contribute to reaching net zero a new space how different organisations countries and industries approach carbon accounting is still an evolving process its as complex as financial accounting but with financial accounting theres a long standing industry that relies on wellestablished practices and principles carbon accounting by contrast is such a new space explains goldsworthy regardless of its infancy businesses and countries are already implementing standardised approaches to carbon accounting regulations such as emissions trading schemes and reporting systems such as streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr and the taskforce on climate related financial disclosure tcfd are beginning to deliver some degree of consistency in businesses carbon reporting other standards such as the ghg protocol have sought to provide a standardised basis for corporate reporting and accounting elsewhere voluntary carbon markets eg carbon offsets have also evolved to allow transferral of carbon reductions or removals between businesses providing flexibility to companies in delivering their climate commitments the challenge is in aligning these frameworks so that they work together for example emissions within a corporate inventory or offset programme must be accounted for in a way that is consistent with a national inventory to date these accounting systems have evolved independently with different rules and methodologies beginning to implement detailed carbon accounting upon which emissions reductions and removals can be based requires standardised understanding of what they are and where they come from reporting and tackling scope one two and three emissions the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol  this voluntary carbon reporting standard can be used by countries and cities as well as individual companies globally the ghg protocol categorises emissions in three different scopes called scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 understanding measuring and reporting these is a key factor in carbon accounting and can drive meaningful emissions reduction and mitigation scope one  direct emissions scope one emissions are those that come as a direct result of a company or countrys activities these can include fuel combustion at a factorys facilities for example or emissions from a fleet of vehicles scope one emissions are the most straightforward for an organisation to measure and report and easier for organisations to directly act on scope two  indirect energy emissions scope two emissions are those which come from the generation of energy an organisation uses these can include emissions form electricity steam heating and cooling a business may buy electricity for example from an electricity supplier which acquires power from a generator if that generator is a fossilfuelled power station the energy consumers scope two emissions will be greater than if it buys power from a renewable electricity supplier or generates its own renewable power the ability to change energy suppliers makes scope two relatively straightforward for organisations to act on assuming renewable energy sources are available in the area scope three  all other indirect emissions scope three is much broader it covers upstream and downstream lifecycle emissions of products used or produced by a company as well as other indirect emissions such as employee commuting and business travel emissions identifying and reducing these emissions across supply and value chains can be difficult for businesses with complex supply lines and global distribution networks they are also hard for companies to directly influence add in factors like emissions mitigations or offsetting and the carbon accounting can quickly become much more complex than simply reporting and reducing emissions that occur directly from a companys activities nevertheless these fullsystem overviews and wholeproduct lifecycle accounting are crucial to understanding the true impact of operations and organisations and to reach climate goals working to timelines setting goals with defined timelines and the development of rules that ensure consistent accounting is also crucial to implementing effective climate change mitigation frameworks throughout the global economy consider the uks aim to be net zero by 2050 or draxs ambition to be net negative by 2030 as goals with set timelines for many technologies the time scales over which targets are set have added relevance there are often upfront emissions to account for and operational emissions that may change over time take for example an electric vehicle the climate benefit will be determined by emissions from construction and the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power it a timeline of beccs at drax click to viewdownload looking at a brief snapshot at the beginning of its life say the first couple of years might not show any climate benefit compared to a vehicle using an internal combustion engine over the lifetime of the vehicle however meaningful emissions savings may become clear  especially if the electricity powering the vehicle continues to decarbonise over time this provides a challenge when setting carbon emissions targets targets set too far in the future potentially risk inaction in the short term while targets set over short periods risk disincentivising technologies that have substantial longterm mitigation potential delivering net zero some greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to fully abate such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture while other sectors like aviation will be incredibly difficult to fully decarbonise this makes carbon removal technologies all the more critical to ensuring net zero is achieved technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  which combines lowcarbon biomassfuelled renewable power generation with carbon capture and storage ccs to permanently remove emissions from the atmosphere  are already under development however it is imperative that such technologies are accounted for using robust approaches to carbon accounting ensuring all emission and removals flows across the value chain are accurately calculated in accordance with best scientific practice in the case of beccs its vital that not only are emissions from processing and transporting biomass considered but also its potential impact on the land sector forests from which biomass is sourced will be managed for a variety of reasons such as mitigating natural disturbance delivering commercial returns and preserving ecosystems accurate accounting of these impacts is therefore key to ensuring such technologies deliver meaningful reductions in atmospheric co 2 within timeframes guided by science accounting for net zero while carbon accounting is crucial to reaching a true level of net zero in the uk and globally where residual emissions are balanced against removals the practice should not be used exclusively to deliver numerical carbon goals to deliver net zero its vital we have robust carbon accounting systems and targets in place ensuring we reduce fossil emissions as far as possible while also incentivising carbon removal solutions says goldsworthy however many removal solutions rely on the natural world and so it is critical that ecosystems are not only valued on a carbon basis but consider other environmental factors such as biodiversity as well tags carbon capture  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  sustainability why and how is carbon dioxide transported 11 april 2022 carbon capture what is carbon transportation carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture projects in the uk read the full story of how carbon is captured transported and stored how governments can implement the policies needed to enable ccs at scale  tags carbon capture  negative emissions  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  engineering  technology what is the carbon cycle 25 march 2022 carbon capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are

points hydrogen as a fuel offers a carbonfree alternative for hardtoabate sectors such as heavy road transport domestic heating and industries like steel and cement there are several methods of producing hydrogen the most common being steam methane reforming which can be a carbonintensive process biomass gasification with ccs is a form of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs that can produce hydrogen and negative emissions  removing co 2 permanently from the atmosphere the development of both beccs and hydrogen technologies will determine how intrinsically connected the two are in a net zero future reaching net zero means more than just transitioning to renewable and low carbon electricity generation the whole uk economy must transform where its energy comes from to lowemissions sources this includes hardtoabate industries like steel cement and heavy goods vehicles hgvs as well as areas such as domestic heating one solution is hydrogen the ultralight element can be used as a fuel that when combusted in air produces only heat water vapour and nitrous oxide as hydrogen is a carbonfree fuel a socalled hydrogen economy has the potential to decarbonise hardtoabate sectors while hydrogen is a zerocarbon fuel its production methods can be carbonintensive for a hydrogen economy to operate within a net zero uk carbonneutral means of producing it are needed at scale and biomass energy from organic material  with or without carbon capture and storage in the case of beccs could have a key role to play in january 2022 the uk government launched a 5 million hydrogen beccs innovation programme  it aims to develop technologies that can both produce hydrogen for hardtodecarbonise sectors and remove co 2 from the atmosphere the initiative highlights the connected role that biomass and hydrogen can have in supporting a net zero uk producing hydrogen at scale hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe however it rarely exists on its own its more commonly found alongside oxygen in the familiar form of h 2 o because of its tendency to form tight bonds with other elements pure streams of hydrogen must be manufactured rather than extracted from a well like oil or natural gas as much as 70 million tonnes of hydrogen is produced each year around the world mainly to make ammonia fertiliser and chemicals such as methanol or to remove impurities during oil refining of that hydrogen 96 is made from fossil fuels primarily natural gas through a process called steam methane reforming of which hydrogen and co 2 are products without the use of carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus technologies the co 2 is released into the atmosphere where it acts as a greenhouse gas and contributes to climate change another method of producing hydrogen is electrolysis this process uses an electric current to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen molecules like charging an electric vehicle this method is only low carbon if the electricity sources powering it are as well for electrolysis to support hydrogen production at scale depends on a net zero electricity grid built around renewable electricity sources such as wind solar hydro and biomass however bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs offers another means of producing carbonfree renewable hydrogen while also removing emissions from the atmosphere and storing it  permanently producing hydrogen and negative emissions with biomass biomass gasification is the process of subjecting biomass or any organic matter to high temperatures but with a limited amount of oxygen added that prevents complete combustion from occurring the process breaks the biomass down into a gaseous mixture known as syngas which can be used as an alternative to methanebased natural gas in heating and electricity generation or used to make fuels through a watergas shift reaction the syngas can be converted into pure streams of co 2 and hydrogen ordinarily the hydrogen could be utilised while the co 2 is released in a beccs process however the co 2 is captured and stored safely and permanently the result is negative emissions heres how it works beccs starts with biomass from sustainably managed forests  wood that is not suitable for uses like furniture or construction  or wood chips and residues from these industries  is often considered waste in some cases its simply burnt to dispose of it however this lowgrade wood can be used for energy generation as biomass when biomass is used in a process like gasification the co 2 that was absorbed by trees as they grew and subsequently stored in the wood is released however in a beccs process the co 2 is captured and transported to locations where it can be stored permanently  the overall process removes co 2 from the atmosphere while producing hydrogen negative emissions technologies like beccs are considered essential for the uk and the world to reach net zero and tackle climate change building a collaborative net zero economy how big a role hydrogen will play in the future is still uncertain the climate change committees ccc 2018 report  hydrogen in a low carbon economy  outlines four scenarios these range from hydrogen production in 2050 being able to provide less than 100 terawatt hours twh of energy a year to more than 700 twh similarly how important biomass is to the production of hydrogen varies across different scenarios the cccs report puts the amount of hydrogen produced in 2050 via beccs between 50 twh in some scenarios to almost 300 twh in others this range depends on factors such as the technology readiness level of biomass gasification if it can be proven  technical work drax is currently undertaking  and at scale then beccs can deliver on the highend forecast of hydrogen production the volumes will also depend on the uks commitment to beccs and sustainable biomass the cccs  biomass in a low carbon economy  report offers a uk beccs hub scenario in which the uk accesses a greater proportion of the global biomass resource than countries with less developed carbon capture and storage systems as part of a wider international effort to sequester and store co 2  the scenario assumes that the uk builds on its current status and continues to be a global leader in beccs supply chains infrastructure and geological storage capacity if this can be achieved biomass and beccs could be an intrinsic part of a hydrogen economy there are still developments being made in hydrogen and beccs which will determine how connected each is to the other and to a net zero uk this includes the feasibility of converting hgvs and other gas systems to hydrogen as well as the efficiency of carbon capture transport and storage systems the cost of producing hydrogen and carrying out beccs are also yet to be determined the right government policies and incentives that encourage investment and protect jobs are needed to progress the dual development of beccs and hydrogen success in both fields can unlock a collaborative net zero economy that delivers a carbonfree fuel source in hydrogen and negative emissions through beccs tags innovation  hydrogen  technology  biomass energy  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage how is carbon stored 13 january 2022 carbon capture carbon storage is the process of capturing and trapping that co 2  this can occur naturally in the form of carbon sinks like forests oceans and soils that store carbon however it can also be manually carried out through technology one of the most wellestablished ways of storing carbon through the use of technology is by injecting co 2 into naturally occurring geological formations that can lock in or sequester the molecule on a permanent basis carbon storage is the final phase of the carbon capture usage and storage ccus process why do we need to store carbon global bodies like the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as well as the uks own climate change committee emphasise carbon capture and storage as crucial to achieving net zero emissions and meeting the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to within 15 o c this includes supporting forest growth through afforestation and reforestation  and other naturebased solutions to store carbon alongside ccus technology  the european commission also highlights ccuss role in balancing increased energy demand and continued fossil fuel use in the future with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent them entering the atmosphere how is carbon captured and transported to storage in naturally occurring examples forests and ocean fauna absorb carbon through photosynthesis when the vegetation eventually decomposes the carbon is sequestered into soil and seabeds carbon can also be captured from emissions sources such as factories or power plants the carbon is captured either precombustion where it is removed from the fuel source or postcombustion where it is removed from exhaust fumes in the form of co 2  the co 2 is then converted into a supercritical state where it has the viscosity of a gas but the density of a liquid meaning it can travel more easily through pipelines it can also be transported via trucks and ships but pipelines are the most efficient where can carbon be stored natural carbon sinks differ all over the world from peatlands in scotland to pacific coral reefs to the massive forests that cover countries like russia canada and brazil wooden buildings also act as carbon storage as they maintain the carbon within the wood for long time periods the co 2 captured by manmade technologies can also be stored in different types of geological formation unused natural gas reserves saline aquifers and unminable coal mines the north sea with its expansive layers of porous sandstone also offers the uk alone an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  if negative emissions technologies which actively remove emissions from the atmosphere were to capture and store the equivalent amount of co 2 as the 258 million tonnes expected to remain in the uk economy in 2050 it would take up just 036 of the available storage space years of research by the oil and gas industries mean many such geological structures have been mapped and are well understood all around the world carbon storage fast facts the international energy agency iea estimates that an accumulative 100 billion tonnes or 100 gigatonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit global warming to a 2 o c increase globally peatland soils contain more than 600 gigatonnes of carbon  exceeding the carbon stored in all other vegetation types including the worlds forests the united states geological survey estimates the country has a mean storage potential of 3000 gigatonnes of co 2 more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years over 25 million tonnes of captured carbon was permanently stored in sites across brazil norway and the united states in 2019 how is the carbon kept in place in naturebased carbon sinks the carbon does not always remain in one location in a forest for example trees and plants will hold carbon until the end of their lifetime after which they decompose releasing some co 2 into the atmosphere while some is sequestered into soil when co 2 captured through ccus is stored several things can happen to it in a geological storage site it can be caught in the minute intervening spaces within the rock through capillary action or trapped by a layer of impermeable caprock which prevents it from moving upwards co 2 may also dissolve in the water and then sinks as it is heavier than normal water the carbonated water reacts with basaltic rocks which cover most of the ocean floor the reaction releases elements like calcium magnesium and iron into the water stream over time these elements combine with the dissolved co 2 to form stable carbonate minerals that permanently fill pores within the rock how does co 2 enter the storage sites the co 2 is injected into the porous rocks of depleted or unused natural gas or oil reserves as well as saline aquifers  geologic strata filled with brine or saline water porous rock is filled with holes and gaps between the grains that make up the rock when co 2 is injected into these structures the co 2 floods the pores displacing the brine or remnants of oil and gas it then spreads out and is trapped in the domelike structures of the rock strata called anticlines how long can co 2 be stored appropriately selected and maintained geological reservoirs are very likely to retain 99 of sequestered carbon for more than 100 years and are likely to retain 99 of sequestered carbon for more than 1000 years according to the 2005 special report on ccs by the ipcc another study by nature found that more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years in natural carbon sinks the length of time that carbon is stored varies and depends on environments being preserved peatland for example builds up over thousands of years storing carbon however as peatlands degrade from attempts to drain them to create arable land as well as peat extraction for fuel they begin to emit co 2  the lifecycle of a tree by contrast is relatively short before it decomposes and releases some co 2 back into the atmosphere the ability for geological storage to contain co 2 for millennia means it can truly remove and permanently store emissions go deeper the history of carbon and how its removal can transform industries and help reverse climate change why carbon capture is pivotal to hitting climate goals what is carbon capture and storage  carbon capture and storage in the context of the british isles what are the challenges of storing co 2 in geological formations tags carbon capture  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  engineering  technology forests net zero and the science behind biomass 22 december 2021 sustainable bioenergy tackling climate change and spurring a global transition to net zero emissions will require collaboration between science and industry new technologies and decarbonisation methods must be rooted in scientific research and testing drax has almost a decade of experience in using biomass as a renewable source of power  over that time our understanding around the effectiveness of bioenergy its role in improving forest health and ability to deliver negative emissions has accelerated research from governments and global organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergys role in achieving net zero on a wide scale the european commission has also highlighted biomass potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy sustainably managed forests frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission in charge of the european green deal has emphasised its importance in bringing economies to net zero saying without biomass were not going to make it we need biomass in the mix but the right biomass in the mix the role of biomass in a sustainable future moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables supporting wind and solar by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels will require flexible sources of generation such as biomass as well as other technologies like increased energy storage  in the uk the climate change committees ccc sixth carbon budget report lays out its balanced net zero pathway in this lead scenario the ccc says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of co 2 or equivalent emissions mtco 2 e per year by 2035 increasing to 25 mtco2e in 2045 foresters in working forest mississippi biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity such as aviation shipping and industrial processes the cccs balanced net zero pathway suggest that enough lowcarbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 twh of nonelectric power in 2050  compared to the 1000 twh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today however bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks a report coauthored by ipcc experts examines the scientific literature around the climate effects principally co 2 abatement of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices the report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products including biomass that replace greenhouse gas ghgintensive fossil fuels and by storing carbon in forests and in longlived forest products the role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels the addition of carbon capture and storage ccs to bioenergy to create bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently the negative emissions made possible by beccs are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels beccs and the path to net zero the ipccs special report on limiting global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy  coupled with effective landuse that prevents it contributing to deforestation the second chapter of the report deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the midcentury bioenergy use is substantial in 15c pathways with or without ccs due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels however its the negative emissions made possible by beccs that make biomass instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios the ipcc report highlights beccs alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation ar that comes with sustainable forest management are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 15 o c graphic showing how beccs removes carbon from the atmosphere click to viewdownload there are two key factors that make beccs and other forms of emissions removals so essential the first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hardtoabate emissions negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of co 2 that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero the second reason beccs and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic co 2 emissions what makes co 2 such an important ghg to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other to help reach the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to below 15 o c removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential in the uk the cccs 2018 report  biomass in a lowcarbon economy  also points to beccs as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement it suggests that power generation from beccs will increase from 3 twh per year in 2035 to 45 twh per year in 2050 it marks a sharp increase from the 195 twh that biomass without ccs accounted for across 2020 according to electric insights data it also suggests that beccs could sequester 11 tonnes of co 2 for every tonne of biomass used providing clear negative emissions however the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and beccs is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that as a minimum requirement maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time with increased attention paid to forest management and land use there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a winwin solution that can decarbonise power and economies while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester co 2  how bioenergy ensures sustainable forests biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable climate beneficial or low carbon source of power uk legislation on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its longterm capacity to produce wood this is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from landuse changes such as urban creep where vegetated land is converted into urban concreted spaces depends on a healthy market for wood products industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higherquality wood while lowquality waste wood as well as residues from forests and woodindustry byproducts can be bought and used to produce biomass pellets  a report by forest 2 market examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the us south where drax sources about twothirds of its biomass the report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the us south instead it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the regions forests a synthesis report  which examines a broad range of research papers published in forest ecology and management in march of 2021 concluded from existing studies that claims of largescale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the south east us are not supported the use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net ghg greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels according to forest research  importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing in fact the opposite is true with annual wood growth in the us south increasing by 112 between 1953 and 2015  delivering a winwin solution the european commissions jrc science for policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report  the use of woody biomass for energy production in the eu suggests a winwin forest bioenergy pathway is possible that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term while at the same time not damaging or even improving the condition of forest ecosystems however it also makes clear loselose situations is also a possible in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policyrelevant timeframes winwin management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity a winwin future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse naturally regenerated and dedicated industrial forests the report also warns of tradeoffs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions or vice versa these must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a loselose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations while beccs fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions in a future that will depend on science working in collaboration with industries to build a net zero future continued research is key to ensuring biomass can deliver the winwin solution of renewable electricity with negative emissions while supporting healthy forests

sales and beccs as well as longterm dispatchable generation from biomass and pumped storage purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies which increasingly recognise the unique role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change strategic pillars to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets to be a global leader in negative emissions to be a leader in uk dispatchable renewable generation the development of these pillars remains underpinned by the groups continued focus on safety sustainability and biomass cost reduction a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets drax believes that the global market for sustainable biomass will grow significantly creating opportunities for sales to third parties in asia and europe beccs

5 and the coalition for negative emissions 6 have both outlined a clear role for beccs in delivering the negative emissions required to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels and to achieve net zero by 2050 identifying a requirement of between 2bn and 7bn tonnes of negative emissions globally from beccs separately the uk government has recently published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support beccs to meet these requirements subject to the right regulatory environment drax plans to transform drax power station into the worlds biggest carbon capture project using beccs to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 emissions from the atmosphere each year by 2030 the project is well developed the technology is proven and an investment decision could be taken in 2024 with the first beccs unit operational in 2027 and a second in 2030 subject to the right investment framework the group aims to build on this innovation with a new target to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions pa from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation the uks plans to achieve net zero by 2050 will require the electrification of heating and transport systems resulting in a significant increase in demand for electricity drax believes that over 80 of this could be met by intermittent renewable and inflexible lowcarbon energy sources  wind solar and nuclear however this will only be possible if the remaining power sources can provide the dispatchable power and nongeneration system support services the power system requires to ensure security of supply and to limit the cost to the consumer longterm biomass generation and pumped storage hydro can provide these increasingly important services drax power station is the uks largest source of renewable power by output and the largest dispatchable plant the group is continuing to develop a lower cost operating model for this asset supported by a reduction in fixed costs associated with the end of coal operations drax is also developing an option for new pumped storage  cruachan ii  which could take a final investment decision in 2024 and be operational by 2030 providing an additional 600mw of dispatchable longduration storage to the power system in its smart systems and flexibility plan july 2021 the uk government described longduration storage technologies as essential for achieving net zero and has committed to take actions to derisk investment for largescale and longduration storage capital allocation and dividend strategic capital investment 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity beccs at drax power station and cruachan ii is expected to be in the region of 3bn between 2022 and 2030 backed by longterm contracted cashflows and targeting high singledigit returns and above no final investment decision has been taken on any of these projects and both beccs and cruachan ii remain subject to further clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms the group believes these investments can be selffunded through strong cash generation over the period with net debt to adjusted ebitda significantly below 2x at the end of 2030 providing flexibility to support further investment such as
