power station world cup cuppas see great britains electricity demand surge great britain had to generate 1200mw of additional capacity to cope with the increased demand 4 july 2018 the nation breathed a collective sigh of relief after englands victory in the tense penalty shootout against colombia last night and what better way to celebrate than with a cup of tea at half time an additional 1200mw of electricity was required from national grid to cope with the number of kettles boiling lights being switched on toilets being flushed and pints being pulled the surge in demand was even greater than national grid expected and equated to almost half a million kettles being boiled demand surged to over 34400mw during the game last night  150mw more than national grid had anticipated however the spike in demand was successfully plugged  largely by gas generation one of the biggest surges in sporting history still goes to the world cup semi final in 1990  england v west germany the electricity demand was 2800mw  equivalent to 1120000 kettles being boiled after that fateful penalty miss the population made for the kitchen the match was watched by an estimated 26 million people in the uk when full time was called they caused a 2800mw surge in electricity demand the world cup quarter final of 2002  england v brazil  also saw an enormous spike broadcast early on a wednesday morning in the uk due to time differences with south korea where the game was played the match saw england put up a solid fight against overall tournament winners brazil a goal from michael owen provided early hope and at half time tv viewers left their screens to cause a huge 2570mw spike in demand by the time the game had reached its conclusion brazil had won thanks to a chipped ronaldinho free kick that fooled england keeper david seaman and those viewers who had lasted the duration caused a slightly smaller 2300mw surge ends media contact ali lewis drax group head of news e email
