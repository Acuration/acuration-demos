is a biomass wood pellet biomass is organic matter that can be used to generate energy it can include wood plant materials and even animal dung used to fuel fires for warmth and cooking 22 january 2021 sustainable bioenergy however by compressing organic matter like wood forest residues and sawdust into energydense pellets biomass can be used for heating or renewable bioenergy generation at a much greater scale why are pellets powerful the advantage of using biomass in the form of a pellet is its energy density this refers to the amount of energy that can be stored in a given amount of a material on their own the wood and residues like wood chips and sawdust that make up biomass do not have a high energy density a kilogram of wood for example stores little energy compared to fuels like coal diesel or uranium however by compressing forest industry residues into a pellet biomass becomes significantly more energy dense wood pellets can also have very low moisture content giving them a high combustion efficiency  an important feature in power generation how are biomass pellets made biomass pellets are made at a pelletisation plant  here wood that is unsuitable for other industries like sawmill residues are brought together the wood is chipped screened for quality heated to reduce its moisture content to below 12 and then converted into a fine powder this is then pressed through a grate at high pressure to form the solid short dense biomass pellet how are pellets used in power generation biomass pellets can be used to generate power in a similar way to coal allowing existing coal power stations to be transformed to use renewable bioenergy instead a conveyor system takes pellets from storage through to pulverising mills  where they are crushed into a fine powder that is then blown into the power stations boiler here the biomass is combusted as fuel the heat from this combustion is used to make steam which powers the generators that produce electricity biomass pellets density and uniform shape also makes them easier to transport and store in large quantities however it is essential that they are kept dry while in transit and that when stored in biomass domes the atmospheric conditions are carefully monitored and controlled to prevent unwanted combustion biomass pellet facts biomass pellets produce 80 less co 2 emissions when combusted than coal  as well as lower levels of sulphur chlorine nitrogen wood pellets have an energy density of 11 gigajoulesm 3  compared to 3 gigajoulesm 3 from fresh wood or wood chips according to the international renewable energy agency irena global wood pellet consumption for heating as well as power reached 35 million tonnes in 2018  excluding china when used in highefficiency wood pellet stoves and boilers biomass pellets can offer combustion efficiency as high as 85  are biomass pellets renewable when forests are sustainably managed and trees naturally regenerated or replanted and regrown in a human timeframe it makes the biomass pellets sourced from them renewable its vital for the longterm energy generation that biomass pellets are sourced from responsibly managed forests and other industries that protect the environment and do not contribute to deforestation sourcing decisions must be sciencebased and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon sustainable wood pellets are considered to be carbon neutral at the point of combustion as they grow forests absorb carbon from the atmosphere when a biomass pellet is combusted the same amount of atmospheric co 2 is released the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains neutral unlike with fossil fuels which release ancient carbon that has long fallen out of the natural carbon cycle because sustainable bioenergy is low carbon when its lifecycle emissions including supply chain co 2  are factored in it is possible to turn it into a source of negative emissions with the addition of carbon capture technology go deeper how as an oil crisis led an aviation engineer to develop biomass pellets the ports trains and domes that gets biomass where it needs to be  how a
