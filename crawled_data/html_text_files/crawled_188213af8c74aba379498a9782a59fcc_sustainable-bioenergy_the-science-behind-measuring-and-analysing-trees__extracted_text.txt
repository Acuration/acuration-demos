of drax reports energy and climate policy forests and biomass transport contact us the science behind measuring and analysing trees just how accurate is the data the drax forestry team investigates 12 march 2021 sustainable bioenergy we have published independent catchment area analysis caa reports for around 68 of the total biomass wood pellet supply to drax power station in 2019 within that 73 of the pellets were manufactured in the us south accounting for 49 of that years total supply quantity a key component of caa analysis are measurements data and calculations provided by the national forest inventory nfi bespoke wood price data mill production capacity market trends and interviews with local experts complete the picture the nfi in each country or region can be quite different in its intensity and frequency of measurement and overall degree of accuracy in this article we examine the forest inventory and analysis fia database produced by the us department of agriculture forest service usda fs fia traces its origin back to the mcsweeney  mcnary forest research act of 1928 and began the first inventory in 1930 since that time it has been in continuous operation with a stated mission to make and keep current a comprehensive inventory and analysis of the present and prospective conditions of and requirements for the renewable resources of the forest and rangelands of the us the fundamental science behind measuring tree height and diameter to calculate growth and volume has not changed much over the decades a girth tape is used to measure the diameter at breast height dbh which is a point on the tree stem 137m above the base of the tree or the root collar the exact height can vary by country the height of a standing tree is conventionally measured using a clinometer or hypsometer which measures the angle from the top of the tree to a measured distance away from the base this forms a triangle from which the tree height can be calculated dbh measurement using girth tape tree height measurement using clinometer example of girth and height measurement in the us south the combination of height and girth are then used to estimate total tree volume based on historical models for that particular species in that country or region many decades worth of data measurements and modelling have been used to develop complex equations to estimate volume for each species and circumstance this calculation process needs to estimate the rate of taper of the stem or the difference in diameter between the base and the top of the tree this can be consistent within a single species but it can depend on growth rates and planting density for example closely stocked trees may grow taller and thinner but more openly planted trees tend to be shorter and wider whether the site has been thinned  how many times and at what age can impact the degree of taper in the stem through many years of research measuring and modelling the southern research station srs fia team has developed the following formula for underbark volume calculation this is then modified according to the parameters shown below depending on species and stem characteristics example of volume once the volume has been calculated the basic density solid wood per cubic metre and moisture content can be used to calculate wet and dry weight fibre content and yield a comprehensive record of data the us forest service has built up an extensive historical record of data points through years of physical measurements  from both sampling and cutting down individual sample trees to determine the actual dimensions and statistics to compare against the estimated values over time forest scientists are able to build up reasonably accurate tables for each tree species that can be used to estimate growth and volume based on the dbh and estimated tree height in the uk we have a foresters handbook known as the blue book which contains a vast quantity of modelled data to help a forester calculate volume and growth in a range of different forest types across the country this data has been collected and modelled by the forestry commissions forest research branch  in the us they have a similar system of data collection and modelling but on a bigger scale given the much larger forest area and greater variety in tree species and site type how can you measure an entire forest the forestland area of the us south covers more than 100 million hectares ha in total which can present quite a challenge to measure survey and accurately predict forest growth and health the fia does this through a network of sample plots randomly but sequentially distributed across the forestland in each state with undisclosed locations so as to avoid biased management field crews collect data on forest type site attributes tree species tree size and overall tree condition on accessible forest land recently the programme has involved a fiveyear rolling measurement system where 20 of the plots are measured in each state on an annual basis at the end of a fiveyear period all plots will have been measured and the process begins again this process is overseen by a robust quality assurance system to maintain and ensure the quality and accuracy of the fieldwork plots are distributed at a rate of 1 plot per 6000 acres of land or one per 2400 ha this degree of plot distribution is at an extremely course scale if attempting to understand the growth of an individual stand or forest area for example the blue book recommends using 812 plots and top height measurements for a relatively uniform stand of around 10 ha this degree of accuracy would be required to calculate the volume of standing wood for sale in comparison the fia data would be completely inaccurate if trying to monitor growth and trends at an individual forest level or even at county level this sampling intensity and the scale of measurement are the most critical factors in assessing the validity of data and trends that are identified through the fia and through the caa analysis quantifying the level of accuracy the physical measurement procedure and volume modelling are well established processes with data and analysis collected over many decades to support the findings this leads to a clearly quantifiable degree of error for each measured plot the challenge comes when using plot data to estimate the values in the surrounding forest at this scale the level of accuracy will depend on the ratio of plots to total forest area and the total number of plots measured the ratio of plots per ha in the us south is predetermined limited by the physical and financial constraints of actually measuring trees on the ground however the total number of plots used to evaluate trends can vary according to how large an area is assessed fundamentally if a single county is assessed then the total number of sample plots will be low and the potential for error will be high if an entire state is assessed then the number of plots is much larger despite the same ratio of plots per ha therefore the data and the trend is statistically much more accurate draxs caa analysis falls somewhere in between these two points with each catchment area including multiple counties but not quite at the same scale as state level analysis an example of the variation in error is shown in the table below degree of error for key metrics in draxs caa analysis the data showing total inventory volume of wood growing in the forest has been assessed for the chesapeake catchment area in north carolina and virginia when looking at each individual county the data error calculation is  465 therefore not very accurate if looking at state level the data error is only  27 this degree of error is much more accurate and demonstrates more credible and reliable data due to the much larger number of plots available across the entire state the drax caa analysis for inventory in the chesapeake area is  47 which is reasonably close to the state level accuracy due to the large number of countries that are included in the caa analysis since the catchment area boundary is defined by the pellet mills historical and future sourcing pattern this can vary in size according to each mills procurement strategy and local market conditions for example the amite bioenergy pellet plant sources from a much smaller area close to the mill and therefore the catchment area includes fewer counties this can lead to a higher degree of error than in the other caa reports as the total number of plots used is smaller a long history of measurement and analysis despite this the overall degree of error is still in single figures and can be considered reasonable in each caa report by the standards of forest measurement and modelling an error of under 10 is generally considered acceptable measuring standing trees that are still growing is not an exact science  it is an estimation trees cannot be accurately weighed or measured until they are cut down therefore there will always be degree of error in estimated data in the us south the long history of measurement analysis and data modelling and the relatively homogenous nature of the main commercial species southern yellow pine mean that the error is relatively uniform and predictable if a large sample area is considered the potential for remote sensing data collection and analysis to replace traditional field measurement is an interesting and developing field at an individual forest or stand level it is possible to carry out intensive measurement with laser or lidar to calculate volume and growth however there is currently no reliable accurate and costeffective way to do this at a largescale across several million hectares this may be a possibility as the technology and data interpretation tools continue to develop and drax is working closely with remote sensing specialists to trial and develop this process until then we can rely on boots on the ground and traditional fieldwork for an accurate view of the forest trends across our supply chain this blog supports a series of catchment area analyses around the forest biomass pellet plants supplying drax power station
