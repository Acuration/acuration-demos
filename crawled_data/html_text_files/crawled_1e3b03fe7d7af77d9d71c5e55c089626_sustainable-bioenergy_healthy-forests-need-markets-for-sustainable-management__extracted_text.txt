healthy forests need markets using lowquality fuelgrade wood for biomass production makes commercial and environmental sense 26 august 2022 sustainable bioenergy view translated versions pdfs czech english french german italian polish spanish key takeaways misunderstandings about the role primary woody biomass plays in providing secure reliable and renewable power will have negative and material impacts across europe and around the world european parliament proposals to introduce a subsidy ban on utilising sustainably sourced harvesting residues are deeply flawed and will have negative impacts on europes energy security and climate targets biomass should not be sourced from highquality highvalue sawlogs eu policy making on primary woody biomass should ensure this is the case while being careful not to restrict good sources of biomass including harvesting residues and other byproducts generated during the sustainable management of forests for these higher value products forest thinning and regeneration harvests eg clearcuts generate lowvalue fibre that cant be used for solid wood products but that must be removed to ensure forests remain healthy and productive clearcutting is a wellaccepted regeneration technique used to encourage the redevelopment of forests which need full sunlight to grow this type of regeneration is particularly suited to maintaining certain forest types found in north america from where the eu receives 21 million tonnes of wood pellets a year biomass is the lowest value product coming from a forest harvest it does not dictate harvest practices and only uses byproducts without markets for lowgrade or lowvalue wood landowners struggle to manage healthy productive forests and the prevalence of pests disease forest fire and landuse change are increased introducing restrictions to reduce the use of primary woody biomass and clearcuts will not stop harvesting from taking place because harvesting is primarily driven by longlived solid wood product sectors instead such restrictions may result in a reduction in markets for the lowgrade byproducts of the timber industry that will in turn lead to forest degradation and loss biomass is the eus largest source of renewable energy by some distance in 2020 solid biomass  woodchips pellets and renewable waste materials  accounted for 40 of the final consumption of renewable energy solid biomass like wood pellets comes from lowgrade or lowvalue wood from actively managed working forests the sale of this wood provides a vital revenue stream for landowners practising sustainable forest management but proposed changes to the eus renewable energy directive red iii will lead to unintended consequences for sustainable forestry and the energy sector an incentive for active forest management the lowquality or lowvalue wood used by the biomass sector includes sourcing from practices like thinning  periodic felling of a proportion of the trees in a forest to promote healthy vigorous growth of the remaining trees thinning is an important element of active forest management fewer trees mean less competition for light water and nutrients so the remaining trees can reach sawtimbersize sooner increasing the landowners return on investment and contributing to longterm carbon storage in solid wood products thinning also improves forest health and biodiversity removing weaker and diseased trees which are more susceptible to disease and pest infestation contributes to a more resilient forest greater levels of sunlight hitting the forest floor stimulate a more diverse herbaceous layer which in turn supports a number of endemic wildlife species clearcuts are another common and important sustainable forest management practice it is a myth that the act of clearcutting is unsustainable clearcuts are an accepted regeneration technique used in europe and north america the practice is guided by science and mimics natural disturbance events such as wildfire and storm damage it is crucial for forest types which require full sunlight to regenerate and grow and helps prevent forest degradation that would otherwise occur if only weaker trees were left in the forest to regenerate in addition clearcuts regeneration plays a vital role in habitat diversity supporting a suite of species which thrive in this early successional habitat in many situations clearcuts set the stage for stronger forest regrowth and are essential for maintaining landscapelevel diversity clearcuts generate lowvalue fibre that cant be used for solid wood products but that must be removed to ensure forests remain healthy and productive click to viewdownload the european parliament proposals under red iii would confusingly put both valuable sawlogs and lowgrade wood under the eu classification of primary woody biomass the proposal would also place extreme restrictions around how energy produced using primary woody biomass is accounted for in progress towards renewable energy targets this will negatively impact the market for lowvalue wood and in turn reduce economic incentives to sustainably manage forests proposals to introduce a cap and phase down of this type of material will stunt the entire growth of the sector which is at odds to widely held views globally that demand for sustainable biomass will increase towards 2050 why markets matter without a market for lower quality or lower value wood there is less incentive to manage forests sustainably this increases the risk of pests disease and wildfire and compromises the longterm health of the forest wood that would be removed through thinning or final harvest for example may be left to rot on site or be burned in british columbia  forest owners must by law dispose of waste wood meaning millions of tonnes are burned releasing an estimated 3 million tonnes of co 2 a year into the atmosphere the biomass sector has long operated in europe and north america regions where deforestation is currently not a threat to working forests even with the sustained use of biomass which might become categorised as primary woody biomass through sustainable management the us south where drax sources around a
