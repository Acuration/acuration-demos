Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
“We have had a great first half of the year, transforming Drax into the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply company as well as the UK’s largest generator of renewable power.
“The business has performed well, and we have exciting growth opportunities to support the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner in the control room at Drax Power Station
“Drax has reduced its generation emissions by over 90%, and we are very proud to be one of the lowest carbon intensity power generators in Europe – a huge transformation for a business which less than a decade ago operated the largest coal power station in Western Europe.
“In the past six months we have significantly advanced our plans for Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the UK and globally. By 2030 Drax could be delivering millions of tonnes of negative emissions and leading the world in providing a critical technology needed to tackle the climate crisis.
“We are pleased to be announcing a 10% increase in our dividend, and we remain committed to creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.”

Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (write-down revaluation of deferred tax asset balances reflecting future increases in UK CT rates, acquisition costs, gain on sale of gas generation assets, restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements.
(3)
Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(4)
FSC License code: FSC-C119787.
(5)
Cost of production in Pellet Production – raw fibre, processing into a wood pellet, delivery to Drax port facilities in US and Canada, a loading to vessel for shipment to UK and overheads – Free on Board (FOB). Cost of ocean freight, UK port and rail cost reflected in Generation business accounts in addition to price paid to Pellet Production for the wood pellet.
(6)
CfD unit typically operates as a baseload unit, with power sold forward against a season ahead reference price. The CfD counterparty pays the difference between the season ahead reference price and the strike price. The result of this mechanism is that the CfD unit is expected to run a baseload or similar generation profile, meaning that the underlying expected level of generation is higher than that reflected in the contracted position table.
