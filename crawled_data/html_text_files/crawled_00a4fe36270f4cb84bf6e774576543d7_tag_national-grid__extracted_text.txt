national grid how to count carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 31 august 2020 opinion reduced demand boosted renewables and the neartotal abandonment of coal pushed last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions technologies such as beccs  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  read full report pdf  read full report  read press release electric insights q2

ancillary services ancillary services are a set of processes that enable the transportation of electricity around the grid while keeping the power system operating in a stable efficient and safe way why do we need ancillary services when electricity makes its way through the country it needs to be managed so that the power generation and electricity useage levels are equal the regulating of elements such as frequency and voltage has to be carefully managed so that the massive amounts of electricity moving  or transmitted  are able to be used safely in homes businesses schools and hospitals around the country ancillary services enable the power system to operate in a stable efficient and safe way what do ancillary services offer ancillary services include a wide variety of electrical efficiency and safety nets all focussed on ensuring the power system delivers enough output to meet demand yet remains stable frequency the uks power system runs at a frequency of 50 hertz  to stay balanced it has to remain at that frequency turbines and generators adjust the speed at which they spin automatically to increase or decrease power in line with demand and ensure that the system is kept stable voltage different parts of the uks transmission system use voltages of either 400 275 or 132 kilovolts to ensure that voltage remains within 5 of those figures at all times  to be safe for domestic electricity use power stations can produce or reabsorb excess energy as reactive power  keeping the overall system reliable inertia turbine use is important in keeping the system operating in its current state even with disruptions and sudden changes the electricity system uses the weight of heavy spinning turbines to create stability  acting as dampeners and smoothing out unexpected changes in frequency across the network reserve an important part of ancillary servicing is making sure that there are no surprises  so holding back power to release if something unexpected happens means that the network can function confidently knowing that there are generators and other power providers such as pumped hydro storage waiting ready to back it up who manages ancillary services in the uk the grids stability is managed by national grid electricity system operator eso  a separate company of national grid electricity transmission et  the eso works with ancillary service providers to either sign longterm contracts or make short term requests for a service these partners are often power stations such as drax power station which have large spinning turbines capable of controlling voltage frequency providing inertia and serving as a source of reserve power what is the future of ancillary services as we move to a more renewable system as the uks electricity system continues to change so to do its requirements for different ancillary services the switch from a few very large power stations to a greater variety of different electricity sources some of which may be dependent on the weather as well as changes in how the country uses electricity means there is a greater need for ancillary services to keep the grid stable these services have historically been delivered by thermal power stations but new innovations are enabling wind turbines to provide inertial response and overcome changes in frequency and batteries to store reserve power that can then be supplied to the power system to ensure balance ancillary services fast facts batteries can in some cases be cheaper ancillary alternatives to conventional sources of energy the hornsdale power reserve which runs on a tesla battery in south australia lowered the price of frequency ancillary services by 90 after just four months of use ancillary services usually work from habit knowing when to slow electricity production or increase supply based around the general publics standard working hours  dinner time and the early morning rush but during the covid19 lockdown  electricity consumption on weekdays fell by 13 and so national grid eso had to intervene with ancillary services to keep the lights on every year the esos ancillary services move 300 terawatt hours twh of electricity which is equal to 4 trillion kettles boiling at once  with recent innovations around renewable energies there are a wider variety of ways for ancillary services to generate power go deeper balancing for the renewable future ancillary services  greening the grid maintaining electricity grid stability through rapid decarbonisation renewable energy sources as a new participant in
