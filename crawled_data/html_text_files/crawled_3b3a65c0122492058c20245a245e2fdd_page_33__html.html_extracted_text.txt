Drax comments on COP26 announcement
9 August 2019
Press releases

A Drax spokesperson said:
“COP26 is an opportunity to show the world the UK’s ambitions for a net zero economy. If Drax scales up its ground-breaking bioenergy with carbon capture pilot, it could become the world’s first negative emissions power station, and the ‘anchor’ for the UK’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in the Humber region – creating clean growth, new jobs and export opportunities.
“Making the transition towards a zero-carbon economy is in everyone’s interests – it is fitting that COP26 could take place in such a forward-thinking city as Glasgow; a world leading hub for research, science and innovation.”

BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage)


Will Gardiner responds to IPCC report on land use
8 August 2019
Press releases

“At Drax we always source our biomass from sustainable forests which are growing and helping to improve the world’s carbon stocks. Our approach is aligned with the IPCC’s view about the importance of sourcing biomass sustainably, from well managed forests.
“The IPCC has confirmed that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is an essential technology in tackling the climate emergency the world is facing.  By scaling up our successful BECCS pilot, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station, producing flexible, renewable power at the same time as reducing the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere.”
For background:
Read more about Drax’s Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot
here
. Drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its pilot – once scaled up it would be capturing 40,000 tonnes of carbon a day from its four biomass generating units. That’s at a 90% capture rate.
If Drax can scale up its BECCS pilot it could create more opportunities for capturing and storing carbon dioxide from other industrial emitters in the Humber region, unlocking the potential to create a new hydrogen economy, creating jobs and delivering major environmental benefits globally.
Our
pioneering partnership
with Equinor and National Grid Ventures is exploring the potential for the Humber region to  transform itself and become the UK’s first cutting edge, zero carbon industrial cluster, helping to position Great Britain and the Humber region at the heart of the global energy revolution.
We also recently
announced
a new, innovative pilot project with Deep Branch Biotechnology, whose technology has the potential to capture carbon dioxide and use it to make proteins for fish food and other animal feeds. This could help the agricultural sector to become more sustainable by changing the way land is used to produce feeds.
Information about the sustainable biomass Drax uses is available on the

Doosan Babcock Celebrates 10 Years Safety Success at Drax Power Station
Press releases

The collaboration between the two companies dates back to the construction of the site in the early 1970s and more recently was cemented with the signing of a new long-term contract for maintaining and extending the life of the plant, which produces 7% of the UK’s electricity.
This milestone has been achieved while carrying out high intensity work over the past decade including 15 outages, year-round maintenance and a number of significant projects including the conversion of four coal units to biomass and other essential maintenance and life extension work.
Doosan Babcock CEO, Andy Colquhoun, joined the team on site to recognise and celebrate this major achievement. During his visit he commented:
“We have a long and proud history with Drax, from supplying the original boilers over 40 years ago, to supporting Drax as it transforms its business to meet the demands of the modern energy market. At Doosan Babcock safety is our number one value and this achievement is testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, which consistently delivers exceptional performance.”
Scott Anderson, Service Management Director at Doosan Babcock commented:
“This is a fantastic achievement from the Drax team, with DB & DPL working collaboratively to set very high safety and performance standards. The safety performance on site has been truly world class. This shows that our target of Zero Harm is definitely achievable.”
Andy Koss, CEO Generation at Drax commented:
“The health and safety of our staff and contractors is our number one priority – it is central to Drax’s operations and is reflected in the values and standards of our partners.
“Doosan Babcock’s support has been integral to Drax’s ongoing success as the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. The big projects they work with us on, such as maintenance outages, wouldn’t be possible without having the right policies and culture to ensure they are delivered safely.”
Background
Doosan Babcock has supported Drax throughout the full lifecycle in helping to build, maintain and extend the life of Drax Power Station. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the boilers, Doosan Babcock played a critical role in an unprecedented construction project which involved a workforce peaking at around 8000.
In 2003 Drax Power Station started co-firing biomass as a renewable energy alternative to coal. Doosan Babcock has supported Drax with research and development of biomass firing equipment through to the full project delivery of key technologies in this conversion process.
Drax’s biomass conversion project was one of the largest power plant modernisation programmes in UK history. Drax committed to transforming the business into a mainly biomass-fuelled generator using compressed wood pellets in place of coal.
During 2018, a fourth generating unit was converted from coal to use biomass – enabling Drax to generate more renewable power at the times the grid needs it the most. 94% of the power produced by Drax Power Station in the first half of 2019 was renewable, enough for four million households.
Drax also plans to repower its remaining two coal generating units to use high efficiency gas turbine technology and build up to 200MW of battery storage on site to provide additional flexibility. If these plans are approved, Drax could stop using coal as soon as 2023 – well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline for unabated coal to no longer be used in power generation. Doosan Babcock will continue to support Drax throughout this transition.

Renewables power Britain to new carbon emissions record
24 July 2019
Press releases

British power stations are producing 100 million tonnes less CO
2
per year than they were at the start of the decade
The amount of carbon being saved is equivalent to removing every single car and van off the UK’s roads or what would be required to fly everyone in the UK to Beijing and back.
On Sunday June 30 carbon emissions from electricity fell to just 97g per kWh, breaking the previous record of 104g per kWh set last summer, and for the first time ever meeting the UK Committee on Climate Change’s 2030 target of 100 g per kWh for a whole day.
June 30 was also the first ever day when more than half of Britain’s electricity was powered by renewables – 39% from wind, 9% from solar, 8% from biomass and 1% from hydro.
The changes seen on the power grid reflect a new record at the UK’s biggest renewable power generator.
Drax recorded a 52% reduction in its carbon emissions in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year
, with 94% of the power produced at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire being renewable. Drax Power Station is the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Imperial College London’s Dr Iain Staffell, who worked independently via Imperial Consultants to analyse Drax’s Electric Insights data, said:
“Britain’s power system is decarbonising at a faster rate than any other country in the world. We have spent more than half the summer without a single coal power station turned on, and renewables are breaking new records all the time.
“As a result our power stations are producing 100 million tonnes less CO
2
per year than they were just six years ago. The amount of carbon saved is equivalent to taking every single car and van off the UK’s roads, or what would be produced if every single person in the UK flew to Beijing and back.
“It’s fantastic progress, but we still have a long way to go to meet our net zero carbon targets. To make a real difference to the climate crisis, we must waste no time in using this low-carbon electricity to clean up our transport and buildings.”
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said:
“Drax is playing an important role in the energy transition – our carbon emissions in the first half of the year have halved compared to last year. With our biomass, pumped storage, hydro and gas power stations, we are generating more renewable, low carbon and flexible power to support the system as it continues to decarbonise.
“Having converted another generating unit at Drax Power Station to use biomass instead of coal last year, we’re now producing more renewable power at the times it is needed most – but we we’d like to go further.
“If we can scale up our successful bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station in the mid-2020s, helping to achieve the government’s net zero by 2050 carbon target.”
The clean record on June 30 was made possible by it being both a windy and a sunny, summer Sunday – when demand is often lower because less people are at work or school, and longer daylight hours and warmer temperatures means the need for electricity isn’t as high.
The carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity system on June 30 were 72% lower than the most carbon intensive day of the year, which was January 24 (347g per kWh). The difference amounted to 158,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide – equivalent to the CO
2
emitted by around 620,000 flights from London to Mallorca.
Data from Drax Electric Insights shows:
Fossil fuels supplied just 9.5% of electricity in the mid-afternoon on June 30 2019.
Renewables provided 55.3% of Britain’s electricity throughout the day – the previous record was 49.4% on September 21 2018.
June 2019 saw the lowest ever monthly demand, at 29.4 GW, beating the previous record of 29.6 GW from August 2017.

Editor’s Notes
Read the special Drax Electric Insights report:
Britain’s power system has never been closer to being fossil-free
On the British power system’s
most carbon intensive day
of 2019 so far (January 24) temperatures fell to below zero for much of the country and demand was at 41.6 GW. 71% of power came from fossil fuels.
Even the most carbon intensive day this year was only about half the carbon intensity of the highest seen on the grid on February 12, 2012, when it was
627g per kWh
.
The reduction in carbon intensity has been as a result of more renewables displacing coal on the electricity system.
Quarter 2 2019 saw the share of fossil fuel generation fall to its lowest ever level, dipping below 10% on May 26.
Drax Group’s carbon emissions reduced 52% from 265g CO
2
e/kWh in H1 2018 to 128g CO
2
e/kWh in H1 2019. This follows the conversion of a fourth generating unit to use biomass instead of coal in H2 2018 and a reduction in generation from coal.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that by 2050 85% of the world’s electricity will come from renewables like wind and solar – with the remaining 15% coming from flexible technologies, like biomass, gas and pumped storage, which are able to deliver the essential support services the grid needs to maintain secure supplies.
In January Drax Group completed
the acquisition
of a portfolio of renewable, low-carbon and flexible power stations, in strategic locations across the country – from Scotland to the South East coast.
Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire is the UK’s largest power station and the country’s biggest renewable electricity generator.
Since converting two thirds of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, it is producing enough renewable electricity for four million households and delivering carbon savings of more than 80%.
If Drax is able to scale up its
successful bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot
project to become the world’s first negative emissions power station, it would be reducing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the same time as producing flexible, renewable power which supports grid stability.
According to the UK’s Committee on Climate Change – the use of BECCS and achieving negative emissions will be crucial to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The UK Committee on Climate Change and National Grid in its Future Energy Scenarios report both concluded that if we are to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the electrification of heat and transport will lead to increased demand for power.
Drax has
announced a partnership
with National Grid Ventures and Equinor to explore the potential in the Humber region for developing the UK’s first net zero industrial cluster, using CCS and hydrogen.

Secondary pupils learn new skills at Drax
23 July 2019
Press releases

15 -year-old students rose to the challenge of becoming tour guides at the UK’s biggest power station as part of an initiative aimed at boosting skills.
Year 10 pupils from Holy Family Catholic High School in Carlton, near Selby, put their public speaking and presentation skills to the test when they became the latest recruits to the Visitor Centre team at Drax Power Station – the UK’s biggest renewable power generator.
The school has been participating in the Diana Award Mentoring Scheme, which pairs volunteer mentors from industry with young people to give them an insight into the world of work and career skills training.
Through weekly group sessions, the students worked with the Drax visitor centre team on skills including project planning, critical thinking and interview techniques.
Holy Family Catholic High School students
Danny Devlin, Careers Lead and Physics teacher at Holy Family School who led the project said:
“The programme has been a massive success and the students have gained so much from it.
“One skill the students identified as something they’d like to improve was public speaking and presentation skills, and what better way to practice this than to explain how Drax works?
“The experience has been invaluable to them – they have really grown in confidence. None of it would have been achieved without the excellent support and guidance from the staff at Drax.”
Research for the Northern Powerhouse Partnership has shown that students in the north are falling behind their counterparts in other parts of the country when it comes to education and skills – highlighting the need for employers to do more to help inspire pupils and ensure the region has the skilled workforce it needs to succeed
Jane Breach, Visitor Centre and Communities Manager at Drax said:
“It’s been really rewarding to work with Holy Family School as mentors, and see the students grow in confidence. This exercise helped the students to develop a valuable skill, and we are delighted to support the programme as part of our commitment to STEM learning in the area.
“Providing these kinds of inspirational opportunities for students where they get the chance to work with people in industries like ours are so important – it opens up a whole range of new possibilities for them – and contributes to ensuring the next generation has the skills employers like Drax needs.”
Drax’s commitment to STEM learning includes running a long-established apprenticeship scheme – it has doubled the number of apprentices it is taking on this year compared to two years ago and has reinstated an
apprentice scheme at its new power stations in Scotland
.
It has also invested in a new initiative with local schools and colleges through the GreenPower project which provides
students with EV kit cars to build and race aimed at inspiring them to study STEM subjects.

Drax Group launches apprenticeship scheme at Scottish sites
18 July 2019
Press releases

Five placements will be introduced this year across the Galloway Hydro scheme, Cruachan Power Station and the Daldowie Treatment Works – locations which were acquired by Drax in January 2019.
Part of Drax’s commitment to developing the next generation of talent in the sector, the four-year training schemes will be the first to be introduced at the Scottish sites since they became part of Drax Group and will see successful applicants join in August.
The move is the latest bid to encourage young people into science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) careers by Drax, which owns the UK’s biggest single site renewable generator in the form of Drax power station in North Yorkshire.
Andy Koss, CEO Generation at Drax Group said:
“We have always regarded apprentices as key to the success of our business. The launch of our apprenticeship training programme in Scotland will allow us to tap into the pool of talent across Scotland, as well as with our apprenticeship scheme at Drax Power Station.
“We want to help young people from all backgrounds achieve their aspirations and develop the skills they need to go far in this sector. Working for Drax, they will be with a company which is leading the way in developing innovative technologies to help the UK achieve its net zero target and enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.”

Successful applicants for the Scottish apprenticeships will be based at the East Kilbride Group Training Association for the first year of apprenticeship. The apprentices will then spend the next three years working at Galloway, Cruachan or Daldowie.
All five will have the opportunity to learn from experienced colleagues at each of the sites and, at the end of the placement, will have the chance to qualify at an SVQ Level 3 and a Higher Certificate in either of Mechanical, Electrical or Multi-Disciplined Engineering.
As well as its long-established apprenticeship scheme, Drax also sponsors a number of PhDs at Sheffield University and works closely with schools across the Selby district as it continues to promote the importance of STEM skills in the UK.
In July, Drax announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Equinor and National Grid Ventures committing all three organisations to explore how a large-scale carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) network and a hydrogen production facility could be constructed in the Humber by the mid-2020s.
In February, Drax confirmed that its ground-breaking trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), using technology developed by Leeds-based C-Capture, had become the first project of its kind in the world to capture CO
2
from a 100% biomass feedstock.

Will Gardiner comments on National Grid Future Energy Scenarios report
11 July 2019
Press releases

“Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is essential for us to achieve net zero by 2050. We now need a framework to bring forward investment in and development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies and a mechanism which recognises and supports negative carbon emissions.
“Drax is already capturing one tonne of CO2 a day from its ground-breaking BECCS pilot. With the right regulatory and investment framework we could scale it up to become the world’s first negative emissions power station, creating opportunities for clean growth, new jobs and export opportunities within a zero carbon hydrogen economy across the Humber region.”

Drax and Selby District Council team up to tackle plastic waste
9 July 2019
Press releases

The ‘bottle exchange’ is allowing Selby students and residents to swap their single-use plastic bottles for a free reusable water bottle.
The scheme kicked off at Selby College with over 200 bottles being exchanged at the first session and will be rolled out at Selby High School next week, along with other locations across the District, which are open to residents to use.
Approximately 13 billion plastic bottles are used each year in the UK, but only 7.5 billion are recycled.
Selby District Councillor and Executive member Chris Pearson said:
“Reusable water bottles are convenient and environmentally friendly – and using one is cheaper than constantly buying single use water bottles. This initiative supports our existing network of free water bottle refill points which is supported by lots of local businesses in the Selby district.”
Drax Group Head of Sustainable Business, Vicky Bullivant, added:
“Too many of the plastic bottles used in the UK go to landfill – more than five billion each year, and they take around 450 years to biodegrade. We want to help change that and are proud to be part of a scheme which will help to reduce single use plastics in Selby.
“Reusable water bottles are an easy and convenient way to stay hydrated on the go, and also can replace single use plastic bottles.”
Local residents can get involved too, with water bottle exchanges available at a number of locations around the area, including:
The Summit Indoor Adventure, Scott Road, Selby
Regen Centre, Riccall
Tadcaster Town Council
Tadcaster Library
Tadcaster Pool
Barlby Library and Community Hub
Selby Library, Micklegate, Selby
SDC Contact Centre, Market Cross, Selby
All single use water bottles exchanged as part of the project will be recycled.

About Drax
Drax Group’s ambition is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,600-strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies six percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
B2B supply:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
