2019 power generation tags drax power station  electric vehicles evs  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  flexibility and stability and power system security  investors  national grid  power station  smart grid in energy storage timing is everything 21 august 2019 power generation electricity is unlike any other resource the amount being generated must exactly match demand for it around the clock managing this delicate balancing act is the job of the national grid electricity system operator eso which works constantly to ensure supply meets demand and the grid remains balanced  one of the ways it does this is by storing energy when there is too much and deploying it when there is too little although there are many different ways of storing energy at a small scale at grid level it becomes more difficult one of the few ways it is currently possible is through pumped hydro storage cruachan power station in the highlands of scotland is one of four pumped storage facilities in great britain it uses electricallydriven turbines to pump water up a mountain into a reservoir when there is excess electricity on the grid and then releases the water stored in the reservoir back down to spin the same turbines to generate power when its needed quickly the dual capabilities of these turbines are unique to pumped hydro storage and contribute to the overall grids stability however what dictates when cruachans turbines switch from pump to generate and vice versa is all a matter of what the grid needs  and when the switch from pump to generate while the machine hall of cruachan power station is an aweinspiring place for its size and location 396 metres beneath ben cruachan it generates electricity much like any other hydropower station harnessing the flow of water to rotate any number of its four 100 megawatt mw turbines this mode  simply called generate mode  is usually employed during periods of peak power demand such as mornings and evenings during a major national televised event  or when wind and solar energy output drops below forecast as a result starting up and generating millions of watts of electricity has to be fast it takes just two minutes for a turbine to run up from rest to generate mode says martin mcghie operations and maintenance manager at the power station it takes slightly longer for the turbines to run down from generate to rest but whatever function the turbines are performing they can reach it within a matter of minutes the reverse of generate mode is pump mode which changes the direction of travel for the water this time using electricity from the grid to pump water from the vast loch awe at the foot of ben cruachan to the upper reservoir where it waits ready to be released in contrast to generate mode pump mode typically comes into play at times when demand is low and there is too much power on the system such as during nights or at weekends when there is excessive wind generation  however the grid has evolved since cruachan first began generating in 1965 and this has changed when it and how it operates in the early days cruachan was used in a rather predictable way pumping overnight to absorb excess generation from coal and nuclear plants and generating during daytime peak periods says martin the move to more renewable energy sources like wind mean overall power generation is more unpredictable he continues there has also been a move from cruachan being primarily an energy storage plant to one which can also offer a range of ancillary services to the grid system operator the benefits of spin mode in between pumping water and generating power cruachans turbines can also spin in air while connected to the grid neither pumping not generating this is essentially a standby mode where the turbines are ready to either quickly switch into generation or pumping at a moments notice they spin one way for spin pump the other for spin generate these spin modes are requested by the eso to ensure reserve energy is available to respond rapidly to changes on the grid system in spin generate mode the generator is connected up to the grid but the water is ejected from the space around the turbine by injecting compressed air the turbine does not generate power but is kept spinning allowing it to quickly start up again as soon as the grid has an urgent need for power the air is released and the water from the upper reservoir flows into the turbine to begin generation in under 30 seconds spin pump works on the same basis as spin generate but with the turbine rotating in the opposite direction ready to pump at short notice this allows cruachan to absorb excess generation and balance the system as soon as the eso needs it the use of spin mode by the eso is highly variable and dependant on a number of factors eg weather conditions or the state of the grid system at the time says martin this unpredictability of the increasingly intermittent electricity system makes the flexibility of cruachans multiple turbines all the more important ready for the future grid its not only the types of electricity generation around the system that are changing how cruachan operates martin suggests that the way energy traders and the eso use cruachan will continue to evolve as the market requirements and opportunities change technology is also changing the market and martin predicts this could affect what cruachan does in the future we will face competition from alternative storage technologies such as batteries electric vehicles  as well as competition for the other ancillary services we offer however cruachans flexibility to generate absorb or spin in readiness means it is prepared to adjust to any future changes cruachan is always ready to modify or upgrade to meet requirements as we have done in the past says martin the priority is always to be able to deliver the services required by the grid system operator  in characteristic quick time visit

last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important

size of a mountain 11 march 2019 power generation whats the biggest battery you can think of a car battery a gridscale lithiumion array what about a battery the size of a mountain thats what youll find on the banks of loch awe in argyll scotland cruachan power station is a pumped hydro storage facility comprised of nearly 20 km of tunnels and chambers cutting through the mountain of ben cruachan built in the 1960s the site known as the hollow mountain entails a subterranean power station a reservoir a dam and the loch itself these components all work together to store a huge amount of energy or enough to power more than 880000 homes at a moments notice this probably doesnt fit your image of what a battery looks like but the principle is the same the purpose of any battery from the aas in your remote control to the one in your phone that you charge every night is to store power for future use in an aa battery that storage takes the form of chemicals within the battery which release electricity under the right conditions in pumped hydro the purpose is the same but instead of being stored in chemicals that energy is stored in the gravitational potential energy of 10 million cubic meters of water sitting poised to spin cruachans turbines and generate 440 megawatts mw of electricity such a huge amount of water is the equivalent of around seven gigawatthours gwh of energy if the reservoir is full the hollow mountain can power a city for more than 15 hours how pumped hydro works cruachan power station is one of only four such storage facilities in the uk inside the mountain 396 metres beneath the surface is a chamber about the size of a football pitch and the height of a sevenstorey building here sit four electricitygenerating turbines each weighing around 650 tonnes a series of tunnels and channels connect these turbines to two enormous bodies of a water loch awe at the base and the ben cruachan reservoir further up the mountain the turbines can function both as pumps and as generators when there is an excess of power on the grid and electricity is cheap the turbines consume electricity and work to pump water up from the loch below to the reservoir 300 metres above then when electricity demand rises the turbines reverse direction now the water flows down from the reservoir and through the turbines which switch to generating electricity and supply it to the grid this is an extremely quick process unlike coal or nuclear stations which can take hours to get up to full capacity cruachan can go from standstill to generating within two minutes  perfect for reacting to variance in grid demand at short notice httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 often national grid eso electricity system operator keeps one or more of cruachans four units spinning in air compressed air is used to evacuate water from around a turbine to allow it to spin when necessary it can go from zero megawatts to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds in any given day the system operator may call on cruachan power station multiple times as the requirements to manage the grid constantly change cruachan is a net generator of power across the year thanks to the large amount of water flowing into its reservoir from a system of aqueducts however pumped hydro is primarily about storing energy  not actively producing it in the way wind solar gas biomass or conventional hydropower facilities might in fact the uks four pumped hydro power stations are a combined net consumer of electricity but this is the case with regular batteries as well when construction is factored in nevertheless pumped hydro storage is still efficient  around 70 to 80 of the electricity used in pumping is recovered in generation sometimes the convenience of getting access to power when its needed is more valuable than how much power is conserved the need for storage but why store so much energy in such an improbable location to begin with there are two key reasons the first is that the grid doesnt operate under the same conditions all the time great britain will use more or less electricity owing to its needs for example overnight there is a lower demand than at 5pm on a weekday evening this means sometimes the grid is demanding more electricity than is being supplied and sometimes vice versa secondly theres the increasing level of intermittent energy sources like wind and solar supplying low carbon electricity these sources are highly dependent on the weather and cant be easily turned up or down in response to grid conditions batteries can address these two issues in times of higher electricity supply than demand storage systems can absorb and store electricity from the grid which helps balance frequency and prevent surges and in times of high demand then can quickly deliver electricity where its needed pumped hydro is an important part of this equation  in fact while other types of gridscale batteries are receiving significant investment they are still in their infancy pumped storage by contrast already accounts for 95 of all installed storage capacity in the world around 130 gw what does the future hold for pumped hydro one of the challenges in installing more pumped hydro storage is finding suitable geography  places which are both mountainous with nearby suitably large bodies of water however there have been experiments into river and tidalbased pumped hydro storage projects senator wash dam on the colorado river uses pumping to store water upstream from the imperial hydropower dam so it can be released when needed while the rance tidal power station in france pumps sea water behind the barrage to allow it to start up faster storage solutions will become more important as electricity systems increasingly move towards renewable and low carbon sources pumped storage helps to meet peaktime demand and provide grid stability by making use of the landscape and gravity to deliver electricity when its needed guided tours of cruachan the hollow mountain are available via visitcruachancouk tags electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy storage  hydroelectric power three things last summer tells us about great britains electric future 7 november 2018 power generation great britains electricity system has had its robustness tested at both ends of the thermometer in 2018 first the onceinadecade low temperatures of the  beast from the east saw electricity demand reach its highest peak in three years on 1 march as the country turned on electric heaters and extra lighting following fast on its heels was an unusually hot dry and still summer that pushed demand up by the equivalent of adding a second scotland to the system  and required solar generation to make up for a wind drought and all of this happened in the first half of the year so far the second half of the year has seen fewer instances of freak weather which has meant fewer peaks in the power system while uneventful in this sense the last quarter of great britains power does go some way towards showing us what we might expect from the system in the future the findings come from electric insights  an independent report written by researchers at imperial college london and commissioned by drax that analyses the countrys power and hints at what we might expect in the future breaking renewable records will get boring quarter after quarter great britain breaks new renewable records and q3 2018 was no exception the threemonth period from july through september saw total capacity of renewable sources exceed fossil fuels for the first time great britain now has 406 gigawatts gw of gas coal diesel and oilfired power generation capacity compared to 419 gw of capacity from wind solar biomass hydro and waste sources to put this into perspective at the start of the decade fossil fuel capacity was seven times that of renewables since 2010 renewables have grown sixfold wind passed 20 gw of installed capacity in september and is now the countrys largest renewable source solar has slowed in growth but remains the second biggest renewable with 13 gw of capacity biomass is now the third largest source of renewable electricity thanks to the coaltobiomass conversions of lynemouth power station and draxs unit 4  which together added 1 gw more renewable electricity to the system along with these conversions a quarter of the countrys coal capacity retired in the last year leaving just six generators in operation while this shift to renewables is helping decarbonise great britains power system the increasing intermittency that comes with it means balancing the grid is becoming more complicated read the full article coauthored by luke clark at renewableuk renewables leapfrog fossil capacity as balancing the network becomes more complex it could grow more expensive the daily cost of running the transmission system  which manages the flow of electricity from generators to consumers  has doubled over the last four years this growth has been steady since 2010 but q3 2018 saw the cost reach onesixth higher than the previous record in q3 2017 over this quarter balancing the system on average cost 38 million per day with three days seeing costs exceed 10 million in turn adding 6 to the overall wholesale price of electricity part of the reason for the increased costs is that need for balancing services such as voltage control reserve power and frequency response spike when there are high levels of intermittent renewables such as wind and solar on the system as this type of generation cant be perfectly calculated it is important for national grid to ensure there are flexible reserve sources running to plug gaps and help move electricity around the grid  both of which incur balancing costs for example in september balancing costs spiked several times as a result of increases in wind power the rising price highlights that for the grid to function its not just a matter of generating enough electricity to meet demand where and when it is generated is as important to maintain its stability and with everincreasing levels of intermittent renewables the need for stabilising services will grow read the full article the cost of staying in balance the cost of generating electricity may rise which will have knock on effects its not just balancing costs however that are driving up the cost of electricity dayahead market prices have risen by 50 over the last year  from an average of 42mwh in q3 2017 to 60mwh last quarter this was not the result of spikes caused by events such as the beast from the east or the summers world cup final but by a gradual creeping up of prices caused by a combination of increasing gas prices and carbon emissions costs as well as a weaker pound in the wake of ongoing brexit negotiations gas power stations are six times more influential on power price than any other generation technology but with global gas prices rising 50 the countrys primary source of flexible generation is becoming costlier the knock on effect of this 10year high gas price was not only an impact on consumers pockets but also a resurgence in coal which became cheaper than gas and led to a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation for a period during the quarter  adding to this the european emissions trading scheme ets increased the price of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by a factor of four over the past 12 months pushing up the cost of wholesale electricity even further the international nature of the electricity system also makes prices vulnerable to currency fluctuations and a weakening pound made the impact greater the currency devaluations following the eu referendum are continuing to contribute to this and ofgem found it caused an 18 increase in electricity prices  this isnt the referendums only effect if the uk leaves the eu next year under a nodeal scenario the country would also exit the ets removing a component of the current total carbon price there are plans to replace this with a new tax adding to the existing uk carbon price support cps but this would only come into effect from april 2019 leaving q1 with just the cps  effectively making it cheaper to emit carbon during that threemonth period which in turn adds a risk of more carbonintensive sources becoming more economically viable than renewable sources while there is little great britain can do to influence international fuel prices it can alter domestic policies to influence the price for consumers making heavily emitting fuels economically prohibitive and incentivising more lower carbon and renewable sources onto the system can reduce dependency on imported fuels and cut carbon costs read the full article wholesale power prices hit a 10year high explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report  commissioned by

ccgt in blackburn 60mw and a 50k tonne biomassfromwaste facility in daldowie which benefits from a firm offtake contract agreement with scottish water until 2026 benefits of the acquisition a leading provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility increased earnings potential aligned with generation strategy and uk

acquisition the following is a summary of the principal terms of the acquisition agreement acquisition agreement parties and consideration the acquisition agreement was entered into on 16 october 2018 between drax smart generation and the seller pursuant to the acquisition agreement the seller has agreed to sell and drax smart generation has agreed to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of spgen for 702 million subject to certain customary adjustments in respect of cash debt and working capital drax group holdings limited has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of drax smart generation under the acquisition agreement scottish power uk plc has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of the seller under the acquisition agreement conditions to completion the acquisition is conditional on the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules the shareholder approval condition and the cma having indicated that it has no further questions at that stage in response to precompletion engagement by drax or the cma having provided a decision that the acquisition will not be subject to a reference under the uk merger control regime completion is currently expected to occur on 31 december 2018 assuming that the conditions are satisfied by that date termination for material reduction in available generation capacity drax smart generation has the right to terminate the acquisition agreement upon the occurrence of a material reduction in available generation capacity at any of the cruachan galloway and lanark or damhead creek facilities which subsists or is reasonably likely to subsist for a continuous period of three months the right of drax smart generation to terminate in these circumstances is subject to the sellers right to defer completion if the relevant material reduction in available generation capacity can be resolved by end of the month following the anticipated date of completion break fee a break fee of 146 million equal to 1 of draxs market capitalisation at close of business on the day before announcement is payable if the shareholder approval condition is not met save where this is as a result of a material reduction in available generation capacity as described above precompletion covenants the seller has given certain customary covenants in relation to the period between signing of the acquisition agreement and completion including to carry on the spgen business in the ordinary and usual course the seller will carry out certain reorganisation steps prior to completion pension liabilities drax smart generation has agreed to assume the accrued defined benefit pension liabilities associated with the employees of the spgen group as at the date of signing the acquisition agreement following completion the spgen group will continue to participate in the sellers group defined benefit pension scheme known as the scottishpower pension scheme spps for an interim period of 12 months unless agreed otherwise the interim period while a new pension scheme is set up by the spgen group for the benefit of its employees the new scheme at the end of the interim period the spps trustees will be requested to transfer from the spps to the new scheme an amount of liabilities and corresponding share of assets agreed between the seller and drax smart generation or failing agreement an amount determined by an independent actuary in respect of the past service liabilities relating to the spgen group employees if the amount of assets transferred to the new scheme does not match the amount agreed or independently determined there will be a trueup between the seller and drax smart generation if the spps trustees do not make any transfer to the new scheme within the period of 18 months following the interim period unless this was caused by a breach of the acquisition agreement by the seller drax smart generation has agreed to pay 16 million plus base rate interest to the seller as compensation for the spps liabilities not taken on by the new scheme sellers warranties indemnities and tax covenant the seller has provided customary warranties in the acquisition agreement the seller also has provided drax smart generation with indemnities in respect of certain specific matters including for any losses associated with the reorganisation referred to above a customary tax covenant is also provided in the acquisition agreement transitional services agreement the seller and spgen will enter into a transitional services agreement effective at completion the specific nature terms and charges relating to the services to be provided will be agreed between the seller and spgen prior to completion the seller will also provide assistance in relation to the extraction and separation of the spgen group from the systems of the seller and integration of the spgen group onto the systems of the drax group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material change from the historical 10year average rainfall there are no material adverse events that have a significant impact on the financial performance of any of the acquired assets including any more unplanned outages than would be expected in the ordinary course prior to completion the business will be operated in the ordinary course there are no material issues with the transitional services provided by scottish power to drax pursuant to the tsa including the migration of such services to drax there is no material change in the management or control of the drax group end tags biomass

gardiner chief executive officer drax group 1 october 2018 opinion the uk has come a long way in its efforts to decarbonise greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43 below 1990 levels  while increasing renewable electricity generation and a strengthening carbon price means the country could soon go coalfree for an entire summer  there is still however much work needed to reach the uk target of reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the paris agreements aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius as ambitious as these goals may be recent research by the energy transitions commission etc believes they can be met by 2050 with the right government policies and action from businesses to help to mitigate man made climate change all industries across all sectors must cut carbon emissions its a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation this step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation transforming what was once western europes largest coalfired power station into the uks biggest decarbonisation project this puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed  across the electricity industry and other sectors  to reach a zerocarbon world electricity generation will lead decarbonisation the electrification of carbonintensive sectors such as transport and heating will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zerocarbon sources the etcs research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85 of the worlds electricity generation by 2050 when these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15 will come from a combination of nuclear hydro biomass and storage including batteries pumped storage and new technologies in fact biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15 but it is critical that this flexible renewable low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced for the wood biomass we use at drax power station its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests which will be another key part of the climate change solution will gardiner ceo drax group at drax we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of our own biomass pellet supply chain  from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading the skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chainbased industries along the path to lowercarbon emissions more than this it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this from here to zerocarbon one of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage were leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a sixmonth pilot of a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs system which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four 600 megawatt mw biomass units capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds but also opens new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon  for drax beccs takes us another step towards becoming a carbon negative operation  where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit it is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which will be essential in meeting climate change goals  alongside this our plans to repower the last of our coalfired units to highlyefficient combined cycle gas turbines ccgt and build four rapidresponse open cycle gas turbines ocgt will give the electricity system the flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources  the abilities of gas plant in balancing and system services can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025 in subsequent decades gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zerocarbon power system our retail businesses haven power and opus energy  also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint beyond just supplying renewable electricity were also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs reaching a zerocarbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers that depends on innovative thinking and new technologies we have the experience in developing transformative ideas and making them a reality  all of which will be essential in guiding us into a brighter more stable decarbonised future tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  negative emissions  will gardiner balancing for the renewable future 6 july 2018 power generation its not news to say great britains electricity system is changing low carbon electricity sources are on course to go from 22 of national generation in 2010 to 58 by 2020 as installation of wind and solar systems continue to grow but while there has been much change in the sources fuelling electricity generation the system itself is still adapting to this transformation when the national grid was first established in the 1920s it was designed with coal and big spinning turbines in mind it meant that just about every megawatt coming onto the system was generated by thermal power plants as a result the mechanisms keeping the entire system stable  from the way frequency and voltage is managed to how to start up the country after a mass black out  relied on the same technology these ancillary services  those that stabilise the system  are crucial to maintaining a balanced electricity system ancillary services are needed to make sure demand is met by generation and that generation gets from one place to the next with no interruptions explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax because whats important is that all demand must be met instantaneously in todays power system however weather dependent technology like offshore wind and home solar panels are increasingly making up the countrys electricity generation their intermittency or variability is in turn impacting both the stability of the grid and how ancillary services are provided running a large power system with as much as 85 intermittent generation  for example on a very windy clear sunny day  is thought to be achievable it isnt a scenario anticipated for the large island of great britain but to deal with the fastpace of change on its power system which recently managed to briefly achieve 47 wind in its fuel mix  there is a need to develop new techniques technologies and ways of working to change how the countrys grid is balanced new storage tech takes on balancing services one of the technologies thats expected to provide an increasing amount of balancing services is gridscale batteries  one stabilisation function offered by batteries and other electricity storage options is to provide reserve at times when demand peaks or troughs this matches electricity demand and generation combined with their ability to respond quickly to changes in frequency batteries can be a significant source of frequency response batteries can also absorb and generate reactive power  which can then be deployed to push voltage up or down when it starts to creep too far from the 400kv or 275kv target depending on the powerlines the electricity is travelling along needed to safely move electricity around the grid the challenge with batteries is that the quantity of megawatt hours mwh required to compensate for intermittency is very large the difference between the peak and trough on any day may be more than 20 gw for several hours see for yourself at electric insights  the significant price reductions in battery storage apply to technologies with short duration or low volume mwhs these are the technologies which have been developed at scale recently but will probably struggle to make up in any large quantity any shortfalls in generation resulting from prolonged periods of low intermittent generation a challenge currently being addressed relates to maintenance of battery state of charge this is a consequence of battery storage having a cycle efficiency of less than 100 this means that losses from continuous charging and recharging will have to be replenished from the available generation to avoid batteries going empty and being unavailable for grid services ultralow carbon advances rather than relying on batteries to provide ancillary services to support intermittent generation technical advancements are allowing the wind and solar facilities  which are generating more and more of the countrys electricity  to do so themselves the traditional photovoltaic pv inverters found on solar arrays were initially designed to push out as much active or real power as possible however new smart pv inverters are capable of providing or absorbing reactive power when it is needed to help control voltage as well as continuing to provide active power the major advantage of smart inverters is the limited equipment update required to existing solar farms to allow them to offer reactive power control the challenge here is that pv is embedded in distribution systems and therefore reactive services they provide may not cure all the problems on the transmission system similarly existing wind installations have traditionally focused on getting the greatest amount of megawatts from the available resources but with fewer thermal power stations on the grid ways of balancing the system with wind turbines are also being developed inertia is the force that comes from heavy spinning generators and acts as a damper on the system to limit the rate of change of frequency fluctuations while wind turbines have massive rotating equipment they are not connected to the grid in a way that they automatically provide inertia however research is exploring whats known as inertial response emulation that may allow wind turbines to offer faster frequency response this works through an algorithm that measures grid frequency and controls the power output of a wind turbine or whole farm to compensate for frequency deviations or quickly provide increases or decreases in power on the system inertial response emulation cannot be a complete substitute for inertia but can reduce the minimum required inertia on the system even in a future where the majority of the countrys electricity comes from renewable sources thermal generators may still be able to provide benefits to the system by running in synchronous compensation mode ie producing or consuming reactive power without real power however what is vitally important for the future of balancing services in great britain is a healthy transparent and investable market for generators demand side response and storage whether connected on the transmission or distribution networks a market for the future grid one of the primary needs of balancing service providers is greater transparency into how national grid procures and pays for services currently national grid does not pay for inertia with it becoming more important to grid stability incentive is needed to encourage generators with the capability to provide it those technologies that cant provide inertia could be encouraged to research and develop ways they could do so in the future standardising the services needed will help ensure providers deliver balancing products to the same level needed to support the grid it would also benefit from fixed requirements and timings for such services bundling related products such as reserve and frequency control and active power and voltage management will also offer operational and cost efficiencies to the providers driving investment in balancing services for the future ultimately requires the availability of longerterm contracts to offer financial certainty for the providers and their investors bridge to the future click to view larger graphic for the challenges of decarbonisation to be met in a socially responsible way great britains power system must be operated at as low a cost as possible to consumers with new technologies almost anything could be possible but operating them has to be affordable in many cases it may take time for costs of long duration batteries to come down  as it has with the most recent offshore wind projects to take contracts for difference cfds and draxs unit 4 coaltobiomass conversion under the renewables obligation  ro scheme  thermal power technologies such as gas that has proven capabilities in ancillary services markets can at least be used in a transitional period over the coming decades until a low carbon solution is developed biomass will continue to be an

electricity future 14 june 2018 power generation for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve a flexible stable and cleaner power system for everyone tags decarbonisation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy policy  energy prices  investors  national grid  1 2 3  name
