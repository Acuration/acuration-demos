technology carbon markets will be essential in reaching net zero  we must ensure they support high standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principals if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permanence of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principals proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principals include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permanence that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology carbon removals is a global need the us is making it possible 20 october 2022 carbon capture key takeaways removing carbon from the atmosphere is urgent if we are to meet global climate targets the uss commitment to supporting carbon removal technologies creates an opportunity for new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power stations the market for carbon credits is gaining increasing credibility and verification making it a source of financing for ambitious decarbonization projects carbon markets are needed now to make investment into vital removals projects possible in the us and globally after a summer of soaring temperatures across the northern hemisphere the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in double the loss of tree cover than in 2001 while today more than 23 billion people face water stress from drought its clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too we believe that carbon dioxide co 2  removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge experts and governments agree that in addition to economywide decarbonization removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero co 2 emissions by midcentury the ipcc says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero thats a huge step up from the 40 million tons captured globally in 2021 but also a significant investment opportunity our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of co 2 through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs outside the uk per year while generating renewable baseload electricity and supporting healthy sustainable forests the likely contender for our first location the united states we already operate in communities across the us south employing more than 1200 people in our sustainable biomass pellet production  now we are preparing to build a new beccs power station in the region its clear to us that the us is an ideal market for beccs with its longrunning sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent co 2 storage we see the countrys efforts to retire coal by 2030 and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the us our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year while also generating 2terawatt hours of 247 renewable power the uss newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the inflation reduction act as well as the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent scenario planning for 100 clean electricity system are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies and a new frontier for permanent highquality emissions removals the need for high quality permanent emissions removals a net zero future is only possible through the widespread implementation of highintegrity carbon removals beccs offers this by combining low carbon renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure permanent carbon sequestration beccs works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 as they grow co 2 released in the generation process is captured and stored permanently and safely in geological rock formations the overall process removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it emits resulting in negative emissions this allows us to offer decarbonizing industries highquality carbon removals credits given the scale of co 2 that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero i believe this market for verified co 2 removal credits is a trilliondollar opportunity voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain however increased oversight from investors ngos and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity prompting sustained adoption by businesses drax group ceo will gardiner click to viewdownload weve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at new york climate week the agreement with respira an impactdriven carbon finance business  will allow it to purchase 400000 metric tons of co 2 removals cdrs a year from our north american operations this would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own co 2 emissions reduction targets by purchasing cdrs from respira deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net co 2 emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified highquality emissions reductions as the global economy works towards its net zero targets co 2 removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today beccs stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality permanent carbon removals while also delivering baseload renewable power the ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies as they move away from fossil fuels the potential for the us driven by a dynamic mix of markets investors and engaged consumers some of the most prominent us companies are pledging to reach net zero investing in 247 renewable power and other means to do so technology companies like alphabet apple and microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations supply chains and even remove historic emissions other organizations like the first movers coalition include us companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving difficult decarbonization challenges  this industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action the recent inflation reduction act substantially increases the availability of the 45q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects increasing their value from 50 a ton of carbon removals to 85 per ton helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like beccs we believe the us is on the right track to create a market in which beccs can thrive the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent 100 clean electricity system report includes beccs in three of the four possible scenarios explored it forecasts the us will need between 714gw of installed beccs capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero co 2 emissions that equates to removals of approximately 55120 mt co 2 per year by 2035 the uss established forestry commercial industry with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample lowgrade wood and wood industry residues to power beccs the countrys longrunning exploration of co 2 capture and transport and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills supply chains and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects beccs is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology but action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality action is needed now for responsible businesses with the desire to go further faster or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes carbon removals from beccs deliver real verifiable and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond to net negative its encouraging to see the us pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market however carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community and in the environmental and civil society collaboration between governments corporations and ngos will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency we cant afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures buying and selling highquality permanent removals is the action we need today now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology  united states forests net zero and the science behind biomass 22 december 2021 sustainable bioenergy tackling climate change and spurring a global transition to net zero emissions will require collaboration between science and industry new technologies and decarbonisation methods must be rooted in scientific research and testing drax has almost a decade of experience in using biomass as a renewable source of power  over that time our understanding around the effectiveness of bioenergy its role in improving forest health and ability to deliver negative emissions has accelerated research from governments and global organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergys role in achieving net zero on a wide scale the european commission has also highlighted biomass potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy sustainably managed forests frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission in charge of the european green deal has emphasised its importance in bringing economies to net zero saying without biomass were not going to make it we need biomass in the mix but the right biomass in the mix the role of biomass in a sustainable future moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables supporting wind and solar by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels will require flexible sources of generation such as biomass as well as other technologies like increased energy storage  in the uk the climate change committees ccc sixth carbon budget report lays out its balanced net zero pathway in this lead scenario the ccc says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of co 2 or equivalent emissions mtco 2 e per year by 2035 increasing to 25 mtco2e in 2045 foresters in working forest mississippi biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity such as aviation shipping and industrial processes the cccs balanced net zero pathway suggest that enough lowcarbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 twh of nonelectric power in 2050  compared to the 1000 twh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today however bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks a report coauthored by ipcc experts examines the scientific literature around the climate effects principally co 2 abatement of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices the report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products including biomass that replace greenhouse gas ghgintensive fossil fuels and by storing carbon in forests and in longlived forest products the role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels the addition of carbon capture and storage ccs to bioenergy to create bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently the negative emissions made possible by beccs are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels beccs and the path to net zero the ipccs special report on limiting global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy  coupled with effective landuse that prevents it contributing to deforestation the second chapter of the report deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the midcentury bioenergy use is substantial in 15c pathways with or without ccs due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels however its the negative emissions made possible by beccs that make biomass instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios the ipcc report highlights beccs alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation ar that comes with sustainable forest management are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 15 o c graphic showing how beccs removes carbon from the atmosphere click to viewdownload there are two key factors that make beccs and other forms of emissions removals so essential the first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hardtoabate emissions negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of co 2 that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero the second reason beccs and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic co 2 emissions what makes co 2 such an important ghg to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other to help reach the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to below 15 o c removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential in the uk the cccs 2018 report  biomass in a lowcarbon economy  also points to beccs as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement it suggests that power generation from beccs will increase from 3 twh per year in 2035 to 45 twh per year in 2050 it marks a sharp increase from the 195 twh that biomass without ccs accounted for across 2020 according to electric insights data it also suggests that beccs could sequester 11 tonnes of co 2 for every tonne of biomass used providing clear negative emissions however the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and beccs is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that as a minimum requirement maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time with increased attention paid to forest management and land use there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a winwin solution that can decarbonise power and economies while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester co 2  how bioenergy ensures sustainable forests biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable climate beneficial or low carbon source of power uk legislation on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its longterm capacity to produce wood this is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from landuse changes such as urban creep where vegetated land is converted into urban concreted spaces depends on a healthy market for wood products industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higherquality wood while lowquality waste wood as well as residues from forests and woodindustry byproducts can be bought and used to produce biomass pellets  a report by forest 2 market examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the us south where drax sources about twothirds of its biomass the report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the us south instead it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the regions forests a synthesis report  which examines a broad range of research papers published in forest ecology and management in march of 2021 concluded from existing studies that claims of largescale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the south east us are not supported the use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net ghg greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels according to forest research  importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing in fact the opposite is true with annual wood growth in the us south increasing by 112 between 1953 and 2015  delivering a winwin solution the european commissions jrc science for policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report  the use of woody biomass for energy production in the eu suggests a winwin forest bioenergy pathway is possible that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term while at the same time not damaging or even improving the condition of forest ecosystems however it also makes clear loselose situations is also a possible in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policyrelevant timeframes winwin management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity a winwin future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse and naturally regenerated forests the report also warns of tradeoffs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions or vice versa these must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a loselose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations while beccs fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions in a future that will depend on science working in collaboration with industries to build a net zero future continued research is key to ensuring biomass can deliver the winwin solution of renewable electricity with negative emissions while

technology transporting carbon  how to safely move co2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach

carbon capture and storage dacs direct air carbon capture and storage dacs sometimes referred to as dac or daccs is one of the few technologies that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere unlike other carbon removal technologies that capture co 2 emissions during the process of generating electricity or heat dacs can be deployed anywhere in the world it can tap into a supply of electricity co 2 removal is crucial to meeting the international climate goals set by the 2015 paris agreement but its not enough just to cut co 2 emissions to achieve net zero  it will also be necessary to remove the co 2 that two centuries of industrialisation have released into the environment as a technology that removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  assuming it is powered by green electricity  dacs has the potential to play a key role in this process how does dacs work dacs could be described as a form of industrial photosynthesis just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and co 2 into sugar dacs systems use electricity to remove co 2 from the atmosphere using fans and filters air is drawn into the dacs system using an industrial scale fan liquid dacs systems pass the air through a chemical solution which removes the co 2 and returns the rest of the air back into the atmosphere solid dacs systems captures co 2 on the surface of a filter covered in a chemical agent where it then forms a compound the new compound is heated releasing the co 2 to be captured and separating it from the chemical agent which can then be recycled the captured co 2 can then be compressed under very high pressure and pumped via pipelines into deep geological formations  this permanent storage process is known as sequestration alternatively the co 2 can be pumped under low pressure for immediate use in commercial processes such as carbonating drinks or cement manufacturing a 2021 study by the coalition for negative emissions shows that dacs could provide at least 1gt of sustainable negative emissions by 2025 dacs fast facts human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of co 2 by 48 above preindustrial levels found in 1850 during prehistoric ice ages co 2 levels were around 200 parts per million ppm the average level in 2020 was more than 417ppm 101 out of 116 of the ipcc scenarios mitigating greenhouse gas emissions depend on using negative emissions technology  including dacs what role can dacs play in decarbonisation co 2 is in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world this means that dacs plants can be located anywhere unlike carbon capture systems that remove co 2 from industrial processes at source there are 15 dacs plants currently in operation worldwide  climeworks operates three in switzerland iceland and italy together these smallscale plants capture approximately 9000 tonnes of co 2 per annum the first largescale plant  currently being developed in the permian basin texas is expected to capture 1000000 tonnes one megatonne per annum when it becomes operational in 2025 at just 004 the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere is very dilute which makes removing and storing it a challenge this means that dacs costs significantly more than some other co 2 capture technologies  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne the process also requires large amounts of energy which adds to the demand for electricity however dacs has the potential to become an important piece in the jigsaw of co 2 removal technologies and techniques that includes naturebased

gases into the air but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide co 2  currently in the atmosphere and the co 2 that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise the process of greenhouse gas removal ggr or co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere is possible through negative emissions  where more co 2 is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere negative emissions can be achieved through a range of naturebased solutions or through manmade technologies designed to remove co 2 at scale what naturebased solutions exist to remove co 2 from the atmosphere one millenniaold way of achieving negative emissions is forests  trees absorb carbon when they grow either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen or storing it over their lifetime this makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere planting new forests and regenerating forests has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result however this can also go beyond forests on land vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store co 2  and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much carbon as forests on land  an approach to negative emissions called blue carbon did you know bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world  its thick forests absorb three times the amount of co 2 the small country emits what manmade technologies can deliver negative emissions many scientists and experts agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this approach uses biomass  sourced from sustainably managed forests  to generate electricity as the forests used to create biomass absorb co 2 while growing the co 2 released when it is used as fuel is already accounted for  making the whole process low carbon by then capturing and storing any co 2 emitted often in safe underground deposits the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative  as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added direct air carbon capture and storage daccs is an alternative technological solution in which co 2 is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used while this could hold huge potential the technology is currently in its infancy and requires substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice the process of removing co 2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions because more co 2 is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it how much negative emissions are needed according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  negative emissions technologies could be required to capture 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050 negative emissions fast facts humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere the crust of the earth to the biosphere where we live at 100 times the rate of the natural carbon cycle there is enough sustainable biomass available to the uk to support beccs to remove 51 megatonnes of co 2 every year by 2050 according to the committee on climate change more companies are beginning to invest in negative emissions technologies with apple conserving mangroves  stripe allocating 1 million annually to purchasing sequestered carbon and

technology what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a largescale source  for example a power station or factory  and then permanently storing them carbon capture usage and storage ccus is where captured carbon dioxide co 2  may be used rather than stored in other industrial processes or even in the manufacture of consumer products  how is carbon captured carbon can be captured either precombustion  where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used or postcombustion  where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned precombustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide under heat pressure the separated co 2 is captured and transported to be stored or used postcombustion carbon capture uses the addition of other materials such as solvents to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned the isolated carbon is then transported normally via pipeline to be stored permanently  usually deep underground  or used for other purposes carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that co 2 is not released into the atmosphere what can the carbon be used for once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways for example material including carbon nanofibres and bioplastics can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles while several startups are developing methods of turning captured co 2 into animal feed captured carbon can even assist in the largescale production of hydrogen  which could be used as a carbonneutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation where can carbon be stored carbon can be stored in geological reserves  commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs saline aquifers or unmineable coal beds the process of storage is referred to as sequestration the underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through mineral storage  where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage according to the global ccs institute  over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the usa norway and brazil what are the benefits of carbon storage co 2 is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in our atmosphere and therefore contributes to global warming by capturing and storing carbon it is being taken out of the atmosphere which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change carbon capture fast facts ccus is an affordable way to lower co 2 emissions  fighting climate change would cost 70 more without carbon capture technologies the largest carbon capture facility in the world is the petra nova plant in texas which has captured a total of 5 million tonnes of co 2  since opening in 2016 drax power station is trialling europes biggest bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage project beccs which could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year by the mid 2030s delivering a huge amount of the negative emissions the uk needs to meet net zero go deeper laying down the pathway to carbon capture in a net

capturing carbon tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  faqs frequently asked questions  negative emissions  sustainability  technology what is decarbonisation carbon capture what is decarbonisation decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide co 2  output of a countrys economy this is usually done by decreasing the amount of co 2 emitted across the active industries within that economy why is decarbonisation important currently a wide range of sectors  industrial residential and transport  run largely on fossil fuels  which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal oil or gas the co 2 emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas trapping in heat and contributing to global warming by using alternative sources of energy industries can reduce the amount of co 2 emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change why target carbon dioxide there are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming however co 2 is the most prevalent as of 2018 carbon levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  the paris agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures dont rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial level with 195 current signatories  economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon with the uk leading the g20 nations in decarbonising its economy in the 21 st century how is decarbonisation carried out there are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power such as wind turbines solar panels and coalto biomass upgrades  meaning that homes and businesses dont have to rely on fossil fuels other innovations such as using batteries and allowing homes to generate and share their own power can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation as the electricity itself is made cleaner it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process other approaches such as reforestation or carbon capture and storage  help to pull existing carbon from the air to neutralise carbon output  or in some cases help to make electricity generation  and even entire nations  carbon negative alternative power options means that homes and businesses dont have to rely on traditional carbon fuels what is the future of decarbonisation for decarbonisation to be more widely adopted as a method for combating climate change there needs to be structural economical change  according to deloitte access economics creating more room for decarbonisation through investing in alternative energies means that there are a multitude of jobrich shovelready stimulus opportunities that also unlock longterm value decarbonisation fast facts a study by carbon brief in 2019 found that the uks carbon emissions have decreased by 38 since 1990 which is faster than any other major developed nation the uk has committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by enshrining this goal as law  and announcing a 3 billion investment in low carbon technologies in 2019 currently heavy industry cement steel and chemicals and heavyduty transport mainly shipping and aviation account for 30 of co 2 emissions  worldwide energy consumption over a large range of sectors  including transport heating construction and production  is the biggest source of humancaused greenhouse gas emissions providing 73 of global carbon output iceland is the only nation to currently have 100 of its energy derived from natural sources  with 73 sourced from hydropower and 27 coming from geothermal power go deeper 4 charts

beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  faqs frequently asked questions  negative emissions  sustainability  technology from steel to soil  how industries are capturing carbon 11 march 2020 carbon capture carbon capture use and storage ccus is a vital technology in the energy industry with facilities already in place all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide co 2  emissions however for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2 o c  as per the paris climate agreement  emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy from cement factories to farmland ccus technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world construction the global population is increasingly urban and by 2050 its estimated 68 of all people will live in cities  for cities to grow sustainably its crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced construction currently accounts for 11 of all global carbon emissions  this includes emissions from the actual construction work such as from vehicle exhaust pipes but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials steel and concrete are emissionsheavy to make they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions deploying widespread ccus in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment steel manufacturing alone regardless of the electricity used to power production is responsible for about 7 of global emissions  projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in europe and are already in motion in the united arab emirates abu dhabi national oil company and masdar a renewable energy and sustainability company formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercialscale ccus projects in its project with emirates steel which began in 2016 about 800000 tonnes of co 2 is captured a year from the steel manufacturing plant this is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery eor the commercially selfsustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrialscale projects in the region cement manufacturing a process that produces as much as 8 of global greenhouse gases  is also experiencing the growth of innovative ccus projects norcem cement plant in brevik norway has already begun experimenting with ccus calculating that it could capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year and store it under the north sea if the project wins government approval norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023 however as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it a team at massachusetts institute of technology is exploring a new method of cement production that is more ccus friendly  by pretreating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process the co 2 produced is released in a pure concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products such as fizzy drinks agriculture its hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry as well as feeding the world it employs a third of it  within this sector fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply however the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2 of global co 2 emissions ccus technology can reduce the co 2 contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser while maintaining crop reliability in 2019 oil and gas climate initiatives ogci climate investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest ccus project in the us based at the wabash valley resources fertiliser plant in indiana  the project will capture between 13 and 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the ammonia producer per year the captured carbon will then be stored 2000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer similarly since the turn of the millennium mitsubishi heavy industries engineering has deployed ccus technology at fertiliser plants around asia  co 2 is captured from natural gas precombustion and used to create the urea fertiliser however the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more naturebased and cheaper ways soil acts as a carbon sink capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it however intensive ploughing can damage the soils ability to retain co 2  it only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques like minimising soil disturbance or crop and grazing rotations to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of co 2 and even make farms carbon negative  transport the transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions according to the world health organisation electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sectors decarbonisation however at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads there are other essential modes of transport where ccus has a role to play climeworks a swiss company developing units that capture co 2 directly from the air has begun working with rotterdam the hague airport to develop a direct air capture dac unit on the airports grounds climeworks plant technology source climeworks photo by julia dunlop hydrogen filling station in hamburg germany however beyond just capturing co 2 from planes taking off climeworks aims to use the co 2 to produce a synthetic jet fuel  creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere a pilot project aims to create 1000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021 another approach to zerocarbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen which is already powering cars trains buses and even spacecraft  hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways but its predominantly created from natural gas through a process in which co 2 is a byproduct ccus can play an important role here in capturing the co 2 and storing it  preventing it entering the atmosphere the hydrogenpowered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat from every industry to every business to everyone as ccus technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites to entire economic regions global thermostat is developing dac technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes the system uses the waste heat to power a dac unit either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere such technologies along with those already in action like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  can quickly make negative emissions a reality at scale  however to capture transport and permanently store co 2 at the scale needed to reach net zero collaboration partnerships and shared infrastructure between businesses in industrial regions is essential the uks humber region is an example of an industrial cluster where a large number of highcarbon industrial sites sit in close proximity to one another by installing beccs and ccus infrastructure that can be utilised by multiple industries the uk can have a far greater impact on emissions levels than through individual smallscale ccus projects decarbonising the uk and the world will not be achieved by individual sites and industries but by collective action that transcends sectors regions and supply chains implementing ccus at as large a scale as possible takes a greater stride towards bringing the wider economy and society to net zero learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus why experts think bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will be an essential part of the energy system the science of safely and
