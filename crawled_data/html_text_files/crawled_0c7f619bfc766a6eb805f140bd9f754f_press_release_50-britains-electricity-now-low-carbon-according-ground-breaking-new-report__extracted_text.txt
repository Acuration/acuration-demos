according to groundbreaking new report 14 november 2016 lowcarbon sources of energy  such as nuclear hydro biomass wind and solar  now contribute twice as much electricity than they did in 2010 20 carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at a record low  down a third over a 12month period and 56 over four years britain now has 26gw of wind and solar installed  a sixfold increase over the last six years while biomass has increased from nothing to 2gw of generating capacity carbon price floor plays a big role in reducing coals contribution which was just 3 of the uks electricity last quarter  down from 38 during the same period in 2012 last quarter for the first time ever more than half 502 of britains electricity was produced from lowcarbon energy sources according to a new quarterly research report released today authored by researchers from imperial college london in collaboration with drax between july and september 2016 the contribution of nuclear biomass hydro wind solar and lowcarbon electricity imports from france peaked at 502 up from just 20 in 2010  demonstrating the scale and impact of britains renewable energy revolution over the last six years and the unprecedented changes taking place in the uk energy sector launched today the drax electric insights report is designed to shed light on the dramatic impact of these changes which include the governments commitment to shift away from coal by 2025 obligations to decarbonise policy levers including the carbon price floor commitments to new nuclear and prices reaching new highs and new lows using consolidated data produced by national grid and elexon who run the electricity network and balancing market respectively it will focus quarter by quarter on data charting supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the networks that connect them  providing new empirical evidence to contribute to the uk energy debate according to this quarters report nuclear energy provided the largest share of lowcarbon energy over the last three months generating over a quarter of the uks electricity 26 followed by onshore and offshore wind 10 solar 5 biomass 4 lowcarbon energy imports from france 4 and hydro 1the data also revealed that britain now has 26gw of solar and wind installed a sixfold increase since 2010 while biomass has increased from nothing to 2gw of power generation over the same period crucially the findings also reveal the sharp decline in coal which has been largely due to the increases to the carbon price floor which took effect last year just 3 of britains electricity last quarter was generated from this fossil fuel  down from over a third 38 during the same period in 2012  placing it below wind solar and biomass in the uk energy generation league tables for the very first time in fact for almost six full days last quarter the uk was completely coal free  the first instance britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity since 1881 as the report points out a quarter of britains coal stations have shut down over the last 12months in the last quarter alone coal utilisation fell to its lowest ever levels  with plants producing just 7 of their maximum capacity  less than half the productivity of britains solar panels over the quarter according to the research this move away from dispatchable fossil fuels like coal towards weather dependent renewable while slashing emissions is also forcing the uk power system into new challenging territories last quarter at its minimum only 47 gw of electricity was generated from flexible dispatchable power plants meaning they had less breathing space for times of low demand and high renewables output in contrast prior to 2013 this minimum level had never previously fallen beneath 10gw the report also found that volatile power prices are likely to be the new normal in the uk with last quarter witnessing the highest energy prices for several years and an alltime low zero or negative power prices  when high inflexible power generation meets low demand  occurred 45 times over the last quarter twice as many as during the whole of 2015 combined at the same time this quarter also saw the highest peak energy price for three years on thursday 15th september when prices reached 802mwh drax power ceo andy koss said this report shows britains energy system is changing dramatically and we are seeing real benefits cleaner energy has reached a record high and carbon emissions from electricity hit a record low we can also see the crucial role that policy levers like the carbon price floor play but there is more to do to make britain truly low carbon additional reliable affordable clean energy is needed on the system along with a focus of getting the balance right more intermittent renewables like wind and solar are crucial but they will require more flexible back up like biomass to provide homes and business with electricity on demand dr iain staffell of imperials centre for environmental policy said you cannot manage what you cannot measure although there is a huge amount of data available on our electricity system before now there was no way to put it all together to see the big picture of what is happening and more importantly why my work with drax provided an opportunity to apply my research to cut through the noise and understand britains electricity is changing for the better we are so used to badnews stories about the environment so it is good to see that for once concrete progress is being made the first edition of the report also found that carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at a record low  down a third over a 12month period and 56 over four years  thanks to the rise of clean energy and the switch from coal to gas three quarters 76 of the uks electricity consumption emissions are now produced from burning gas  with 14 from produced burning coal  a role reversal from 2012 when coal accounted for 76 and gas 22 of these emissions respectively the last 12 months saw 32 gw of new wind and solar farms come online  while a quarter of the countrys coal capacity came off grid electric insights will be published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  wwwelectricinsightscouk  which provides live data from 2009 until the present the data sources and methodology used in electric insights are listed in full on the website commissioned by drax group owner and operator of one of the uks largest power stations and europes biggest biomassfuelled power

electric insights quarterly was commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by national grid and elexon who run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year it will focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009
