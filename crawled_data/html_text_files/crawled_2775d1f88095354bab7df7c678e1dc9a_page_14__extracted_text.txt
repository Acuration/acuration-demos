archives press release drax group ceo responds to the nics report on engineered greenhouse gas removals 29 july 2021 press releases the publication of the nics report further demonstrates the significant role engineered greenhouse gas removal technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage will play in enabling the uk reach its net zero target however urgent action is required within the next decade to support their roll out if the government is to meet its climate obligations deploying beccs at drax will not only save the uk billions of pounds over the next decade as the governments own analysis shows it will be vital if the uk is to meet the targets set out in the fifth and sixth carbon budgets it will also see the creation of a major new infrastructure sector in the uk which could rival the size of the uks water sector creating and protecting tens of thousands of jobs across the north levelling up the uk and positioning us as a global leader in negative emissions technologies editors notes the nic report is recommending that the government commits to deploying engineered removals at scale by 2030 and publish a plan to do so by no later than the end of 2022 by 2030 engineered removals should be delivering between 5mtco 2 and 10mtco 2 of negative emissions per year by 2030 the engineered removals sector could be receiving revenues of approx 2bn per year rising to 10s of bn by 2050 the first beccs unit at drax could be operational by 2027 with the second by 2030 the two units could capture up to 8mt of co 2 per year 80 of the amount the nic states will be needed by 2030 beccs is the lowest cost engineered method to permanently capture and store carbon for hundreds of years beccs at drax will save the uk more than 13bn to meet the 5 th carbon budget according to research from leading energy consultancy baringa tags energy policy  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture

drax has now slashed its co 2 emissions from power generation by over 90 percent since 2012 radically transforming the company and securing its place as one of europes lowest carbon utilities using sustainable biomass and hydro in the first half of 2021 drax became a purely renewable power generator producing 12 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power over 5 million homes and support the deployment of intermittent renewables such as wind and solar and by deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at the power station drax is set to go even further  generating the negative emissions needed to meet the uks net zero climate target while delivering jobs and clean growth in the north british renewable energy company drax group has cut the carbon emissions from its power generation by over 90 per cent in under a decade becoming one of europes lowest carbon intensity power generators and moving it closer to achieving its worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 formerly the largest coal power station in western europe drax has this year ended commercial coal generation sold its existing gas assets and transformed itself into one of the regions primary decarbonisers  it is now a purely renewable power generator drax has also made significant progress in the first half of 2021 with plans to deploy the worlds largest carbon capture project by fitting critical negative emissions technology beccs at the power plant in north yorkshire deploying beccs at drax could enable the renewable energy company to make an even greater

initiative developed by drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to boost stem education and skills the visitor centre team at drax power station has worked with colleagues at doncaster college and university centre to develop the stem box project an engaging activity for students to take part in relating to the subject areas of science technology engineering and maths a group of students aged between seven and ten at sunnyfields primary school in scawthorpe have been provided with individual activity boxes containing a range of learning materials games and resources they will need to build their robots the focus of which is on recycling and forms part of their school curriculum during the covid19 lockdown many pupils have struggled to engage with homeschooling and projects like the stem box provide a valuable opportunity to transition back into the school routine and get students enthusiastic about learning again the robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal or builtin compartments to store paper students also received a video recorded by the visitor centre guides to provide them with instructions once covid restrictions are relaxed they intend to deliver this introduction in person in schools as well as providing a visit to the power station as part of the project to help students understand the important role that recycling plays there drax groups head of sustainable business alan knight said by providing schools with these resources we hope to further students understanding of the importance of recycling and hopefully fire up their imaginations and inspire them to study stem subjects by showing them the wide range of career options that are available liane clark from childrens university at doncaster college said childrens university cu are excited to share this fantastic project with our cu schools to create an enriching learning experience that will inspire our future working generation our partnership with drax has enabled a unique learning opportunity which we hope will encourage children to deepen their knowledge and have a positive impact on their future children at sunnyfields primary school are the first to take part in the project which the drax power station visitor centre team plan to roll out to other schools across the region after the summer holidays teacher chloe hoogwerf said the students had a great time taking part in the stem box programme learning about drax and building the recycling robots activities like these are so important as it really brings the subject to life and gets students enthusiastic about stem as well as encouraging them to start thinking about careers they might enjoy in the future drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the next generation of engineers by encouraging interest in
