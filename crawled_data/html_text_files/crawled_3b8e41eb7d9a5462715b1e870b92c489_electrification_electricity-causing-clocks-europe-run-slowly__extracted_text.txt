electricity supply and demand is causing electric clocks to lose their ability to keep time 16 march 2018 electrification on the continent  in the cultured sunblushed terraces of the mediterranean time moves slowly or at least thats the view from the grey british isles it turns out however its true or at least for the first weeks of 2018 it was true  at first it was small  perhaps too small to notice but by early march electrical clocks in europe were running nearly six minutes slow what caused this mass scale time loss electricity but to understand how electricity was causing clocks to lose time you first need to understand how it helps them keep time how does electricity keep time almost all clocks save for the earliest sundials and hourglasses measure time using a simple dynamic oscillation  the repetitive and rhythmic movement of something between two points for example in a pendulum clock each swing or oscillation of a suspended weight between two points shifts a single tooth of a gear which in turn shifts other gears and eventually the hands of a clock face because that movement is consistent and regular it can be used as a measurement of time clock technology has advanced beyond the abilities of a pendulum but it remains driven by this principle of measuring oscillation a quartz clock measures the vibration or oscillation of a piece of quartz an atomic clock measures the vibration of atoms and electrons and an electrical clock measures the oscillation of electricity  otherwise known as its frequency the fundamentals of electrical frequency in the uk and across europe all electricity operates at a frequency of 50 hertz hz which is determined by the number of directional changes alternating current ac electricity makes every second a synchronous electrical clock  the kind found in ovens microwaves and digital alarm clocks  uses this consistent oscillation to measure seconds and tell time electrical clocks have been designed this way because electricitys frequency is consistent  it needs to be any slight deviations above or below 50 hz can damage electrical devices and equipment in great britain national grid and service operators around the country  including drax power station  work to maintain this consistent frequency through a service called frequency response  which instructs generators to either increase or decrease generation depending on overall network demand which in turn controls frequency this is because frequency is regulated by keeping generation and demand across a network perfectly balanced too much generation drives frequency higher not enough causes it to fall its this that caused europes electrical clocks to run slowly but to understand the source of the frequency imbalance you first need to understand how europes grid works how six minutes dropped off the map the continental europe power system connects 25 countries from spain to turkey in one synchronous electrical network which runs on the same frequency and can all share power within this there are smaller transmission system operators tsos that balance the power supply of smaller groups of countries like national grid does for gbs network one of these zones includes serbia macedonia and montenegro a region with wellknown longstanding political tensions kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 however serbia refuses to recognise its sovereignty  a feeling which extends to some parts of kosovos population night view of pristina capital city of kosovo in the northern parts of kosovo along the serbian border the population is largely of serbian origin and side with serbia on the question of kosovos independence they also refuse to pay for its power this leaves the rest of the country  who are largely of albanian descent  to pay the cost of the countrys overall electricity which they do via subsidies added to their bills but when kosovos energy regulator removed the subsidy earlier this year it led to a sudden hole in the money paying generators which in turn led to a fall in how much electricity was being generated crucially however demand didnt fall with it instead kosovo was using more power than it was generating causing electrical frequency on the network to drop and because kosovo is part of a shared and synchronous network that stretches across the continent that frequency imbalance although incredibly small spread across the network overall frequency dropped 001 drop over the continental european grid  too small to trigger a full system shut down but big enough to mean that every second electrical clocks were counting was slightly slower than it should be big enough to mean that over time europe lost six minutes as of 8 march an agreement has been met between the countries to meet demand and so although the power that wasnt being generated hasnt been replaced there is no longer an ongoing imbalance frequency has normalised and clocks  now reset  are running on time share name
