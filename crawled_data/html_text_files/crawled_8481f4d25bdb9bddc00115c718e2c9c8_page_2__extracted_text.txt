decarbonisation  investors  sustainability drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags decarbonisation  investors  supply chain  sustainability  united states  wood pellets active management of forests increases growth and carbon storage 28 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy a study on the historical trends in the forest industry of the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the forest2market report found that increased demand for wood is statistically correlated with more annual tree growth more wood volume available in the forest and more timberland for example between 1953 and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical perspective on the relationship between demand and forest

next for bioenergy 11 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power today when we talk about electricity we talk about climate change about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies theyre all inexplicably linked and all hold uncertainties for the future but in preparing for whats to come it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us researchers at universities across the uk including the university of manchester and imperial college london have put their heads together to think about this question and together with the supergen bioenergy programme theyve created a unique graphic novel on bioenergy that outlines three potential future scenarios based on their imagined views of the future theres plenty to be optimistic about but it could just as easily go south future one failure to act on climate change in the first scenario our energy use and reliance on nonrenewable fuels like oil coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while its affordable neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends  energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption in response electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up which leads to several problems attempts to secure a dwindling stock of nonrenewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security as resources run out attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years the damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive future two growing a stable centralised bioenergy a future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isnt the only way forward bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future in fact nearly all scenarios where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees celsius margin recommended by the paris agreement rely on widespread bioenergy use with carbon capture and storage beccs but how far could the implementation of bioenergy go a second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major centralised features in global energy networks this limits the effects of a warming climate particularly as ccs technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground this has knockon effects for the rest of the world large tracts of land are turned over to forestry to support the need for biomass creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests in industry largescale ccs systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further future 3 the right mix bioenergy a third scenario takes a combined approach  one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of beccs energy renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives this relies on the advance of a few key technologies widespread adoption of advanced battery technology sees wind and solar implemented at scale  providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities these communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common whether future three  or any of the above scenarios  will unfold like this is uncertain these are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is its up to us all  not just governments but businesses individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too  to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want tags climate change  energy policy  investors  technology this is how you unload a wood chip truck 30 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy a truck arrives at an industrial facility deep in the expanding forestland of the southeastern usa it passes through a set of gates over a massive scale then onto a metal platform the driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console slowly the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises as it does the trucks cargo empties into a large container behind it two minutes later its empty this is how you unload a wood fuel truck at drax biomass compressed wood pellet plants in louisiana and mississippi  what is a tipper some people call them truck dumpers but it depends on who you talk to says jim stemple senior director of procurement at drax biomass we just call it the tipper regardless of what its called what the tipper does is easy to explain it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently the sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the atlantic however at industrial facilities in the united states its more common tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn grain and gravel stemple explains basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping both of drax biomass two operational pellet facilities a third is currently idle while being upgraded use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark  known in the forestry industry as hog fuel which is used to heat the plants wood chip dryers  sawdust and raw wood chips which are used to make the compressed wood pellets  how does it work the tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other to ensure safety each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end where the load is emptying from so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long once tipped far enough each platform tips to a roughly 60degree angle the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for one way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles  which then goes through the pelleting process of the hammer mills the dryer and the pellet mill says stemple the other way takes it to the fuel pile which goes to the furnace the furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 115 and 12 before they go through the pelleting process if everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour says stemple from full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load efficiency benefits using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach but its also an efficient one firstly theres the speed it allows multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour and because cargo is delivered straight into the system theres no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system secondly for the truck owners the benefits are they dont need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks instead its just the tipper  one piece of equipment  which is maintained to keep operations on track however there is one thing drivers need to be wary of what they leave in their driver cabins open coffee cups food containers  anything not firmly secured  all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play i guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once stemple says the first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time tags biomass energy  investors  technology  transport  wood pellets 3 ways decarbonisation could change the world 27 june 2017 sustainable business mitigating climate change is a difficult challenge but its one well within the grasp of governments companies and individuals around the world if we can start thinking strategically on the behalf of the german government the internal energy agency iea and the international renewable energy agency irena have jointly published a report outlining the longterm targets of a worldwide decarbonisation process and how those targets can be achieved through longterm investment and policy strategies at the heart of the report is a commitment to the 66 two degrees celsius scenario which the report defines as limiting the rise in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius by 2100 with a probability of 66 this is in line with the paris agreement which agreed on limiting global average temperature increase to below two degrees celsius here are three of the findings from the report that highlight how decarbonisation could change the world the energy landscape will change  and thats a good thing decarbonisation will by definition mean reducing the use of carbonintensive fossil fuels today 81 of the worlds power is generated by fossil fuels but by 2050 that will need to come down to 39 to meet the 66 two degrees celsius scenario according to the report but this doesnt mean all fossil fuels will be treated equally coal will be the most extensively reduced while other fossil fuels will be less affected oil use in 2050 is expected to stand at 45 of todays levels but will likely still feature in the energy landscape due its use in industries like petrochemicals gas will likely also remain a key part of the energy makeup thanks to its ability to provide auxiliary grid functions like frequency response and blackstarting in the event of grid failure renewables like biomass will likely play an increasing role here as well particularly when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs technology overall renewable energy sources will need to increase substantially in the reports global roadmap for the future renewables make up two thirds of the primary energy supply reaching this figure will be no mean feat  it will mean renewable growth rates doubling compared with today everyday electricity use will become more efficient the report highlights the need for enduse behaviour to change this can mean everyday energy users choosing to use a bit less heat power and fuel for transport in our daytoday activities but a bigger driver of change will be by investment in better more efficient enduse technology  the technology devices and household appliances we use every day  in fact the study argues that net investment in energy supply doesnt need to increase beyond todays level  what needs to increase is investment in these technologies for instance by 2050 70 of new cars must be electric cars to meet decarbonisation targets infrastructure design could also be improved for energy efficiency  smart grids battery storage and buildings retrofitted with energy efficient features such as led lighting will be essential theres also the possibility of increased use of cleaner building materials and processes  for example constructing large scale buildings out of wood rather than carbonintensive materials such as concrete and steel decarbonisation will cost but not decarbonising will cost more the upfront costs of meeting temperature targets will be substantial a case study used in the report estimates that 119 trillion would need to be spent on lowcarbon technologies between 2015 and 2050 but it also suggests another 29 trillion may be needed to meet targets however failure to act could mean the world will pay out an even higher figure in healthcare costs or in other economic costs associated with climate change such as flood damage or drought therefore the sum for decarbonisation could end up costing between two and six times less than what failing to decarbonise could cost on top of this the new jobs including those in renewable fuel industries that will replace those lost in fossil fuels and opportunities that will be created between 2015 and 2050 could add 19 trillion to the global economy more than that global gdp could be increased by 08 in 2050 thanks to added stimulus from the low carbon economy achieving a cleaner future wont be easy  it requires planning effort and the will to see beyond shortterm goals and think about the longterm benefits but as the report demonstrates get it right and the results could be considerable tags decarbonisation  fossil fuels  investors how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power on our shores tags investors  railways and trains  supply chain  sustainability what is a working forest 1 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy for centuries civilizations have relied on forests and forest products forests provided fuel food and construction materials and there were plenty of them but when in 18 th century europe the needs of growing industrialisation sent development into overdrive a problem arose forests were struggling to meet demand in germany the problem was acute the growing steel industry had increased demand for wood to power its smelters and for wood used in mining operations large areas of forestland were stripped to meet industrys needs and overall supply was quickly decreasing no one was more acutely aware of the challenge than hans carl von carlowitz who at the time was the head of the saxon mining administration so in 1713 he published silvicultura oeconomica a book which advocated the conservation and management of german forests so they could provide for industries in the long term although he drew on existing knowledge from around europe it was the first time an important term was used nachhaltigkeit the german word for sustainability  carlowitz explained this new term conservation and growing of wood is to be undertaken in order to have a continuing stable and sustained use as this is an indispensable cause without which the country in its essence cannot remain it was arguably the start of the scientific approach to forestry and although our needs of forests have changed as have the words we use to describe them  working forest plantation forest and managed forest all refer to largely the same thing that same principle is at the heart of how a modern working forest functions to ensure what exists and is useful today will still be there tomorrow this approach relies on responsible forest management which sets out a few key principles on how a forest should be managed to sustain its life providing room to breathe working forests are commonly managed to produced sawlogs  high value wood that can be sawn to make timber for construction or furniture for a forester to optimise the quality and quantity of sawlogs regular thinning is required thinning is the process of periodically felling a proportion of the forest to aid its overall health and vigour this means there are fewer trees fighting for the same resources water sunshine soil more than that thinning can promote diversity by providing more light and space for other flora thinning can occur several times in a forests cycle it can be used to increase the size and quality of the remaining trees and also to encourage new seedlings to establish in place of the harvested trees when managing for continuous forest cover httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201705whatisaworkingforestfinalmp4 nothing should be wasted the roundwood produced by thinning is often too small to be sold as sawlogs but that doesnt mean its worthless it can be sold to the pulp industry to make paper or for particleboard or to the biomass industry to make compressed wood pellets  which can be used to fuel power generation  as is done at drax power station  these industries also provide a market for the lower grade roundwood removed when the more mature trees are finally harvested in areas where there was no robust market for this low grade wood it would often be left on site and become a fire risk or a haven for pest and disease attack too much low grade material left on site can also inhibit the regrowth of the next tree crop so markets for this material are important for the health of the forest and the value of the land to the forest owner also in the baltic countries markets for pulpwood are limited and the energy sector provides a valuable opportunity to clear the site for replanting and provide additional revenue to the forest owner this process of utilising all parts of the forest is essential for a healthy working forest on the one hand the revenue can cover the cost of thinning this husbandry enhances the quality of the final tree crop and ensures that money is available to invest in future planting and regeneration ensuring the forest area is consistently maintained and improved young regeneration in a shelterwood system demonstrating the continuous forest lifecycle the carbon benefits of a working forest rather than diminishing it actively managing a forest helps its ability to sequester  or absorb and store  more carbon  carbon sequestration is directly related to the growth rate of a tree  a young growing tree absorbs more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than an older one  older trees will have more carbon stored after a childhood spent absorbing it but if these are not harvested they are more susceptible to fire damage pests and diseases and their carbon absorption plateaus in an actively managed forest older trees ready for sawlog production can be harvested and replaced with vigorously growing young trees and in the process maximise the co 2 absorption potential of the forest the byproducts of this process  the low grade wood and thinnings  can be used for the pulp and biomass industry which both aids the health of the remaining forest and provides revenue for the forester to invest in the long term life of his or her forest  three centuries of sustainability in the 300 years since carlowitz published his book on sustainability a lot has changed and while its unlikely he foresaw forests providing fuel for renewable electricity and renewable heat  the approach remains as relevant what is a working forest it is one that is as productive and healthy tomorrow as it is today that were using the same resource today as we were 300 years ago is evidence to suggest its a practice that works tags forests  investors  sustainability
