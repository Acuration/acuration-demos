Korean electricity producers learn about powering past coal
6 July 2018
Press releases

A group from a Korean power station has visited Drax to understand how it transformed itself from being the UK’s biggest coal-fired power station to become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
The delegation from
Korean South-East Power Co.
visited Drax Power Station near Selby in North Yorkshire, where enough renewable electricity is now produced from sustainable biomass to power more than four million homes.
The group had a tour of the power station and heard about how Drax upgraded half of its generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the UK’s biggest single site renewable power generator.
Drax signed up to the government’s
Powering Past Coal Alliance
earlier this year. The UK-Canadian initiative seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries as part of efforts to tackle climate change.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“Unabated coal does not have a role in our low carbon future. In the UK there has already been a dramatic fall in power generation from coal – an 84% reduction in the last five years, and a major shift towards lower carbon technologies.
“We want to share some of the engineering knowledge and expertise gained from successfully upgrading half of the power station to use biomass, with other power producers in the hope we can help to remove more coal from the system and develop a low carbon future globally.”
Drax is currently
converting a fourth coal generating unit to use biomass,
and is also progressing plans for
repowering its two remaining coal units with gas power generation and batteries
.
It welcomes over 13,000
visitors to the power station
each year. As a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, Drax is committed to the development of a low carbon future globally.



New Drax Trains: Powering the Northern Powerhouse
5 July 2018
Press releases

Since it upgraded half of the power station near Selby in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, Drax has transformed its business to become Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project and the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator.
Key to its success is its supply chain – including the development of bespoke train wagons able to transport compressed wood pellets in the quantities needed to the power station.
Drax’s rail wagons, the first of their kind in the world, were designed and developed by Lloyd’s Register Rail (Ricardo) and
WH Davis
– the UK’s last independent freight wagon manufacturer.
Work is now being carried out at Davis Wagon Services’ facilities (a subsidiary of WH Davis) to re-brand all 225 of Drax’s rail wagons, complete with new Northern Powerhouse branding.
Drax is a member of the government’s
Northern Powerhouse
initiative, which is aimed at boosting the region’s economy by investing in skills, innovation, transport and culture.
Jake Berry, Northern Powerhouse Minister said:
“The development of Drax’s train wagons is a Northern Powerhouse success story – I’m delighted to unveil the first of the newly branded wagons.
“The energy sector has been and will continue to be a major source of jobs and economic opportunity in the North of England. It is worth over £5bn to the North and the region has more low carbon jobs per 1,000 employees than anywhere else in England.”
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“With these trains delivering up to 20,000 tonnes of biomass each day, we are now powering millions of homes and businesses across the UK with reliable, renewable electricity, whilst generating over £500m for the northern economy and supporting more than 6,000 jobs in the region – including some here at Davis Wagon Services’ facilities.
“We have invested £700m transforming the business from coal to biomass, including the development of an entirely new supply chain, and these rail wagons are a vital part of that investment.
“Our biomass comes into the ports on the east and west coasts from North America and Europe, and is brought to the power station by rail, because it is more efficient than road transportation – helping us to make carbon savings of more than 80 per cent compared to when we used coal to generate electricity.”
John Hall, Managing Director of Davis Wagon Services Ltd, said:
“Our parent company is the last UK rail freight manufacturer, and winning the contract with Drax firstly to develop and build these unique biomass wagons and now in maintaining them, has enabled us to retain a number of staff in skilled jobs and invest £850,000 in our facilities here in the North.
“We will be working with Drax as it rebrands all of its wagons over the coming two years, re-wrapping them with the new branding as part of a rolling maintenance programme.”

Editor’s Notes
65% of the electricity Drax produced in 2017 was renewable – enough to power four million households.
Having upgraded three generating units to use biomass instead of coal, Drax is in the process of converting a fourth generating unit to use biomass which should be completed this summer. It has also submitted plans to repower its remaining two coal units with gas power and battery storage which are being considered by the Planning Inspectorate.
The majority of the biomass Drax uses comes from North America and Europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the UK (Immingham, Hull, Port of Tyne and Liverpool). It is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail.
Drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day (over a six-day working week) in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the UK’s renewable electricity.
Each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the UK with enough electricity for a year.
The fuel is transported to Drax via rail rather than road, to further reduce carbon emissions, as it is more efficient than road transportation. Using rail saves approximately 270,000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 32,622.50 tonnes of C02 per year
Independent research by Oxford Economics using 2016 data showed that Drax supported over 18,500 jobs across the country – more than 6,000 of which were across the North of England (Yorkshire and Humber, North West and North East). In addition Drax generated £577m for the Northern Powerhouse regional economy and £1.7 billion for the whole of the UK.

World Cup cuppas see Great Britain’s electricity demand surge
4 July 2018
Press releases

The nation breathed a collective sigh of relief after England’s victory in the tense penalty shootout against Colombia last night, and what better way to celebrate than with a cup of tea?
At half time, an additional 1,200MW of electricity was required from National Grid to cope with the number of kettles boiling, lights being switched on, toilets being flushed and pints being pulled.
The surge in demand was even greater than National Grid expected and equated to almost half a million kettles being boiled.
Demand surged to over 34,400MW during the game last night – 150MW more than National Grid had anticipated. However, the spike in demand was successfully plugged – largely by gas generation.
One of the biggest surges in sporting history still goes to the World Cup Semi Final in 1990 –  England v West Germany. The electricity demand was 2,800MW – equivalent to 1,120,000 kettles being boiled.
After that fateful penalty miss the population made for the kitchen. The match was watched by an estimated 26 million people in the UK. When full time was called they caused a 2,800MW surge in electricity demand.
The World Cup Quarter Final of 2002 – England v Brazil – also saw an enormous spike. Broadcast early on a Wednesday morning in the UK due to time differences with South Korea, where the game was played, the match saw England put up a solid fight against overall tournament winners Brazil.
A goal from Michael Owen provided early hope and at half time TV viewers left their screens to cause a huge 2,570MW spike in demand. By the time the game had reached its conclusion, Brazil had won thanks to a chipped Ronaldinho free kick that fooled England keeper David Seaman and those viewers who had lasted the duration caused a slightly smaller 2,300MW surge.

electricinsightsco.uk
which provides live data from 2009 until the present.



Most accurate Electric Insights now available
29 June 2018
Press releases

Drax
Electric Insights,
an interactive website which provides live data and analysis on the supply, demand, price and environmental impact of Britain’s electricity, has been upgraded to deliver the most accurate, up to date information yet.
The information used by the website now includes data from
Sheffield Solar
, the UK photovoltaic industry’s leading scientific data resource.
Their data complements the information supplied by National Grid and Elexon, who run the electricity and balancing markets respectively, which means Electric Insights can provide more accurate real time and historic information about solar power on the system.
Drax Electric Insights quarterly was launched in 2016, with reports delivered independently by a team of academics at Imperial College London – facilitated by the College’s consultancy company – Imperial Consultants.
Dr Iain Staffell, from Imperial College London said:
“The UK has around a million solar PV installations, but virtually none of them are metered on an hour-by-hour basis.  Information on distributed renewable generation has been very difficult to access – until now.
“This new data feed from Sheffield Solar means the Electric Insights platform can deliver the most accurate near real-time information about what’s happening right across the power sector.”
Dr Alastair Buckley, who heads up the Sheffield Solar Group, at the University of Sheffield said:
“We’re delighted that Drax Electric Insights have chosen to source their solar PV data directly from us.  We strive to make our solar PV data as accurate as possible to help National Grid operate as efficiently and as low carbon as possible and it’s great to see the data coming directly into Electric Insights – making visible the changes and challenges of the GB electricity sector”.
Ian Foy, Head of Ancillary Services at Drax, said:
“The energy sector is often criticised for being overly complex. Drax Electric Insights was born out of our desire to improve things by making the power sector more accessible to everyone.
“Since then it has become an important tool in helping organisations, as well as individuals, to better understand how the system works. These latest improvements will make it an even more relevant resource, delivering greater transparency.”

Drax Repower project application accepted by Planning Inspectorate for examination
26 June 2018
Press releases

Drax Power Station’s application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for its Repower gas generation and battery storage project has been accepted for examination by the Planning Inspectorate.
Plans to replace Drax’s remaining coal generating units with up to 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of high efficiency gas-fired power generation and up to 200 megawatts (MW) of battery storage were first set out in September 2017.
Since then the company has been developing engineering and environmental reports for the application, as well as carrying out an extensive consultation programme with local people, landowners, councils and authorities.
The proposals will now be examined by an independent planning inspector before being considered by the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) with a decision expected in 2019.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“I am delighted that the Planning Inspectorate has accepted our application for examination. This is an important milestone for the Repower project and takes us a step closer towards securing the future of the power station.
“With our gas Repower plans and the conversion of a fourth generating unit this summer to use biomass instead of coal, we intend to extend the life of the plant, protect jobs and deliver the flexible and reliable power millions of households and businesses need.
“By upgrading and reusing some of our existing infrastructure to use gas, we will be able to provide more capacity, stability and essential grid services cost effectively, and deliver the government’s commitment to end power generation with unabated coal by 2025.”
“We are committed to involving our local communities in our Repower plans and look forward to engaging with all interested parties over the coming months as the planning process progresses.”
Drax is already the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator having converted three coal generating units to use sustainable wood pellets, with the fourth set for this summer. More than two thirds of the power produced is now renewable, providing 15% of the UK’s renewable electricity – enough for four million homes.

Editor’s Notes
The planning process for the DCO is as follows:
Now the Repower application has been accepted for examination, Drax will notify local authorities, landowners and other statutory consultees and they will receive a copy of the accepted application documents.
In addition, a notice will be published at or near the Repower site and in relevant newspapers to publicise the accepted application. This notice will provide information to local people on where they can review the application and how and when they can make representations to the Planning Inspectorate.
Anyone who makes a representation can register to become an ‘Interested Party’ once the examination process starts.
If the application is accepted, the Planning Inspectorate will appoint an independent inspector known as an ‘Examining Authority’ to oversee the examination of the application, a process that is likely to start in the autumn.
A preliminary meeting with Interested Parties, Drax and the Examining Authority will be held to coincide with the start of the examination process. Interested parties will be given at least 21 days’ notice of the meeting. At this meeting, the Examining Authority will inform Drax and Interested Parties of the examination procedure and schedule going forward.
The post-application and examination processes, including the formal notification of the accepted application and the consultation on the Application documents (undertaken in accordance with Section 56 of the Planning Act 2008), are defined by relevant regulations and the Planning Inspectorate.

22 June 2018
Press releases

As part of its bicentenary celebrations, the ICE is recognising 10 significant engineering infrastructure assets and ten engineers across each UK region. Drax Power Station has been selected as one of the 10 major infrastructure assets for Yorkshire and Humberside.
It received a special commemorative plaque, which recognises Drax’s continued contribution to engineering.
Drax Power CEO, Andy Koss, accepted the plaque on behalf of the power station, surrounded by its engineers, employees and apprentices, as well as some potential future engineers from Camblesforth Primary school.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“Drax Power Station is not just an iconic feature of the Yorkshire landscape, it is also home to some of the very best engineers in the world. We are honoured to be recognised for the contribution our Drax engineers have made to the UK and to celebrate our heritage.
“We welcome around 13,000 visitors to the power station each year – many of whom are students, ranging from primary school-age to post-graduates. By bringing energy and engineering to life, we can inspire the next generation.
“Drax is a critical part of the nation’s infrastructure and last year we produced 15% of the UK’s renewable power. Our team of talented engineers converted three of our six generating units to run on sustainable biomass and our fourth is being converted this summer.”
Mark Calvert, Chairman of the Yorkshire and Humber committee at the ICE said:
“ICE 200 is a fantastic celebration of great works of engineering and achievements across the country and it’s wonderful to see so many engineers who have contributed so much to Drax power Station over the years.
“We are not only looking to the past though; we are creating the next generation of engineers. They will be the invisible superheroes who might not be seen but are all around us. People get up in the morning and turn the lights on without thinking about it, but behind that simple task is a feat of engineering that ensures the lights stay on for us all, and that’s what we want to celebrate, these engineers who are transforming lives and transforming society.”

About ICE 200
The Institution of Civil Engineers is reaching a rare milestone in 2018 – a bicentenary.
ICE 200 is a perfect chance to celebrate the institution’s longevity, recognise the profession of civil engineering and most importantly the thousands of members who make the institution what it is. ICE will use the bicentenary as opportunity to remind the general public that civil engineers transform their lives for the better and safeguard the future for their families. In doing so, the institution also hopes to encourage young people to see civil engineering as a creative, rewarding and highly enjoyable career.
Events are planned for throughout 2018 and information will be made available on the ICE website:
