do by 2025  consistent with the uk governments objectives having at least two biomass generating units operating with beccs technology running at 90 availability capturing and storing eight million tonnes of co 2 a year this would more than compensate for draxs projected co 2 emissions from its other operations in 2030 drax has included all harmful greenhouse gases as defined by the kyoto protocol in its calculations the greenhouse gas protocol corporate standard classifies a companys greenhouse gas emissions into three scopes scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or

of the reporting company including both upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions are not included in draxs calculations for achieving its carbon negative status in 2030 this is in line with accepted practice globally based on the greenhouse gas protocol however had its sustainable biomass supply chain emissions been included drax would still be a carbon negative company in 2030 drax has signed up to the un global compact science based targets which provides companies with a clearly defined pathway to futureproof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse

needed for britain to reach net zero climate target 4 december 2019 press releases energy storage will play a major role in the energy transition supporting renewables like wind and solar power great britain could need at least 30gw of energy storage to meet climate goals  ten times the available storage today energy storage such as pumped storage hydro and batteries enables further decarbonisation by providing system services to support more renewables across great britain europe and the us the need for energy storage is set to soar as more renewables such as wind and solar power connect to the grid in efforts to meet the net zero carbon targets required to address the climate emergency according to analysis by imperial college for drax electric insights britains energy storage capacity alone will need to grow to around 30gw or more over the next 20 to 30 years from 3gw today dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights reports said energy storage is one of the most important issues in the energy industry  it has the potential to dictate the pace scale and cost of the energy transition along with other technologies such as interconnection and flexible generation energy storage helps integrate more renewables onto the system which makes it easier to manage the grid and enables greater decarbonisation at lowest cost imperials analysis shows that for the current gb electricity mix with a quarter of power coming from variable renewables every unit of intermittent renewables added to the system requires an additional 02 units of energy storage capacity to smooth out intermittency and keep the grid stable as the share of wind and solar power rises towards 80 of electricity supplied every extra unit of intermittent renewables will require 1 unit of energy storage dr oliver schmidt coauthor of the report and senior consultant at cleantech advisory apricum said this summers blackout in britain highlights the value of having a range of fastacting technologies and that demand will only grow as older thermal power plants retire and are replaced by intermittent renewables well also need a rapid expansion of other forms of flexibility such as demandside response interconnectors and fastacting flexible power stations as well as from pumped storage hydro which is currently the biggest storage technology and batteries where costs are falling andy koss ceo generation drax said pumped storage hydro plays a vital role in the uks energy system today  able to reach full load in as little as 30 seconds it is proven to be able to react quickly to resolve intermittency issues associated with some renewable technologies its clear from this electric insights report that more energy storage systems are vital to ensure the country has the power it needs in the decades ahead as wind and solar become the biggest sources of electricity as the leading flexible power generator on great britains national grid drax has opportunities in storage and other technologies to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future the imperial college study found that variable renewables are providing an increasing share of energy supply with wind farms alone providing more than half of britains electricity for the first time ever in q3 2019 this is creating unprecedented challenges in balancing the power system keeping the uks power system stable made up a tenth of the total cost of generating electricity and the cost of balancing the power system hit a record high of 380mwh in q3 read the

email protected t 07712670888 notes to editors imperial colleges analysis looked at 28 scenarios from 24 studies evaluating potential energy storage requirements in europe and the us the 24 independent studies forecast how much energy storage would be required depending on the share of demand met by variable renewables such as wind and solar figure 1 the studies looked at europe germany gb and the us installed storage capacities are divided by the peak demand for electricity in each region to account for the relative size of countries 1 70 to 80 per cent of electricity production from variable renewables would require storage capacity of around a third of peak electricity demand in the current gb system 60gw peak this would mean around 20gw of storage the uk committee on climate change expects that electricity demand will double by 2050 with peak demand rising to 150gw  implying there will be an even greater need for storage demandside response interconnection or flexible power stations could be deployed to a similar extent which would reduce the need for additional storage although current academic and industrial studies suggest that storage will become the main flexibility technology cruachan power station draxs pumped storage plant in scotland acts responsively by generating electricity to meet peaktime demand it can achieve full load in 30 seconds and

technology if beccs can be used across all four of its biomass generating units drax could become the worlds first negative emissions power station helping it to make an even greater contribution towards tackling the climate emergency pupils were taken on a full tour of the site including the innovative beccs pilot plant which is capturing a tonne of co2 each day the 427metre turbine hall that houses the six huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity they also enjoyed a closeup view of the uks first wood pellet storage domes each large enough to fit the royal albert hall inside and the 12 cooling towers which at 115 metres high are taller than the statue of liberty drax groups head of business sustainability vicky bullivant said by providing tours at drax power station we want to further students understanding of how electricity is produced and hopefully fire their imaginations and inspire them to study stem subjects by showing them some of the pioneering technologies were trying like beccs which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis during the tour pupils learned how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable

at the power plant in yorkshire where female employees from drax ran group activities games and mini workshops at stands to illustrate the skills they use in their daily jobs at the event the girls crowded around stands that highlighted careers in 10 different areas at drax business ethics viable fuels  sustainability facilities procurement engineering and maintenance finance fuel  logistics research  innovation communications and it community engagement  outreach and human resources who organised the event were also on hand to answer career questions jess williams who is studying mechanical engineering at selby college said talking to the female engineers made me realise how much there is on offer at drax and its inspired me to apply for an apprenticeship here when i finish college and university it was great to see how involved the women are in keeping the power station running ella parsonag who is a student at selby high school said i think its important as a woman to pursue careers in engineering such career paths arent popular at the moment and i would like to inspire more young women to become part of the engineering industry  there are good opportunities and the world will always need engineers rosie and molly students at holy family catholic high school in carlton said it was important for women to get involved and push for the same opportunities as men just because were female doesnt mean were any less entitled to get the job we want in the future said rosie students from holy carlton school talking to natalie wright technical engineering trainee at the engineering and maintenance stand alongside the engineering departments stand which had a model of how the power station works the finance teams drax monopoly board illustrated the value of making the right decisions research  innovations top trumps game focused on evaluating new ideas and projects while fuel and logistics showed the steps needed to bring fuel for the power station from canada

system flexibility in review of nine leading european countries 13 november 2019 press releases britain ranks eighth out of nine northern european countries in attracting and facilitating investment in electricity system flexibility a new industry report finds delivering flexibility is crucial to power sector decarbonisation and achieving net zero targets regulatory uncertainty lack of visibility on returns and technical challenges connecting to the network are delaying investment in flexibility and could hamper renewables deployment in the 2020s regulatory uncertainty lack of visibility on returns and technical challenges are impeding investment in flexibility services to support britains electricity network as more renewables come online risking delays in the transition to a greener future an industry report said the energy transition readiness index  a report published by the association for renewable energy  clean technology rea and commissioned by eaton and drax reviewed regulation and market access social and political support for the energy transition and deployment of enabling technologies such as smart meters in nine northern european countries britain which ranked eighth out of the nine countries in the index scored poorly on market factors such as a clear and stable regulatory and market framework the report also highlighted potential difficulties accessing the distribution network and a lack of progress on delivering smart electric vehicle charging overall results of the energy transition readiness index illustrated by a country ranking flexibility is becoming increasingly important as more variable renewables such as wind and solar replace britains large fossilfuelled power stations to meet targets to cut carbon emissions large generators typically provided flexibility by supplying power during peak demand and ensuring that the systems voltage and frequency remained within operational limits the netherlands topped the league table of nine countries finland sweden denmark ireland and norway also scored high while germany britain and france lagged dr nina skorupska chief executive of the rea said decarbonising power means delivering flexibility in a world of very lowcost variable renewable electricity generation grids need to be organised differently and some services which were once taken for granted need to be actively procured crucially as renewable power prices fall around the world every country will be experiencing the same shift if britain becomes a flexibility pioneer then a whole world of markets for exporting our products and services opens up whilst this index shows were lagging behind theres still time to bounce back thats why the rea is calling for the next government to address the barriers to flexibility by delivering wholesale systems change and reform ofgem as a priority drax head of strategy robert riley said flexibility is essential to enable netzero carbon in britain for 2050 it reduces the risks of power cuts and builds resilience into the grid so that the system can handle the volume of intermittent renewables that well need without these flexibility services its going to be much harder and more costly to transition to a cleaner electricity system theres a huge potential for innovative flexible technologies to play a role more could be done to provide a level playing field and clarity on business models so that they can contribute to the zerocarbon ambition drax already provides a number of flexibility services in the uk including frequency management inertia and reserve power from its biomasspowered plant in yorkshire hydro in scotland and is looking to provide further flexibility services including from rapid response gas plants eaton head of energy storage business fabrice roudet said we welcome britains ambition and its strong policy commitment to decarbonisation encouraging new flexibility technologies and business models however we urgently need more clarity and an end to the flux to provide the certainty needed to spur private investment in the new technologies that will be required to ease the transition to a highrenewable energy future robert hull author of the report said in britain the strong ambition for the energy transition and growing flexibility markets hasnt yet translated into the market and regulatory framework which is complex

storage drax has partnered with eaton to supply and connect battery storage systems to small businesses that are already customers of drax such as farms and offices so they can store power generated from onsite micro renewables like wind turbines and solar this allows draxs customers to maximise the value of the renewable energy they generate either using it when it is required or selling it back
