renewable energy supporting a circular economy in the forests alan knight group director of sustainability 16 june 2022 opinion every year in british columbia millions of tonnes of waste wood  known in the industry as slash  is burned by the side of the road land managers are required by law to dispose of this waste wood  that includes leftover tree limbs and tops and wood that is rotten diseased and already fire damaged  to reduce the risks of wildfires and the spread of disease and pests the smoke from these fires is choking surrounding communities  sometimes smoking out entire valleys air quality meteorologist from bcs environment ministry trina orchard recently told infonewsca it also impacts the broader environment releasing some 3 million tonnes of co 2 a year into the atmosphere according to some early estimates slash pile in british columbia landfilling this waste material from logging operations isnt an option as it would emit methane  a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more potent than co 2  so you can see why it ends up being burned in its modernizing forest policy in bc the government has already identified its intention to phase out the burning of this waste wood left over after harvesting operations and is working with suppliers and other companies to encourage the use of this fibre this is a very positive move as this material must come out of the forests to reduce the fuel load that can help wildfires grow and spread to the point where they cant be controlled let alone be extinguished the wildfire risk is real and growing each year more forests and land are destroyed by wildfire impacting communities nature wildlife and the environment in the past two decades wildfires burned two and a half times more land in bc than in the previous 50year period according to very early estimates emissions from last years wildfires in the province released around 150 million tonnes of co 2  equivalent to around 30 million cars on the road for a year alan knight at the log yard for lavington pellet mill in british columbia during my recent trip to british columbia in canada first nations foresters academics scientists and government officials all talked about the burning piles of waste wood left over after logging operations rather than burning it it would be far better they say to use more of this potential resource as a feedstock for pellets that can be used to generate renewable energy while supporting local jobs across the forestry sector and helping bolster the resilience of canadas forests against wildfire i like this approach because it brings pragmatism and common sense to the debate over canadas forests from the very people who know the most about the landscape around them burning it at the roadside is a waste of a resource that could be put to much better use in generating renewable electricity displacing fossil fuels and it highlights the positive role the bioenergy industry can play in enhancing the forests and supporting communities drax is already using some of this waste wood  which i saw in the log yard for our lavington pellet mill in british columbia this waste wood comprises around 20 of our feedstock the remaining 80 comes from sawmill residues like sawdust chips and shavings waste wood for pellets at lavington pellet mill log yard its clear to me that using this waste material that has little other use or market value to make our pellets is an invaluable opportunity to deliver real benefits for communities jobs and the environment while supporting a sustainable circular economy in

2021 power generation what is pumped storage hydro pumped storage hydro psh is a largescale method of storing energy that can be converted into hydroelectric power the longduration storage technology has been used for more than half a century to balance demand on great britains electricity grid and accounts for more than 99 of bulk energy storage capacity worldwide how does it work the principle is simple pumped storage facilities have two water reservoirs at different elevations on a steep slope when there is excess power on the grid and demand for electricity is low the power is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir using reversible turbines when demand is high the water is released downhill into the lower reservoir driving the turbines the other direction to generate electricity pumped storage hydro plants can also provide ancillary services to help balance the power system such as inertia from spinning turbines  which ensures the system runs at the right frequency and reduces the risk of power cuts why is pumped storage hydro important for energy transition governments around the world are shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to meet their climate goals but critically important power technologies such as wind and solar pose challenges for power grid operators being weatherdependent the supply from these renewables is intermittent for example wind farms accounted for almost a quarter of the uks total electricity generation in 2020  but on some days less than 10 of the countrys electricity needs were met by wind changing weather patterns and extreme weather events with prolonged periods of little wind or reduced daylight are a further the threat to grid stability when output from renewables falls grid operators mostly turn to gasfired power stations to plug the gap but relying on fossil fuels such as natural gas in the long term to balance the grid will compromise efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050 pumped storage hydro facilities act as vast water batteries they are a flexible way of storing excess energy generated by renewables costeffectively and at scale how can pumped storage hydro capacity be increased as old thermal power plants are decommissioned and renewables provide an increasing share of the electricity supply storage capacity will need to grow if climate goals are to be met over the next two to three decades great britains energy storage capacity alone will need to increase tenfold from 3 gigawatts gw to around 30 gw pumped storage hydro power stations require very specific sites  with substantial bodies of water between different elevations there are hundreds if not thousands of potential sites around the uk including disused mines quarries and underground caverns but the cost of developing entirely new facilities is huge a more costeffective way to increase storage capacity is by expanding existing plants  such as the cruachan power station in scotland  pumped storage hydro fast facts pumped storage hydroelectric projects have been providing energy storage capacity in italy and switzerland since the 1890s  the uk has four pumped storage hydro power stations in scotland and wales with a total capacity of 28 gw the dinorwig hydro power station in wales can switch from being fully shut down to operating at full capacity in just 12 seconds when completed in 2023 fengning pumped storage power plant in hebei province china will become the worlds largest pumped hydro station with 6 gw capacity go deeper the story of the men who built a power station inside a

energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore wind 29 the worlds largest power station of any kind  the three gorges dam in china runs on a renewable energy source

really big scale  how different countries use their landscapes to generate energy  there are plenty of uses for fossil fuel power stations in an allrenewable future tags faqs frequently asked questions  biomass energy  sustainability  decarbonisation  renewable energy turning waste into watts 3 september 2020 sustainable bioenergy think of carbon emissions and the image that comes to mind is often of industrial sites or power generation  not of what we eat and what we throw away but food waste is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions globally food loss and waste from across the food chain generates the equivalent of 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  a year  or about 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions but what if there was a way to reduce those emissions and generate power by using discarded food and other organic waste like grass cuttings or nut shells a technology known as anaerobic digestion is increasingly making this idea a reality how anaerobic digestion works all organic waste products have energy in them but its tied up in the form of calories when food and vegetation rots microorganisms break down those calories into gases and other products methane or ammonium molecules exactly what these other products are depends on whether there is any oxygen present with oxygen the products are water co 2 and ammonia but remove oxygen from the equation and a very valuable gas is produced methane ch 4  the lack of oxygen is also what gives anaerobic digestion its name  when oxygen is present it becomes aerobic digestion during the anaerobic digestion process bacteria and other microorganisms break down organic matter gradually deteriorating complex polymers like glucose or starch into progressively simpler elements such as alcohol ammonia co 2 and ultimately ch 4  a biogas with huge potential as a fuel for other processes anaerobic power in practice the ch 4 produced in anaerobic digestion is incredibly useful as a fuel  turn on a gas hob or stovetop and its predominantly methane that provides the fuel for the flame the chemical compound is also the main component in the natural gas that makes up much of great britains electricity supply this means using anaerobic digestion to create ch 4 out of waste products turns that waste into a valuable power source but its not as simple as putting a bag over a rubbish tip and hoping for the best instead anaerobic digestion is carried out in large tanks called digesters these are filled with feedstocks from biological substances that can include anything from food scraps to alcohol and distillery waste to manure under the right conditions microorganisms and bacteria begin to digest and breakdown these substances into their basic elements the air quantity and temperature of the digesters is carefully regulated to ensure the microorganisms have the best possible environment to carry out the digestion of the feedstock with different types of feedstock and microorganisms operating best in different conditions the biogas created as a result of this digestion is then captured ready to be turned into something useful making use of biogas three different things can happen to the biogas produced during the course of the digestion locally it can be combusted onsite to provide further heat to regulate the temperature of the anaerobic digestion units or it can be combusted in a combined heat and power chp generator where it can generate electricity to be used on site  for example to power a farm  or sold through energy suppliers such as opus energy onto wider regional or national electricity networks this biogas electricity is an important element of great britains energy supply accounting for 6600 gwh or 73 of all power generated by solid and gaseous fuels in 2017 some of the biogas can even be cleaned to remove co 2  leaving behind pure methane that can be pumped onto natural gas grids and used to provide heat and power to households government research estimates a fully utilised biogas sector could provide up to 30 of the uks household gas demands  after the digestion process has been completed and the biogas has been removed what is left behind in the digester is a mass of solid matter called digestate this is extremely rich in nutrients and mineral such as potassium and nitrogen making it an excellent soil enhancer where anaerobic digestion is being used today today much of anaerobic digestion power is generated on farms  unsurprisingly given the ready access to biological waste material to use as feedstock as well as a potential source of electricity and heat it also gives farmers access to a new revenue stream by selling electricity or biogas as well as reducing utility and fertiliser costs while many of these installations are smaller scale some can get quite big linstock castle farm in north cumbria for example has a biogas facility with a 11 megawattmw operating capacity enough to power as many as 2000 homes at a time it was originally installed by the farmers as a more costeffective way of growing their business than buying more dairy cows there is however potential for anaerobic digestion to operate on an even larger scale in the us the city of philadelphia is developing a system that will link all newly built households together into a network where food waste is automatically collected and transported to a biogas generating facility closer to home northumbrian water uses 100 of its sludge the waste produced from purifying water to produce renewable power via anaerobic digestion  its estimated to have reduced the carbon footprint of the facilitys operations by around 20 and saved millions of pounds in savings on operating costs there have also been experiments with using biogas to power vehicles the biobus was the first bus in the uk to be powered by biomethane made from food sewage and commercial liquid waste and ran between bath and bristol airport but anaerobic digestion power is not a magic bullet it will be right in certain situations but not all if utilised effectively anaerobic digestion and biogas could fill a vital role in national electricity and gas networks while at the same time helping dispose of waste products in an environmentallyfriendly and costeffective way tags renewable energy  biomass energy  gas  customers  electricity generation  opus energy 5 exciting energy innovations that you should know about in 2020 5 june 2020 power generation as we head into the 2020s  its an exciting time for energy a deeper level of climate consciousness has led to crucial changes in populations attitudes and thinking around how we power our lives  adapting to a new set of energy standards has become essential its also driving innovation in energy technology leading to the rise of a number of emerging technologies designed to support the global energy transition in new ways from domestic solar and wind generation to leaps forward in recycling and aeroplane fuel here are five new energy ideas in the 2020s pipeline miniature turbines for your garden think of a wind farm and you might think of giant structures located in remote windswept areas but thats quickly changing icewind is developing residential wind turbines that use the same generatorprincipal as largescale wind farms just on a much smaller scale a set of three outer and three inner vertical blades rotate when the wind passes through them providing spinning mechanical energy that passes through the generator and is converted to electricity constructed from durable stainless steel carbon fibre and aluminium the cw1000 model can handle wind speeds of up to 134 miles per hour to ensure theyre fit for domestic use the units are adapted to have a maximum height of just over 3 metres and make less than 40 decibels of noise  roughly equivalent to quiet conversation the icelandic company says it aims to decentralise and democratise energy generation by making wind power accessible to people anywhere in the world expanding solar to cover more surfaces as solar technology becomes more widespread and easier to implement more communities are turning to a prosumer approach and generating their own power roof panels to date have been the most common way to domestically capture and convert rays but solecco is taking it a step further offering solar roof tiles these work in the same way as roof panels using photovoltaic cells made of silicon to convert sunlight into electricity but by covering more surface area entire roofs can be used to generate solar energy rather than single panels environmental street furniture takes it a step further by bringing small scale solar generation into many aspects of the urban environment such as smart benches rubbish bins and solar lighting in green spaces this opens up opportunities for powering cities including incorporating charging stations and network connectivity which in turn enables social power sharing repurposing plastic global recycling rates currently sit at approximately 18 indicating there are still further steps to take in ensuring singleuse products are eliminated plastic is a major target in the war on disposal and for good reason by 2015 the world had produced over seven billion tonnes of plastic  greenology is tackling this by harnessing a process called pyrolysis to turn plastic into power by heating waste at a very high temperature without oxygen the plastic is breaks down without combusting this process produces biooils which can be used to create biofuels the benefits of this innovative approach to waste are twofold not only can plastic be repurposed which minimises the lasting impact singleuse plastic has on the planet but the creation of biofuel offers a power source for everything from transport to generating electricity storing heat for the home decarbonising heating is one of the global challenges yet to have a clear answer pumped heat ltd phl is developing a potential solution with its heat battery technology the company has found a solution that enables its devices to charge up and store electricity during offpeak hours when electricity is at its cheapest and then use this energy to generate heating and hot water for homes as it is required as the grid continues to decarbonise and as renewable power becomes cheaper and more accessible the electricity used to charge these units will approach zero carbon content the heat battery technology utilises vacuum insulation losing 10 times less heat than a conventional night storage heater in contrast air sourced heat pumps a more commonly used type of heat pump operate in real time when a home needs heating they take water at its delivery temperature which can be very cold during the winter months and heat it using electricity available at that time pumped heats storage system instead ensures there is always heat available maintaining a consistent temperature for hot water or central heating rather than just when there is an excess of electricity the company claims the benefit of using a heat battery system is that it is cheaper than an oil or lpg boiler in a world where renewable electricity production both domestic and on a national level is only set to increase wastepowered planes as some of the most fossil fuelreliant industries in the world travel and transport are actively seeking alternative and more sustainable ways to keep them powered in long run velocys aims to do this using waste the company is developing sustainable fuels for aviation and heavy goods transport using the fischertropsch method of gasifying waste  this involves turning waste materials  such as domestic refuse and woody waste  into clean jet fuel using a catalytic chemical reaction where synthesis gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen are converted into liquid hydrocarbons that can then be used for fuel not only does this make use of waste products that could have ended up in landfill but it produces much cleaner fuels that emit less particle matter and harmful pollutants into the atmosphere as we enter a new decade of invention the world is focusing on more sustainable alternatives to power our lives and these innovative solutions to current environmental issues will continue to inspire creativity tags sustainability  technology  wind power  transport  decarbonisation  renewable energy why spin a turbine without generating power 12 february 2020 power generation massive spinning machinery is a big part of electricity generation whether its a wind turbine hydro plant or biomass generator but big spinning turbines dont just pump electricity out onto the grid they also play a crucial role in keeping the electricity system stable safe and efficient this is because big heavy spinning turbines add something else to the grid inertia  this is defined as an objects resistance to change but in the context of electricity it helps the grid remain at the right frequency and voltage level in short they help the grid remain stable however as electricity systems in great britain and other parts of the world move away from coal and gas to renewables such as wind turbines solar panels and interconnectors the level of inertia on the system is falling we need the inertia we dont need the megawatts explains julian leslie head of networks at the national grid electricity system operator eso but in todays market we have to supply the megawatts and receive the inertia as a consequence engineer inspecting turbine blades at drax power station the national grid eso is taking a new approach to this aspect of grid stability by using what are called synchronous condensers these complicatedsounding pieces of machinery are actually quite straightforward in their concept they provide inertia to the grid without generating unnecessary power these come in the form of existing generators that remain connected to the grid but refrain from producing electricity purpose built machines whose only function is to act as synchronous condensers never generating real power these may be fitted with flywheels to increase their mass and in consequence their inertia this means that spinning without generating is about to become a very important part of great britains electricity system around and around electricity generators that spin at 3000 rpm are described as synchronous generators because they are in sync with the grids frequency of 50hz these include coal gas hydro biomass turbines and nuclear units most spin at 3000 rpm some machines much less eg 750 rpm thanks to the way they are designed they are all synchronised together at the same higher speed then there are wind turbines where the generated power is not synchronised to the grid system termed asynchronous generators these machines do not have readily accessible stored energy inertia and do not contribute to the stability of the system interconnectors and solar panels are also asynchronous its important that great britains whole grid is kept within 1 of the 50hz frequency  otherwise the voltage of electricity starts to fluctuate damaging equipment becoming less efficient even dangerous or resulting in blackouts say a power station or a wind farm were to drop offline as occurred in august 2019  this would cause the amount of power on the grid to suddenly fall but it is not just the power that changes  the frequency and voltage also fluctuate dramatically which can cause equipment damage and ultimately towns cities or widespread areas to lose power running machines that have inertia act like the suspension on a car  they dampen those fluctuations so they are not as drastic the big spinning machines keep spinning buying valuable milliseconds for the grid to react often automatically before the damage becomes widespread however as a consequence of decarbonisation more solar panels and wind turbines are now on the system and there are fewer spinning turbines leading to lower levels of inertia on the grid there are periods when renewable generation and flow from interconnectors are so great that it displaces all conventional rotational power plants says leslie today bringing more inertia onto the grid may mean switching off renewables or interconnectors and then replacing them with rotating plants and the megawatts associated with that creating a market for inertia and synchronous condensers offers a new way forward  providing inertia without unneeded megawatts or emissions from fossil fuels a new spin on grid stability at the start of 2020 the national grid eso began contracting parties including draxs cruachan pumpedhydro power station  to operate synchronous condensers and provide inertia to the grid when needed the plans mark a departure from the previous system where inertia and voltage control from electricity generators was taken for granted cruachan power station is already capable of running its units in synchronous condenser mode one of its units opened up for maintenance is pictured at the top of this article this involves an alternator acting as a motor offering inertia to the grid without generating unneeded electricity other service providers will repurpose existing turbines construct new machines or develop new technologies that can electronically respond to the grids need for stability synchronous condensers or the idea of spinning a turbine freely without generating power are not new concepts power stations in the second half of the 20 th century could shut down certain generating units but keep them spinning online for voltage control in the 1960s and 70s some substations  where the voltage of electricity is stepped up and down from the transmission system  also deployed standalone synchronous condensers these were also used to provided inertia as well as voltage control but are long since decommissioned synchronous condenser installation at templestowe substation melbourne victoria australia by mriya via wikimedia  synchronous condensers are a proven technology that have been used in the past says leslie and there are many new technologies we are now exploring that can deliver a similar service cheaper cleaner more stable the national grid eso estimates the technology will save electricity consumers up to 128 million over the next six years savings which come from negating the need for the grid to call upon fossil fuels for inertia as coal oil and gas become increasingly uneconomical across the globe as carbon taxes grow the fact that synchronous condensers do not produce electricity also saves money the grid may have had to pay out to renewable generators to stop them producing electricity or to storage systems to absorb excess power it means the market can deliver the renewable flow without the grid having to pay to restrain it or to pay for gas to stabilise the system says leslie not only does this allow more renewable generation but it also reduces the cost to the consumer in a future energy system where there is an abundance of renewable electricity generations synchronous condensers will be crucial in keeping the grid stable the national grid esos investment in the technology further highlights the importance of new ideas and innovation to balance the grid through this energy transition  synchronous generation provides benefits to system stability beyond the provision of inertia in a subsequent article well also explore how synchronous condensers can assist with voltage stability and help regional electricity networks and customers to remain connected to

renewable energy  cruachan power station how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from 11 june 2019 power generation the makeup of great britains power system changes constantly demand is always changing in winter it may peak at 50 gigawatts gw but overnight in summer it will be less than 20 gw some days wind is the biggest source of the countrys electricity generation other days its gas then there are days when for a few hours solar takes the top spot in the middle of the day and nuclear during the night in the past great britains electricity came almost entirely from big coal and nuclear power stations but as the need for decarbonisation has grown so has the number of sources feeding electricity to the grid creating an ever more complex and varied system made up of technologies that behave in very different ways for example some sources are weather dependent and cant generate all day every day others stop and start flexibly to smooth out changes in demand or intermittent generation but in the event all sources are available what dictates which sources actually generate and when the overriding influence is economics  the costs of starting up and running a turbine the price of fuel or taxes on carbon emissions in great britain electricitys wholesale price is not set in stone by an entity such as a regulator instead its negotiated via trading over the course of a day between generators power stations storage and wind turbines and suppliers who transmit that electricity to consumers as a result the price of electricity fluctuates every half hour responding to factors such as demand cost of fuels availability of resources such as sun and wind and carbon taxes for an example of the scale at which it fluctuates we can look at the period 14 june this year when the index price of electricity ranged from over 55mwh down to around 5mwh see chart above but while these figures speak to the overall price of a megawatt on the system they dont reflect all the individual sources nor their individual costs each of the multiple sources on the grid have their own operating costs fluctuating on a similar basis these changing prices give rise to what is known as the merit order a fluid theoretical ranking of generation sources this is not set by any regulator economist or even by traders rather it is a naturally occurring financial occurrence that explains what sources of electricity generation are feeding power onto the grid daytoday what is the merit order the merit order dictates which sources of generation will deliver power to the grid by ranking them in ascending order of price together with the amount of electricity generated this then determines the order in which power sources are brought onto the system ultimately suppliers want the right amount of electricity for the best possible price so in a system made up of many sources it is the lowest cost highest yield option that is brought online first which in theory helps keep overall electricity prices down north sea wind farm redcar this means it is often sources such as wind and solar which have no fuel costs that sit at the top of the merit order nuclear may come next as it continually generates a large amount of power for a low cost while taking a long time to turn down or off at the opposite end of the merit order are sources like coal and oil which have high fuel and carbon dioxide co 2  emission costs such as carbon taxes and the european emission trading scheme however the merit order isnt a set of hard and fast rules its an assumption used by traders or market commentators to guide what is likely to run and thereby the likely market price says ian foy drax head of ancillary services there is no published merit order it is like santa claus  it doesnt exist but it makes explaining christmas easier the intricacies of being in and out of merit if a generating unit is required to meet demand then its described as in merit if it is not required at any particular point in time then its out of merit  theres no point in suppliers paying for another power station for example to start generating if demand is already being met if the market is efficient we generate from the lowest cost source at all times says foy costs are not simple for example you have to take into account the cost of starting or shutting down generating units however costs are not publicly shared so theres no single view of the merit order each party has its own perspective on it it means the merit order changes from seasontoseason daytoday and hourtohour as rates of supply and demand and the availability of resources change dungeness nuclear power station in kent an obvious example is gas tends to be cheaper in summer than winter when its not being used for heating coal and gas also switch as global prices change says foy availability also changes over the year theres more solar in summer but none in the morning and evening peaks of winter there are also practical issues such as repairs being made on wind and hydro turbines or planned maintenance outages on thermal and nuclear power stations putting those generators out of action and knocking them out of merit and because the merit order is not an implemented working scheme it can be deliberately manipulated by outside forces one of the ways this is most clearly seen is in carbon pricing merit in a changing system the carbon price support tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain alongside the european emissions trading system have increased the cost of fossil fuel generation gas oil and coal levied as tonne of co 2 emitted this has the effect of pushing fossil generation down the merit order with coal emitting double the co 2 per unit of electricity compared to gas we can see how the merit order can be influenced to achieve environmental outcomes this has helped steer great britain towards record breaking coalfree periods and stimulated the building of low carbon generation sources other sources such as interconnection with europe and power storage facilities also slot into the merit order their position often shifts due to highly variable prices dependent on power generation in neighbouring countries or the amount of electricity that can be stored at a low cost respectively the grid is everchanging over the last two decades weve seen huge shifts in how power is generated and delivered this is unlikely to slow down in the near future but the merit order will remain like the grid it is in a constant state of change adapting to the many moving parts of the electricity system as long as great britain maintains its open electricity trading market the merit order will continue to dictate where the countrys power comes from tags renewable energy  electricity generation  carbon pricing  decarbonisation how getting renewable energy from your supplier actually works 2 april 2019 sustainable bioenergy where does our electricity come from one answer might be the power stations wind turbines and solar panels that generate it you might even go as far as to say the wind sun water biomass and gas powering those stations or even the network companies transporting that power around the country but theres also a very important middleman in this process electricity suppliers most of great britain gets its power from one of the big six energy suppliers which buy electricity from the wholesale market and then sells it to consumers however with more businesses and consumers looking for less carbonintense electricity sources there are now a whole host of smaller companies taking on the incumbents and offering allrenewable electricity from ovo to bulb to draxs own haven power and opus energy  consumers and businesses have more and greener options than ever about where to buy their electricity with many even offering 100 renewable electricity but how do these companies ensure the megawatts powering homes offices and street lights come from renewable sources cleaning up the river the electricity we use doesnt just flow through a single cable from a power station to our houses it travels through whats called the transmissions system which is run by national grid eso and local distribution network operators  apart from offgrid installations like solar panels on buildings some of which are unable to export their unused power all the electricity generated by different sources around the country goes into this same system it means megawatts generated by a wind turbine get mixed up with those generated by a nuclear reactor or a coal power station think of it as a river although it is its own entity it is fed by multiple streams of water coming from different sources in the case of electricity megawatts from various generators are fed into a central system which then enter homes offices and devices around the country so what makes green power generated from renewable sources green power used in homes suppliers cant control exactly what megawatts you use but they can influence the makeup of the overall river your electricity is pulled from by what electricity they agree to buy and offer to their customers renewable suppliers match the amount of electricity their customers use with the amount they buy from renewable sources so if a home uses 4 megawatthours mwh a year  a supplier will need to ensure it buys an equal amount of power from national grid which national grid sources from generators if that supplier offers 100 renewable power it will need to ensure it has the right kinds of deals in place with renewable generators to deliver that amount of power it means that while the river of electricity is still a mix from different streams more of the water will come from renewable streams therefore if more homes and businesses switch to renewable suppliers more of the overall river will be renewable which will in turn help to decarbonise the electricity system enabling a lowercarbon economy but how does this fit into the existing electricity business and infrastructure but how do suppliers actually buy renewable power from generators the business of electricity to understand how suppliers ensure they are buying renewable power you first need to understand how the business works or at least how it used to the most obvious place to start is with the generators be they gas power stations or an offshore wind farm the generator is where electricity is produced and are often owned by a supplier suppliers can buy electricity from their own generators often months or years ahead of delivery but if there is a shortfall the supplier can also buy electricity on the wholesale market where other generators can sell their electricity because suppliers are on a competitive market their aim is to buy the electricity for the lowest possible price and sell it for more  but at a better rate than rivals measures like carbon prices or green incentives help lower the cost of renewable and lowcarbon generation and position it as a more economically viable purchase than more expensive fossil fuels like coal  renewableonly suppliers also want to buy electricity as cheap as possible and sell it as affordably as possible but unlike standard suppliers they only buy electricity from renewable sources this can be done by purchasing electricity from independent renewable generators on the wholesale market or arranged through what are known as power purchase agreements  ppas   longerterm contracts between generators and suppliers agreeing on a specific amount of power the advantage of these for the renewable generator is it secures revenue for the future while for the supplier it means a dependable source of electricity for large installations these deals are often signed before construction even begins to ensure investors there will be a return transitioning to a lowcarbon electricity system however is not just about suppliers buying more electricity from renewable sources the future of electricity suppliers as more businesses individuals and communities are becoming prosumers and generating their own electricity the wider role of the supplier in the system is changing the governments feedintariffs financially reward customers for generating their own electricity even if they dont export it to the grid but even small generators can sign deals with suppliers to sell electricity through schemes such as good energys smartgen policy which is open to generators with between 10 and 100 kilowatts kw of installed capacity similarly opus energy helps over 2100 businesses sell more than 1100 gigawatthours gwh of excess wind solar anaerobic digestion and hydro power for larger prosumer businesses the relationship with suppliers and the grid is different rather than the traditional buying and selling of electricity it requires a cooperative approach to understand how the prosumer can best utilise their assets  beyond increasing the amount of lowcarbon electricity decarbonising the electricity system also means making more efficient use of energy and managing the data that can help improve efficiency haven powers partnership with thames water sees it analyse an average of 68 million halfhour smart meter readings every year using the data to help the company improve its billing and forecasting as the wider system becomes more intelligent suppliers will be able to better forecast how much electricity its customers use and help them reduce their consumption the role required of suppliers in a changing system will create opportunities for more renewable and efficient use of electricity and empower more consumers to get their electricity from lowcarbon sources that can help to make the whole countrys electricity greener want a different perspective on the same story watch tvs jonny ball explain  tags opus energy  renewable energy  electricity  haven power  customers  wind power  biomass energy where does global electricity go next 12 december 2018 power generation since the paris agreement came into effect in november 2016 its fair to say many countries have taken up the vital challenge of decarbonisation in earnest however not all are making progress at the same rate many are not implementing the agreement at the pace needed to mitigate climate change and keep the average global temperature increase well below 2 o c of preindustrial levels certainly not enough to limit the increase to 15 o c by 2050 which the majority of climate scientists believe is necessary for the planet is to avoid dire consequences last year even saw renewable energy investment fall 7  while the money going into fossil fuels grew for the first time since 2014 and data released by the international energy agency iea at the beginning of this months un climate change conference cop24 in katowice poland found that 2017 was also the first for five years seeing an increase in advanced economies carbon emissions  despite this there is much positive work towards decarbonisation a new report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax looks into the core areas and activities required to decarbonise the global energy system  and which countries are performing them to good effect in doing this the report also looks at how the uk stands in comparison and what steps countries need to take to truly decarbonise here are the key indicators of decarbonisation and how countries around the world are performing towards them dam in hardangervidda norway clean power at the forefront of reducing emissions and curbing climate change is the need to decarbonise electricity generation and move towards renewable sources last year the global average carbon intensity was 440 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatthour gkwh out of the 25 major countries the report tracks 16 came in below average with seven of these falling under the longterm 50 gkwh goal leading the rankings are norway france and new zealand which have a nearzero carbon intensity for electricity generation thanks to extensive hydro and nuclear power capacity at the other end of the table china india poland and south africa remain wedded to coal producing up to twice the global average co 2 for electricity generation this comes despite china having installed two and a half times more renewables than any other country  it now boasts 600 gigawatts gw of renewable capacity per person germany is leading the renewablesdrive with almost 1 kw of wind and solar capacity installed per person over the last decade despite this as much as 40 of its electricity still comes from coal part of the challenge in moving away from coal to renewables is economic as many countries continue to subsidise their coal industries to keep electricity affordable phasing out these subsidies is therefore key to switching to a lowcarbon generation system doing this works as demonstrated by the example of denmark which cut its fossil fuel subsidies by 90 over the past decade in turn successfully cutting its coal generation by 25 the uks carbon pricing strategy  which adds 16 per tonne of co 2 emitted on top of the price set by the european emissions trading system eu ets has led the carbon intensity of great britains electricity to more than halve in a decade it highlights how quickly and effectively these kinds of fees can make fossil fuels uneconomical since 2008 the uk has removed more than 250 gkwh from its electricity production carbon capture and storage in many future looking climate scenarios keeping the earths temperature below a 2 o c increase depends on extensive deployment of carbon capture technology  capturing as much as 100 billion tonnes of co 2 per year storing and using carbon is clearly forecast to be a major part of any attempt to meet the paris agreement but at present there are few facilities carrying it out at scale around the world today there are 18 largescale carbon capture and storage ccs units running across six countries with a total capacity to capture 32 million tonnes of co 2 per year mtco 2 pa another five facilities are under construction in three countries to add another 7 mtco 2 pa of global capacity in the uk drax power station is piloting a bioenergy carbon capture and storage programme that could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station  the usa has the greatest total installed capacity at 20 mtco 2 pa but per person it ranks behind norway canada and australia their smaller populations give them more than 200 kg of carbon capture capacity per person per year oil platform off the coast of australia these figures are well below the 100 billion tonnes the iea estimates need to be stored by 2060 to prevent temperatures reaching 2 o c more however considering the us alone has a potential storage capacity of more than 10 trillion tonnes of co 2  the potential of storage is not expected to be a problem using depleted oil or natural gas fields as storage for captured carbon is being explored in a number of regions with the us establishing several projects with more than 1 million tonnes in capacity in 2019 australia will open the worlds largest co 2 store with the capacity to capture between 34 million and 4 million tonnes a year from chevrons gorgon gas facility  considering the storage capacity available globally its a matter of deploying the necessary technology for ccs to have a significant impact on emissions and global warming the uk is perhaps a typical example of where ccs is at present with estimated storage capacity of 70 billion tonnes as much as half of the entire eu combined by repurposing north sea oil and gas fields in partnership with norway the uk could pool its carbon storage capacity electrification electricity generation is one of the main targets for emissions reductions globally as a result of the progress thats been made in this field many futurelooking scenarios highlight the important of electrification in other sectors such as transport in turn making them less carbon intensive transport is leading the charge globally  there are now 10 different countries where one of every 50 new vehicles sold is electric in norway this ratio is almost one in two thanks in part to generous tax exemptions as well as nonfinancial incentives like access to bus lanes and halfprice ferries perhaps surprisingly china is the worlds largest electric vehicle ev market it may still use significant amounts of coal but its commitment to reducing urban air pollution has seen it push evs heavily and it now accounts for 50 of the global battery ev market on its own chinese electric car charging stations of course adoption of evs requires the supporting infrastructure to be truly successful in conjunction with its high sales norway leads the way in charging points per capita with one for every 500 people this compares to one charger for every 5000 people in the uk and one for every 10000 people in china electrification also affects the energy intensity of countrys transport systems and while it may be the largest ev market chinas rise in private vehicles has been largely driven by petrol and diesel models the result is the largest increases in transport energy intensity and emissions has taken place in china indonesia and india respectively domestic energy intensity is also rising in china indonesia and south africa as greater numbers of people gain access to appliances and home comforts conversely in europe portugal germany and the netherlands have all seen their domestic energy intensity drop in the last decade however this may be the lingering effect of the 2008 recession rather than longterm efficiency improvements the efficiency of industrial processes is also an important barometer in decarbonisation activities like mining and manufacturing require heavyduty dieselpowered machinery and often coalpowered generators especially in bric nations the exception is china where plans to get the 1000 most energyintensive companies to reduce their energy consumption per unit of gdp produced by 20 over the last five years has proved fruitful norways heavilyelectrified industries however are still energy intensive and its level of carbon intensity is vulnerable to fluctuations in power generation prices electrification and reduced emissions require government policies to put in motion behavioural changes that can lead to lasting decarbonisation  robust carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future  drax group ceo will gardiner commented recently  welcoming
