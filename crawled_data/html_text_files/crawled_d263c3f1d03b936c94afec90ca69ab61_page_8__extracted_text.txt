hollow mountain power station 17 may 2022 press releases plans submitted by renewable energy company drax to expand cruachan power station in scotland will support uk energy security reduce energy costs and cut carbon emissions by enabling more renewable power to be used by homes and businesses the new power station could be operational as soon as 2030 with construction work getting underway in 2024 removing around 2 million tonnes of rock from inside ben cruachan and creating hundreds of jobs across scotland the development  which could be the first newly constructed plant of its kind in the uk in more than 40 years  will provide critical storage capacity to strengthen the uks energy security and enable net zero it will be a major infrastructure project which will support around 900 jobs during six years of construction across the supply chain in a range of industries from quarrying and engineering to transport and hospitality around 150 onsite local construction jobs will be created during the development the up to 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the plant will be housed within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side around two million tonnes of rock will be excavated to create the cavern tunnels and other parts of the power station the hollow mountain  cruachans generating units are housed inside the mountain the new plant could be operational in 2030 providing critical stability services to the power system by acting like a giant water battery it will use reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand and then use this stored water to generate renewable power when it is needed a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants can play a major role in reducing emissions and significantly cutting the uks reliance on imported gas through their storage and flexibility services wind farms are routinely paid to turn off when supply outstrips demand or there is insufficient capacity on the national grid transmission system due to a lack of energy storage creating local bottlenecks in 2020 enough wind power to supply around a million homes went to waste because of this ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director standing infront of a generating unit in the existing cruachan cavern ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said draxs plan to expand cruachan will strengthen the uks energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to come online to power homes and businesses across the country helping to end our reliance on imports and cut costs this major infrastructure project will support hundreds of jobs and provide a real boost to the scottish economy only by investing in longduration storage technologies can the uk reach its full renewable potential and drax is ready to move mountains to do just that claire mack scottish renewables chief executive said  pumped storage hydro is a critical technology needed to meet net zero over the last decade we have managed to develop the technologies to decarbonise the power system such as wind and solar but what we really need now is greater flexibility to fully optimise those technologies thats why the success of longduration storage projects such as cruachan 2 is absolutely vital to scotland and the whole of the uk draxs plans to expand cruachan has also won support from former australian prime minister malcolm turnbull during his time in office mr turnbull announced the construction of snowy hydro 20  the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the southern hemisphere he is now a board member of the international hydropower association and cochair of the international forum on pumped storage hydropower commenting on draxs exciting expansion plans mr turnbull said  within the climate crisis the world is facing an ignored crisis  how to ensure that we do not fall back on fossil fuels when the wind isnt blowing and the sun isnt shining we need green energy security solutions and draxs plans to expand cruachan will enable the uk to enhance its energy security and enable more renewable power to come online in order to deploy this critical technology drax must secure consent under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 from the scottish government  a process which will take around one year to complete from the applications submission alongside a successful section 36 application the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the existing lack of a framework for longduration electricity storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation infographic  how pumped storage hydro works click to viewdownload ends media contacts ben wicks media manager beccs and customers e email protected t 07761 525 662 editors notes with section 36 consent from the scottish government and an updated revenue stabilisation mechanism from the uk government work to build the new pumped storage hydro power station could get underway in 2024 with it becoming operational supplying flexible power to the grid in 2030 no investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework with the uk government longduration electricity storage can be defined as technologies that are able to respond to supply and demand variations caused by daily peaks weather events and seasonal patterns providing power for more than four hours at their full capacity the uk governments 2021 smart systems and flexibility plan recognised longduration storage as essential for achieving net zero the government held a call for evidence to hear the industrys views on derisking investment at the end of 2021 and aims to evaluate options and respond this year a recent report by aurora showed that the uk may need an eightfold increase in longduration electricity storage capacity by 2035 the last pumped storage hydro plants to be built in the uk was dinorwig in 1984  none have followed since the privatisation of the electricity markets despite their vital role in enabling more renewable power to come online no others have been built due to the barriers that exist to securing private investment in projects a number of options exist for reforming the market to incentivise longduration electricity storage with a report published in january by kpmg recommending a cap and floor

capture and storage ministerial roundtable seeks to unlock investment in uk energy storage 18 march 2022 press releases business leaders have met with uk energy minister the rt hon greg hands mp to discuss how the government could unlock significant investment in vital energy storage technologies needed to decarbonise the power sector and help ensure greater energy independence the meeting was organised by the longduration electricity storage alliance a new association of companies progressing plans across a range of technologies to be first of their kind to be developed in the uk for decades representatives from drax  sse renewables highview power and invinity energy systems met with the rt hon greg hands mp minister of state for business energy and clean growth on thursday he heard how decarbonising the uks electricity system by 2035 will require a range of flexible homegrown longduration energy storage ldes technologies to strengthen the contribution of cheap but variable renewables and deliver enhanced system stability a recent report by aurora showed that the uk may need an eightfold increase in longduration electricity storage capacity by 2035 as such ldes technologies will not only play a major role in significantly reducing the uks reliance on imported gas and supporting the uk governments ambitions to supercharge renewables but they will also deliver massive efficiency gains to the uk grid  helping to lower consumer energy bills the longduration electricity storage alliance intends to work with the uk government to unlock potential developments in new pumped storage hydro capacity and to accelerate the commercial deployment of exciting emerging technologies such as liquid air energy storage and flow batteries to put the uk in the vanguard of ldes innovation following the meeting greg hands mp said the longduration electricity storage alliance is a key part of our plan to get the full benefit from our worldclass renewables sector government have already committed 68 million of funding toward the development of these technologies this will support the uk as we shift towards domesticallyproduced renewable energy that will boost our energy security and create jobs and investment will gardiner drax group ceo said  enough renewable electricity from wind to supply around a million uk homes is wasted each year because there isnt enough storage available to harness that power and ensure it is available when we need it we cannot afford to allow that to continue especially with current concerns around energy security drax has plans to invest 500m developing 600 mw of additional pumped storage hydro capacity at our cruachan power station in the west of scotland  a project which with the right policies from government will not only contribute to uk energy security but also deliver around 1000 jobs in rural areas during construction finlay mccutcheon sse renewables director of onshore europe said in response to the current situation in the energy markets the uk needs to not only supercharge cheap renewables but also homegrown longduration storage technologies to costeffectively decarbonise the grid and reduce our dependence on imported gas the swift introduction of an adapted cap  floor mechanism by government this year could unlock billions of pounds of investment in these vital technologies and create thousands of skilled jobs as the uks clean energy champion with our consented and shovelready 1500 mw coire glas pumped storage project in the scottish highlands we stand ready to play our part rupert pearce highview power ceo added  highview powers liquid air energy storage technology is ready for commercial deployment and we believe that it can make a substantial contribution to the uks net zero ambitions for the uk grid as we move into the delivery phase for our matured technology we recognise that the uk leads the world in innovation in the uk grid and has already made extraordinary strides in admitting renewables to its system we are very grateful for the uk governments strong interest in ldes and their willingness to engage with uk industry to accelerate and embed key ldes capabilities in the uk economy and to create uk leaders in a fastemerging global ldes marketplace larry zulch ceo of invinity energy systems said wind and solar power will clearly play an increasing role in the uks longterm energy security reducing reliance on imported gas and supporting climate goals renewable energy requires energy storage to fill in the missing hours and make zerocarbon electricity available when it is needed not just when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining the more dependent the uk is on renewables the more urgent it is that longduration energy storage such as that provided by invinitys vanadium flow batteries be made available we couldnt be more pleased to see the uk take a leadership role in the deployment of long duration energy storage projects and welcome

achieving net zero the government held a call for evidence to hear the industrys views on derisking investment which closed in september 2021 and aims to evaluate options and respond early this year a recent report from aurora energy research showed that up to 24 gw of longduration electricity storage  equivalent to eight times the current installed capacity  could be needed to integrate wind power
