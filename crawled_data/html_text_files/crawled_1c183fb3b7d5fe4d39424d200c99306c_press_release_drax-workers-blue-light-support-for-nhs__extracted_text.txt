drax power station near selby in north yorkshire have installed blue lighting on one of the 12 114m tall cooling towers at the 1850acre site in honour of the nhs michael davies a section head in the maintenance team at drax power station who led a team of engineers from drax emi and yess electrical to install the blue lights said michael davies section head maintenance team drax power station who

seven days a week these people are putting themselves in harms way to protect us and look after those worst affected by this disease lighting up one of our cooling towers is our signal to those working in the nhs to let them know we appreciate what theyre doing we know they must be working incredibly hard in very difficult circumstances and we fully support them drax power station has the capacity to generate enough electricity for up to six million households measures have been put in place to ensure its employees can work safely and continue operating this critical national

cooling tower facts each of the 12 cooling towers at drax are 114m tall and 93m in diameter at the base you could fit the statue of liberty inside each one the dimensions of the cooling towers are such that if they were scaled down to be the size of an egg the thickness of the cooling tower walls would be the same as an eggshell  so whilst the walls could be viewed as being quite delicate the hyperboloid shape of the cooling towers gives them strength to withstand harsh weather conditions the ones at drax date from almost 50 years ago when the first half of the power station was built and came into operation in 1974 a common misconception is that the cooling towers release smoke  this is not true its actually steam or water vapour which can be seen rising from them power stations use a lot of water draxs 12 cooling towers draw 160 million litres of water each day from the river ouse the power station works by using boilers to heat water and make high pressure steam which is used to spin turbines and generate electricity the steam is then cooled inside the cooling towers and the water is returned to the boiler to be heated again about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more
