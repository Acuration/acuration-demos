sustainability the key to sustainable forests thinking globally and managing locally 1 december 2022 sustainable bioenergy key takeaways working forests where wood products are harvested are explicitly managed to balance environmental and economic benefits while encouraging healthy growing forests that store carbon provide habitats for wildlife and space for recreation but there is no single management technique the most effective methods vary depending on local conditions by employing locally appropriate methods working forests have grown while supporting essential forestry industries and local economies forests in the us south british columbia and estonia all demonstrate how local management can deliver both environmental and economic wins forests are biological environmental and economic powerhouses collectively they are home to most of the planets terrestrial biodiversity they are responsible for absorbing 76 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  equivalent per year or roughly 15 times the amount of co 2 produced by the united states on an annual basis and working forests which are actively managed to generate revenue from wood products industries are important drivers for the global economy employing over 13 million people worldwide and generating 600 billion annually  but as important as forests are globally the key to maximizing working forests potential lies in smart active forest management while 420 million hectares of forest have been lost since 1990 through conversion to other land uses such as for agriculture many working forests are actually growing both larger and healthier due to sciencebased management practices the best practices in working forests balance economic social and environmental benefits but just as importantly they are tailored to local conditions and framed by appropriate regional regulations guidance and bestpractice the following describes how three different regions from which drax sources its biomass manage their forests for a sustainable future british columbia managing locally for global climate change british columbia is blanketed by almost 60 million hectares of forest  an area larger than france and germany combined over 90 of the forest land is owned by canadas government meaning the provinces forests are managed for the benefit of the canadian people and in collaboration with first nations from the provinces expanse of forested land less than half a percent 036 is harvested each year according to government figures  this ensures stable sustainable forests however theres a need to manage against natural factors click to viewdownload in 2017 2018 and 2020 catastrophic fires ripped through some of british columbias most iconic forest areas underscoring the threat climate change poses to the areas natural resources one response was to increase the removal of stands of trees in the forest harvesting the large number of dead or dying trees created by pests that have grown more common in a warming climate by removing dead trees diseased trees and even some healthy trees forest managers can reduce the amount of potential fuel in the forest making devastating wildfires less likely there are also commercial advantages to this strategy most of the trees removed are low quality and not suitable for processing into lumber these trees can however still be used commercially to produce biomass wood pellets that offer a renewable alternative to fossil fuels this means local communities dont just get safer forests they get safer forests that support the local economy the united states  thinning for healthier forests the us souths forests have expanded rapidly in recent decades largely due to growth in working forests on private land annual forest growth in the region more than doubled from 193 million cubic metres of wood in 1953 to 408 million cubic meters by 2015  this expansion has occurred thanks to active forest product markets which incentivise forest management investment in the southern us thinning is critical to managing healthy and productive pine forests thinning is an intermediate harvest aimed at reducing tree density to allocate more resources like nutrients sunlight and water to trees which will eventually become valuable sawtimber thinning not only increases future sawtimber yields but also improves the forests resilience to pest disease and wildfire as well as enhancing understory diversity and wildlife habitat click to viewdownload while trees removed during thinning are generally undersized or unsuitable for lumber theyre ideal for producing biomass wood pellets in this way the biomass market creates an incentive for managers to engage in practices that increase the health and vigour of forests on their land the results speak for themselves across us forestland the volume of annual net timber growth 36 higher than the volume of annual timber removals a managed working forest in the us south estonia seeding the future though estonia is not a large country approximately half of it is covered in trees meaning forestry is integral to the countrys way of life historically harvesting trees has been an important part of the national economy and the government has established strict laws to ensure sustainable management practices these regulations have helped estonia increase its overall forest cover from about 34 80 years ago to over 50 today  and as in the us south the volume of wood harvested from estonias forests each year is less than the volume added by tree growth sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia estonia has managed to increase its growing forest stock by letting the average age of its forests increase this is partially due to estonia having young fastgrowing forests in areas where tree growth is relatively new but it is also due to regulations that require harvesters to leave seed trees seed trees are healthy mature trees the seeds from which become the forests next generation by enforcing laws that ensure seed trees are not harvested estonia is encouraging natural regeneration of forests as in the us south protecting these seed trees from competition for water and nutrients means removing smaller trees in the area while these smaller trees may not all be suitable for lumber they are a suitable feedstock for biomass it means managing for natural regeneration can still have economic as well as environmental advantages different methods similar results laws landownership and forestry practices differ greatly between the us south british columbia and estonia but all three are excellent examples of how local forest management contributes to healthy rural economies and sustained forest coverage while there are many different strategies for creating a balance between economic and environmental interests all successful strategies have something in common they encourage healthy growing forests tags biomass  forestry and forest management and arboriculture  sustainable biomass program sbp  sustainability  biomass energy supporting a circular economy in the forests alan knight group director of sustainability 16 june 2022 opinion every year in british columbia millions of tonnes of waste wood  known in the industry as slash  is burned by the side of the road land managers are required by law to dispose of this waste wood  that includes leftover tree limbs and tops and wood that is rotten diseased and already fire damaged  to reduce the risks of wildfires and the spread of disease and pests the smoke from these fires is choking surrounding communities  sometimes smoking out entire valleys air quality meteorologist from bcs environment ministry trina orchard recently told infonewsca it also impacts the broader environment releasing some 3 million tonnes of co 2 a year into the atmosphere according to some early estimates slash pile in british columbia landfilling this waste material from logging operations isnt an option as it would emit methane  a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more potent than co 2  so you can see why it ends up being burned in its modernizing forest policy in bc the government has already identified its intention to phase out the burning of this waste wood left over after harvesting operations and is working with suppliers and other companies to encourage the use of this fibre this is a very positive move as this material must come out of the forests to reduce the fuel load that can help wildfires grow and spread to the point where they cant be controlled let alone be extinguished the wildfire risk is real and growing each year more forests and land are destroyed by wildfire impacting communities nature wildlife and the environment in the past two decades wildfires burned two and a half times more land in bc than in the previous 50year period according to very early estimates emissions from last years wildfires in the province released around 150 million tonnes of co 2  equivalent to around 30 million cars on the road for a year alan knight at the log yard for lavington pellet mill in british columbia during my recent trip to british columbia in canada first nations foresters academics scientists and government officials all talked about the burning piles of waste wood left over after logging operations rather than burning it it would be far better they say to use more of this potential resource as a feedstock for pellets that can be used to generate renewable energy while supporting local jobs across the forestry sector and helping bolster the resilience of canadas forests against wildfire i like this approach because it brings pragmatism and common sense to the debate over canadas forests from the very people who know the most about the landscape around them burning it at the roadside is a waste of a resource that could be put to much better use in generating renewable electricity displacing fossil fuels and it highlights the positive role the bioenergy industry can play in enhancing the forests and supporting communities drax is already using some of this waste wood  which i saw in the log yard for our lavington pellet mill in british columbia this waste wood comprises around 20 of our feedstock the remaining 80 comes from sawmill residues like sawdust chips and shavings waste wood for pellets at lavington pellet mill log yard its clear to me that using this waste material that has little other use or market value to make our pellets is an invaluable opportunity to deliver real benefits for communities jobs and the environment while supporting a sustainable circular economy in the forestry sector tags biomass energy  sustainability  wood pellets  forests

sustainability  customers  decarbonisation  net zero an introduction to carbon accounting 12 may 2022 sustainable business key takeaways tracking reporting and calculating carbon emissions are a key part of progressing countries industries and companies towards net zero goals as a newly established discipline carbon accounting still lacks standardisation and frameworks in how emissions are tracked reduced and mitigated the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol which lays out three scopes businesses should report and act upon carbon accounting evolves from reporting in the use of goals and timeframes in which targets are met timeframes are crucial in the deployment of technologies like carbon capture removals and achieving net zero how can countries and companies find a route to net zero emissions many organisations countries and industries have pledged to balance their emissions before midcentury they intend to do this through a combination of cutting emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere tracking and quantifying emissions understanding output reducing them and setting tangible targets that can be worked towards are all central to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  especially when it comes to carbon dioxide co 2  emissions and energy consumption reporting is already common practice and compulsory for businesses over a certain size in the uk however carbon accounting takes this a step further carbon reporting is a statement of physical greenhouse gas emissions that occur over a given period explains michael goldsworthy head of climate change and carbon strategy at drax carbon accounting relates to how those emissions are then processed and counted towards specific targets the methodologies for calculating emissions and determining contributions against targets may then have differing rules depending on which framework or standard is being reported against carbon accounting tools can help companies and counties understand their carbon footprint  how much carbon is being emitted as part of their operations who is responsible for them and how they can be effectively mitigated like how financial accounting may seek to balance a companys books and calculate potential profit carbon accounting seeks to do the same with emissions tracking what an entity emits and what it reduces removes or mitigates carbon accounting is therefore crucial in understanding how countries and companies can contribute to reaching net zero a new space how different organisations countries and industries approach carbon accounting is still an evolving process its as complex as financial accounting but with financial accounting theres a long standing industry that relies on wellestablished practices and principles carbon accounting by contrast is such a new space explains goldsworthy regardless of its infancy businesses and countries are already implementing standardised approaches to carbon accounting regulations such as emissions trading schemes and reporting systems such as streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr and the taskforce on climate related financial disclosure tcfd are beginning to deliver some degree of consistency in businesses carbon reporting other standards such as the ghg protocol have sought to provide a standardised basis for corporate reporting and accounting elsewhere voluntary carbon markets eg carbon offsets have also evolved to allow transferral of carbon reductions or removals between businesses providing flexibility to companies in delivering their climate commitments the challenge is in aligning these frameworks so that they work together for example emissions within a corporate inventory or offset programme must be accounted for in a way that is consistent with a national inventory to date these accounting systems have evolved independently with different rules and methodologies beginning to implement detailed carbon accounting upon which emissions reductions and removals can be based requires standardised understanding of what they are and where they come from reporting and tackling scope one two and three emissions the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol  this voluntary carbon reporting standard can be used by countries and cities as well as individual companies globally the ghg protocol categorises emissions in three different scopes called scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 understanding measuring and reporting these is a key factor in carbon accounting and can drive meaningful emissions reduction and mitigation scope one  direct emissions scope one emissions are those that come as a direct result of a company or countrys activities these can include fuel combustion at a factorys facilities for example or emissions from a fleet of vehicles scope one emissions are the most straightforward for an organisation to measure and report and easier for organisations to directly act on scope two  indirect energy emissions scope two emissions are those which come from the generation of energy an organisation uses these can include emissions form electricity steam heating and cooling a business may buy electricity for example from an electricity supplier which acquires power from a generator if that generator is a fossilfuelled power station the energy consumers scope two emissions will be greater than if it buys power from a renewable electricity supplier or generates its own renewable power the ability to change energy suppliers makes scope two relatively straightforward for organisations to act on assuming renewable energy sources are available in the area scope three  all other indirect emissions scope three is much broader it covers upstream and downstream lifecycle emissions of products used or produced by a company as well as other indirect emissions such as employee commuting and business travel emissions identifying and reducing these emissions across supply and value chains can be difficult for businesses with complex supply lines and global distribution networks they are also hard for companies to directly influence add in factors like emissions mitigations or offsetting and the carbon accounting can quickly become much more complex than simply reporting and reducing emissions that occur directly from a companys activities nevertheless these fullsystem overviews and wholeproduct lifecycle accounting are crucial to understanding the true impact of operations and organisations and to reach climate goals working to timelines setting goals with defined timelines and the development of rules that ensure consistent accounting is also crucial to implementing effective climate change mitigation frameworks throughout the global economy consider the uks aim to be net zero by 2050 or draxs ambition to be net negative by 2030 as goals with set timelines for many technologies the time scales over which targets are set have added relevance there are often upfront emissions to account for and operational emissions that may change over time take for example an electric vehicle the climate benefit will be determined by emissions from construction and the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power it a timeline of beccs at drax click to viewdownload looking at a brief snapshot at the beginning of its life say the first couple of years might not show any climate benefit compared to a vehicle using an internal combustion engine over the lifetime of the vehicle however meaningful emissions savings may become clear  especially if the electricity powering the vehicle continues to decarbonise over time this provides a challenge when setting carbon emissions targets targets set too far in the future potentially risk inaction in the short term while targets set over short periods risk disincentivising technologies that have substantial longterm mitigation potential delivering net zero some greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to fully abate such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture while other sectors like aviation will be incredibly difficult to fully decarbonise this makes carbon removal technologies all the more critical to ensuring net zero is achieved technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  which combines lowcarbon biomassfuelled renewable power generation with carbon capture and storage ccs to permanently remove emissions from the atmosphere  are already under development however it is imperative that such technologies are accounted for using robust approaches to carbon accounting ensuring all emission and removals flows across the value chain are accurately calculated in accordance with best scientific practice in the case of beccs its vital that not only are emissions from processing and transporting biomass considered but also its potential impact on the land sector forests from which biomass is sourced will be managed for a variety of reasons such as mitigating natural disturbance delivering commercial returns and preserving ecosystems accurate accounting of these impacts is therefore key to ensuring such technologies deliver meaningful reductions in atmospheric co 2 within timeframes guided by science accounting for net zero while carbon accounting is crucial to reaching a true level of net zero in the uk and globally where residual emissions are balanced against removals the practice should not be used exclusively to deliver numerical carbon goals to deliver net zero its vital we have robust carbon accounting systems and targets in place ensuring we reduce fossil emissions as far as possible while also incentivising carbon removal solutions says goldsworthy however many removal solutions rely on the natural world and so it is critical that ecosystems are not only valued on a carbon basis but consider other environmental factors such as biodiversity as well tags sustainability  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture cruachan power station protecting biodiversity while generating power 1 april 2022 sustainable business key points the scottish highlands are home to a wide variety of landscapes with a wealth of biodiversity that must be preserved cruachan pumped storage hydro station sits within ben cruachan and has operated for nearly 60years without damaging wildlife regular surveys and reporting allow drax to understand the health of different fauna and species over time its promising that even species of bird and insects that are declining in other parts of the uk are regularly spotted around cruachan the expansion of the power station has required and will continue to need careful assessment of the areas biodiversity to minimise any impact the project could cause the scottish highlands are home to some of the uks most stunning natural wonders from dramatic plunging lochs to the craggy ice capped munros the varied landscape holds some of the most biodiverse areas in the uk the regions fauna ranges from red deer to golden eagles while its flora includes the ancient oak and mosscovered forests that make up the temperate rainforest of the atlantic coast preserving these landscapes and the life that thrives in them is crucial to both the environment and economy of the region its the job of roddy davies health safety and environmental advisor at draxs cruachan power station to ensure operations at the site do not damage the natural environment this is a very biodiverse rich environment there are a lot of different species a large variety of natural habitats and plant life says davies its good that we can say weve operated here for nearly 60 years and all of that is still there its testament that we dont have a demonstrable negative effect on the wildlife that lives around us source blue leaf nature energy storage inside a mountain the pumped storage hydro station sits a kilometre inside ben cruachan a munro peak in the western highland region of argyll and bute its not an area you would normally associate with power generation but its perfect for pumped storage hydro the site has two bodies of water at differing elevations loch awe at the bottom and a reservoir at the top allowing cruachan to generate power when its needed as well as absorb electricity when there is an excess on the grid by pumping water back up the mountain storing it until power is needed and helping to keep the grid balanced the subterranean nature of the power station means the massive machinery including the four reversible turbines and the heat and noise they generate is hidden underground features on the surface are limited to a few buildings by the entrance tunnel at the banks of loch awe and the dam which contains the upper reservoir on the slopes of ben cruachan as well as several pylons and cables transporting electricity even the 316metre buttress dam takes the landscape into account when cruachan was built in the 50s and 60s the visual impact of it was very much in the minds of the people who built it and the authorities who approved it the dam is almost impossible to see from a public place explains davies our presence on the surface is very limited all the busy goingson are underground theres lots of noise underground but it doesnt travel outside ensuring that the area surrounding draxs operation continues to function without damaging the surrounding environment is an ongoing process davies deploys annual biodiversity surveys and reporting that gives drax over a decade of information and analysis to help identify trends the wildlife of ben cruachan the cruachan power station biodiversity survey for 2021 is the 11 th completed by blue leaf nature a biodiversity service provider the comprehensive report highlights the incredible diversity of fauna surrounding cruachan some of which are declining in other parts of the country while the majestic red stags found in other parts of the highlands are extremely uncommon around cruachan 2021 was a particularly exciting year for other types of large mammals pine martens  a catsized relative of the weasel  are relatively common appearing alongside red squirrels red foxes and otters badgers were also added to the sites list of species for the first time source blue leaf nature mammals however are exceeded by the range of birds found around cruachan with 53 different species spotted in 2021 of these 17 species appear on the birds of conservation concern fives red list the highest threat status to the uks bird population including the ring ouzel yellowhammer and tree pipet a further 27 appear on the regional international union for the conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species additionally six of the spotted species are considered endangered including herring gull and northern wheatear and 11 vulnerable by the iucn sightings of these threatened species around cruachan come despite particularly unfavourable weather in 2021 one of the driest aprils on record followed by an exceptionally wet may disrupted the bird breeding season this in turn resulted in a difficult nesting season exacerbated by food shortages due to the weathers effect on insect life in the reports survey of invertebrates 150 different species were recorded in 2021 down from 170 in 2018 however its promising that among cruachans creepycrawlies are many that are in decline elsewhere in the uk with the numbers of some important insect types are increasing dragonfly and damselfly species for example increased from five in the previous survey to nine in 2021 moths and butterflies are particularly important to monitor as davies explains theyre a very strong indicator species for the health and quality of an ecosystem theyre also very sensitive to climatic changes and react quickly to temperature change source blue leaf nature in 2021 78 moth species were recorded around cruachan including one of butterfly conservations noted priority species yellowringed carpet as well as six species that feature on iucns red or amber lists there were 11 butterfly species recorded in 2021 including four priority species as well as two newly spotted species the small copper and the chequered skipper that species in decline around the country are increasingly thriving at cruachan is further testament to the power stations lack of disruption to the environment and as the uks electricity system continues to evolve and cruachan power station with it closely observing the surrounding environment and its inhabitants will become even more important expanding cruachan while preserving nature while cruachan first started generating and storing power in the 1960s its capabilities are becoming ever more critical as the national grid decarbonises and power generation becomes increasingly decentralised this is why drax is undertaking an ambitious project to expand cruachan cruachan 2 would add a further 600 mw of generation capacity to the plant for a total of 104 gw of power by providing stability services to the grid the expansion could enable an additional 300gigawatt hours of renewable power to come online source blue leaf nature the project is epic in scale new underground tunnels and subterranean caverns will house the reversible pumpturbines and will be carved out of the mountain vastly increasing the size of the power station but as with any activity in such a landscape careful planning is essential detailed surveys and assessments of the area are a key requirement for planning approval we need to acknowledge whats here and show that we understand what surveys have found says davies then we have to present our proposals for how we will protect them and mitigate any potential disturbance an advantage of pumped storage hydro is that much of the intensive excavating and construction work will take place underground with little disturbance on the surface cruachan 2 has the added benefit of utilising cruachans existing infrastructure for example it would not require flooding a valley to create a new upper reservoir ultimately cruachans half centuryplus of operation has not damaged or degraded the biodiversity of the western highlands landscape and davies is keen to ensure that legacy is

capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are

of timberland in the alabama cluster catchment area has remained stable over the last 20 years increasing slightly from 408 million ha to 416 million ha an increase of 79 thousand hectares this area represents 796 of the total land area in 2020 up from 781 in 2020 the total area of forestland and woodland was 86 of the catchment area in 2020 with farmland making up 13 and urban areas 1 this land base can be considered to be heavily forested and dominated by timberland figure 1 land use type  alabama cluster the timberland area is classified by growth rate potential capable of achieving a minimum of 057 m 3 hayear more than 95 of the timberland area is in private ownership this proportion has remained stable since 2000 as shown in figure 2 figure 2 timberland ownership profile  alabama cluster the total standing volume the amount of carbon stored in the forest area has increased by 115 million m 3 since 2000 an increase of 30 most of this increase has occurred since 2010 with 90 million m 3 added to the inventory since this time reflecting the maturing age class of the forest resource as it passes through the peak growth phase almost all of this increase has been in the softwood pine forest area with a combined increase of 86 million m 3 since 2010 pine sawtimber and chipnsaw both increased by 46 since 2010 and pine pulpwood by 25 over the same period suggesting that the average tree size is getting larger as the forest matures figure 3 standing volume by product class  alabama cluster one measure of the sustainability of harvesting levels is to compare average annual growth against removals this comparison gives a growth drain ratio gdr where removals are equal to or lower than growth a gdr of 1 or more this is a measure of sustainability where the ratio falls below 1 this can indicate that harvesting levels are not sustainable in the longterm figure 4 shows that all pine product classes have a positive gdr since 2010 in particular the pine pulpwood gdr ratio is in excess of 2 suggesting that there is a substantial surplus of this product category by contrast the hardwood gdr for both sawtimber and pulpwood are both lower than 1 suggesting that harvesting levels for hardwood species should be reduced until growth can recover figure 4 growth drain ratio by product class  alabama cluster figure 5 shows the maturing age class of the forest area charting the change in annual surplus and deficit in each product class the trend shows that harvesting of pine sawtimber from 2000 to 2008 represented a deficit of growth compared to harvesting removals this indicates an immature forest resource with a low quantity of forest categorised as sawtimber therefore harvesting volume in mature stands outweighed the growth in midrotation stands as the forest aged and more standing timber grew into the sawtimber category the surplus of annual growth compared to removals increased sawtimber growth in 2020 was 3 million m 3 higher than in 2000 the surplus of pine pulpwood has remained positive and has increased substantially from 3 million m 3 in 2000 to 65 million m 3 in 2020 despite harvesting levels increasing slightly over this period figure 5 annual surplusdeficit of growth and removal by product class  alabama cluster biomass demand began in 2008 at a very small scale representing just 05 of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area from around 2013 it began to increase and reached peak in 2015 with a total demand of 724000 tons of pulpwood in that year representing 81 of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area after that time demand for pulpwood declined as pellet mills switched to mill residuals the latest data on pulpwood demand shows that the biomass sectors made up just 28 of total pulpwood demand in 2020 with just over 216000 tonnes of total demand this demonstrates that the biomass and wood pellet sector is a very small component of the market in this region and unlikely to influence forest management decision making as shown in figure 6 figure 6 pulpwood demand by market  alabama cluster pine pulpwood stumpage prices have declined significantly since a peak in 2013 falling from an annual high of 946 when demand was strongest to just 412 in 2020 as demand for pine pulpwood declined in 2020 pine sawtimber prices have seen a similar decline from a high point in the early 2000s to a plateau from 2011 onwards sawtimber stumpage more than halved in value over this period from 49 per ton to 22 per ton this can have a significant impact on forest management objectives and decision making figure 7 stumpage price change by product category  alabama cluster detailed below are the summary findings from hood consulting on the impact of biomass demand on key issues in the alabama cluster catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows that total timberland area has held steady and averaged roughly 4172000 hectares in the alabama cluster catchment area since alabama pelletsaliceville started up in late2012 more importantly planted pine timberland the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production has increased more than 75000 hectares 49 in the catchment area since alabama pellets startup in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however the evidence is inconclusive as to whether increased demand attributed to bioenergy has caused or is responsible for those changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that the prevalence of thinnings temporarily increased in the alabama cluster market from 20072013 due to the weakening of pine sawtimber markets specifically challenging market conditions saw pine sawtimber stumpages prices decline from an average of 47 per ton from 20002006 to just over 23 per ton in 2011 or a roughly 50 decrease from 20002006 average levels this led many landowners to refrain from clearcutting a type of harvest which typically removes large quantities of pine sawtimber as they waited for pine sawtimber prices to improve however pine sawtimber stumpage prices never recovered and have held between 22 and 25 per ton since 2011 ultimately landowners returned to more normal management practices by 2014 with thinnings falling back in line with pre2007 trends the catchment area has also experienced some conversion specifically from 20002020 planted pine timberland increased more than 460000 hectares while natural hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland decreased a combined 390000 hectares note that the increase in planted pine timberland and decrease in natural hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland over this period were both gradual and occurred simultaneously this suggests a management trend in which natural timber stands are converted to plantation pine following final harvest its also important to note that there is little evidence that links these changes to increased demand from bioenergy as this conversion trend begun years prior to the startup of alabama pellets and continued nearly unchanged following the pellet mills startup diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 12 in the catchment area from 20122020 also there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused a diversion from other softwood pulpwood markets ie pulppaper also even though softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy is down 14 since alabama pelletsalicevilles startup in 2012 there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused this decrease rather the decrease in demand from nonbioenergy sources is due to a combination of reduced product demand and therefore reduced production and increased utilization of sawmill residuals an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices no the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville added roughly 450000 metric tons of softwood pulpwood demand to the catchment area from 20122016 and this increase in demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood ppw price over this same period ultimately the additional demand placed on the catchment area following the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville was offset by a decrease in demand from other sources from 20122016 and as a result delivered ppw prices remained nearly unchanged however the aliceville facility was shut down for a majority of 2017 due to the catastrophic failure of a key piece of environmental equipment and this was followed by alabama pellets strategic decision to transition to residualconsumption only beginning in 2018 which eliminated more than 360000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from 20162018 over this same period softwood pulpwood demand from other sources also decreased nearly 360000 metric tons so with the elimination of roughly 720000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from all sources from 20162018 delivered ppw prices in the catchment area proceeded to decrease more than 6 over this period since 2018 total softwood pulpwood demand has increased roughly 4 in the catchment area due to increases in demand from nonbioenergy sources and this increase that has coincided with a simultaneous 4 increase in delivered ppw price statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however the relationship between delivered ppw price and nonbiomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94 of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012 ultimately the findings provide evidence that ppw price is influenced by demand from all sources  not just from bioenergy or from pulppaper but from both furthermore note that alabama pellets shift to residualconsumption only beginning in 2018 resulted in no increase in pine sawmill chip prices as the price of pine sawmill chips in the alabama cluster catchment area rather decreased from 20182020 despite a more than 100000metric ton increase in pine sawmill chip consumption by the aliceville mill over this period a reduction in growing stock timber no from 2012 the year alabama pellets started up to 2020 total growing stock inventory increased an average of 26 per year 22 total in the alabama cluster catchment area specifically inventories of pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw increased 41 and 40 respectively while pine pulpwood ppw inventory increased 25 over this same period a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service usfs data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber in the alabama cluster catchment area increased from 60 in 2012 to 62 in 2020 suggesting that the sequestration rate of carbon also increased slightly over this period note that the increase in overall growth rate and therefore increase in the sequestration rate of carbon can be linked to gains in pine timberland and associated changes with the catchment area forest specifically growth rates decline as timber ages so the influx of new pine timberland due to the conversion of both hardwood forests and cropland has resulted in just the opposite with the average age of softwood pine growing stock inventory decreasing from an estimated 354 years of age in 2000 to 332 years of age in 2010 and to 322 years of age in 2020 total growing stock inventory decreased from 419 to 410 and to 404 years of age over these periods an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual timber removals provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2020 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood ppw the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 326 recall that a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels moreover note that the ppw gr ratio has increased in the catchment area since the aliceville mills startup in 2012 despite the associated increases in pine pulpwood demand in this catchment area pine pulpwood demand from nonbioenergy sources decreased more than 860000 metric tons from 2012 to 2020 and this decrease more than offset any increase in demand from bioenergy impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood ppw increased 25 in the catchment area from 20122020 and this increase in ppw inventory can be linked to both increases in pine timberland and harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area specifically pine timberland both planted and natural combined increased more than 185000 hectares in the catchment area from 20122020 over this same period annual harvests of ppw were 65 below maximum sustainable levels timber growth rates neutral the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber increased from 60 in 2012 to 62 in 2020 in the alabama cluster catchment area despite pine pulpwood ppw growth rate decreasing from 151 to 125 over this period however this decrease in ppw growth rate was not due to increased demand attributed to bioenergy but rather to the aging of ppw within its product group and its natural movement along the pine growth rate curve specifically usfs data indicates the average age of ppw inventory in the catchment area increased from an estimated 134 years of age in 2012 to 136 years of age in 2020 forest area neutral in the alabama cluster catchment area total forest timberland area remained nearly unchanged decreasing only marginally from 20122020 however pine timberland  the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production  increased more than 185000 hectares over this period and this increase can be linked to several factors including conversion from both hardwood and mixed pinehardwood forests as well as conversion from cropland specifically the more than 185000hectare increase in pine timberland from 20122020 coincided with a roughly 197000hectare decrease in hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland and a more than 8000hectare decrease in cropland over this period furthermore statistical analysis confirmed these inverse relationships identifying strong negative correlations between pine timberland area and both hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland area and cropland in the catchment area from 20122020 wood prices negativeneutral softwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy increased from roughly 80000 metric tons in 2012 the year alabama pelletsaliceville started up to more than 655000 metric tons in 2015 the year biomass demand reached peak levels however this roughly 575000metric ton increase in softwood biomass demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood ppw price  which averaged 2640 per ton in 2012 and 2639 per ton in 2015 ultimately the additional demand placed on this catchment area following the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville was offset by a more than 680000metric ton decrease in demand from other sources over this same period and as a result delivered ppw prices remained nearly unchanged also note that alabama pellets strategic shift to consume residuals only a transition that begun in 2018 and had been completed by 2019 resulted in a nearly 480000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand in the catchment area from 2015 to 2020 over this same period softwood pulpwood demand from other sources decreased more than 180000 metric tons in total softwood pulpwood demand from all sources decreased more than 660000 metric tons from 2015 to 2020 and this decrease in demand resulted in delivered ppw prices decreasing 5 over this period statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however the relationship between delivered ppw price and nonbiomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94 of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012 ultimately the findings provide evidence that ppw price is influenced by demand from all sources  not just from bioenergy or from pulppaper but from both markets for solid wood products positive in the alabama cluster catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products has increased an estimated 12 since 2012 and this increase in softwood lumber production has consequentially resulted in the increased production of sawmill residuals ie chips sawdust and shavings  byproducts of the sawmilling process and materials utilized by alabama pellets to produce wood pellets moreover the increased availability of sawmill residuals and lower relative cost compared to roundwood after chipping and other processing costs are considered led alabama pellets to make a strategic shift to utilize residuals only for wood pellet production beginning in 2019 so not only has alabama pellets benefited from the greater availability of this lowercost sawmill byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as alabama pellets has provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts read the full report alabama cluster catchment area analysis this is part of a series of

sustainable biomass program sbp  supply chain  forests  pinnacle renewable energy  forestry and forest management and arboriculture  biomass what is sustainable forest management 18 january 2022 sustainable bioenergy sustainable forest management is frequently defined in terms of providing a balance of social environmental and economic benefits not just for today but for the future too it might be seen as the practice of maintaining forests to ensure they remain healthy absorb more carbon than they release and can continue to be enjoyed and used by future generations to achieve this foresters apply science knowledge and standards that help ensure forests continue to play an important role in the wellbeing of people and the planet managed forests also called working forests fulfil a variety of environmental social and economic functions these range from forests managed to attract certain desired wildlife species to forests grown to provide saw timber and reoccurring revenue for landowners how are forests sustainably managed how forests are managed depends on landowner goals  managing for recreation and wildlife focusing on maximising production of wood products or both each forest requires management tailored to its owners or managers objectives there are many ways to manage forests to keep them healthy  there is no one size fits all  but keeping track of how they are doing can be tricky one alternative for monitoring forests is to use satellite imagery  one common sustainable forestry practice is thinning  which involves periodically removing smaller unhealthy or diseased trees to enable stronger ones to thrive thinning reduces competition between trees for resources like sunlight and water and it can also help promote biodiversity by creating more space for other forest flora the wood removed from forests through thinning is sometimes not highquality enough to be used in industries such as construction or furniture however the biomass industry can use it to make compressed wood pellets  a feedstock for renewable source electricity by providing a market for lowquality wood pellet production encourages landowners to carry out thinnings this practice improves the health of the forest and helps support better growth greater carbon storage and creates more valuable woodland fast facts forests cover about 30 of the worlds land surface absorbing around 16 billion tonnes of co 2 a year  42 of eu forests are covered by 3 rd party forest certification schemes through sustainable forest management annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million m 3 in 1953 to 408 million in 2015  what are the environmental benefits of sustainably managed forests through their ability to act as carbon sinks forests are an important part of meeting global climate goals like the paris agreement and the uks own target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 when managed effectively through thinning or active harvesting and replanting and regeneration forests can often sequester  or absorb and store  more carbon than forests that are left untouched increasing productivity and improving planting material harvesting trees before they reach an age when growth slows or plateaus can help prevent fire damage pests and disease so timing of final cutting is important though the vast majority of timber from such cutting will go to other markets construction furniture etc and secure higher prices from those markets being able to sell lower quality wood for biomass provides the landowner with some extra revenue sustainably managed forests also help achieve other environmental goals such as sustaining biodiversity protecting sensitive sites and providing clean air and water managed forests also have substantial water absorption capacity preventing flooding by slowing the flow of sudden downpours and helping to prevent nearby rivers and streams from overfilling wood from working forests also help tackle climate change in that highvalue wood from harvested trees can be used to make timber for the construction or furniture sectors these wood products lock up carbon for extended periods of time and the wood can be used at endof life to displace fossil fuels using wood also means materials such as concrete bricks or steel are not used and these materials have a large carbon footprint compared to wood what are the socioeconomic benefits of sustainably managed forests there are also social and economic benefits to managing forests sustainably managed working forests make vital contributions both to people and to the planet the commercial use of wood in industries like furniture and construction drives revenue for landowners this encourages landowners to continue to replant forests and manage them in a sustainable way that continues to deliver returns healthy forests can also improve living standards for local communities for jobs and helping to address unemployment in rural regions managed forests can also improve access for recreation on a larger scale sustainable forestry can offer a valuable export for regions and nations and foster trade between countries go deeper how a german miner laid the foundation for sustainable working forests more than 300years ago sustainably managed forests can act as substantial and effective tools for carbon sequestration  more countries around the world are looking to sustainable forest management  how foresters can manage forests for lifelong solid wood products and optimise the carbon benefits  tags biomass energy  sustainability  sustainable
