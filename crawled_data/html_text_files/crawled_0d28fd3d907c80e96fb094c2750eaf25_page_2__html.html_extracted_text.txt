Drax joins World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition
29 August 2023
Press releases

Drax has today announced its membership to the First Movers Coalition (FMC), playing its part in the development of the nascent carbon dioxide removals (CDR) market and working toward becoming a global leader in the potentially trillion-dollar sector.
The FMC, launched at COP26 by U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, is a coalition of companies who use their collective purchasing power to create early markets for innovative clean technologies. Led by the World Economic Forum and the U.S. Department of State, the FMC is currently focused on addressing eight hard to abate industries, which are currently responsible for 30 percent of global emissions such as shipping and aviation.
Drax will join the Carbon Dioxide Removals group, comprised of businesses with commitments to purchase durable and scalable carbon removals from solutions such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), a vital new technology, in which Drax is a pioneer.
Carbon removals are used by organisations to balance their hard-to-abate carbon emissions, achieve a net zero and, in some cases, a carbon negative status. Longer lasting and lower risk carbon credits, such as the types generated by carbon removals technologies, are increasing in demand as more organisations look to hit their decarbonisation targets.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said
“The commitments to carbon dioxide removals we are seeing in the market now are essential to accelerating the deployment of climate saving technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) which we will need to meet our climate goals.”
“We welcome the opportunity to join the World Economic Forum in their efforts developing early markets for innovative technologies like BECCS.”
“Through BECCS, Drax aims to be a global leader in high-integrity carbon removals and as part of that ambition we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate leadership and investment in the sector.”
Nancy Gillis, Programme Head of the First Movers Coalition at the World Economic Forum said,
“We are thrilled to welcome Drax to the First Movers Coalition and look forward to working alongside the company to drive the acceleration of the global carbon removals market.”
“The First Movers Coalition believes that reducing emissions to net-zero by 2050 is possible if the right technologies are brought to commercial scale within the next decade, and we need companies like Drax to champion this mission to enact the change we need.”
With the right government engagement, Drax plans to invest billions over the coming years in global carbon removals and renewable energy projects, with the aim of capturing 14Mt a year of carbon removals by 2030 globally and to be a global leader in carbon removal projects.

Editor’s Notes:
Drax is an international, growing, sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security, and is accelerating its progress in the development of global BECCS projects.
Nearly all pathways to limit global warming to 1.5C require carbon removal technologies, such as BECCS.
The IPCC believes that globally up to 9.5 billion tonnes of CDRs via BECCS will be required per year by 2050.
Carbon dioxide removals can be used by organisations to balance their hard-to-abate carbon emissions, achieve a net zero and, in some cases, a carbon negative status.
Longer lasting and lower risk carbon credits, such as the types generated by carbon removals technologies, are increasing in demand as more organisations look to hit their decarbonisation targets.

Scottish Energy Minister calls on UK Government to support new pumped storage hydro plants
16 August 2023
Press releases

Mr Gray gave his backing to the industry while visiting Drax’s iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station near Oban in Argyll, where the renewable energy giant is progressing plans to build a new £500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at the site. Expanding the UK’s pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid, enhancing the nation’s energy security while tackling climate change.
Pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it.
Despite the critical need for them, no new plants have been commissioned in the UK since 1984, with existing support schemes for other technologies unsuitable for the unique needs of these large-scale infrastructure projects. A
report
by KPMG found that a cap and floor mechanism, like the regime used to incentivise investment in cross-border interconnectors, could overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said:
“To achieve a safe and secure net zero power grid, we need to have a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants to balance our grid.
“As the UK increasingly relies on intermittent renewables to keep our lights on, there is a growing need for flexible power sources to plug the gap when the wind doesn’t blow, or the sun doesn’t shine. With its reversible turbines, Cruachan can also store excess power from Scotland’s wind turbines when they are generating more renewable electricity than we need, helping to stop valuable green power from going to waste.
“With the right support from the UK Government, Drax will invest £500m to more than double Cruachan’s generating capacity and support almost 1,000 jobs across the supply chain during construction.”
Scottish Government Energy Secretary Neil Gray MSP said:
“Scotland is a global leader in the production of renewable energy, which will play an increasingly important role in the transition to a net zero electricity system by 2045.
“However, pumped hydro storage, an important low carbon technology, is currently ineligible for UK Government support. UK Government inaction on this issue represents a significant obstacle to progress and risks failing to secure economic benefits, such as creating thousands of good quality, green jobs.”
Earlier this year, a
report
commissioned by the influential trade body Scottish Renewables found that a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants in Scotland could create almost 15,000 jobs across the UK, with Drax’s Cruachan expansion generating almost half a billion pounds for the UK economy.
Drax acquired Cruachan alongside the Galloway and Lanark hydro schemes in 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, renewable power generation.

Editor’s Notes:
Drax
applied for development consent
from the Scottish Government under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 in May 2022.
The plans
received consent
through the Section 36 process in July 2023.
The UK Government has
pledged
to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in large-scale, long-duration storage projects by 2024.
A report by
KPMG
for Drax found that a Cap & Floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently.
No investment decision has yet been taken by Drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other considerations.

These groups make a tangible difference to people’s lives and help us make a positive impact on people, nature and the climate in our communities.”
In the previous quarter, Drax donated to groups including PlayStillingfleet, who look after the Stillingfleet playground, for new play equipment, and Hensall Village Hall, to help fund a new boiler. Both sites are in the vicinity of North Yorkshire’s Drax Power Station.
Ross Powell, Chair at PlayStillingfleet Community Group, said:
“The funding has allowed us to successfully deliver the final phase of our playground project. The playground has quickly become a focal point for children and parents to come together and build the next generation of friendships in the village.”
David Hardaker, Treasurer at Hensall Village Hall, said:
“The new boiler has been installed thanks to the generosity of the Drax Community Fund plus local support via a concert which raised £490.
“Without Drax’s support the outcome would have been so much different. We are now looking forward to a warm space in the winter that will ensure that all our groups continue and hopefully expand. Until Drax intervened so generously we were looking at closure, without a doubt.”
Drax’s Community Fund provides donations of £500-£2,000 for community-led projects. In addition, the Drax Foundation was launched in March this year to award larger grants of up to £50,000 for established non-profit organisations. In addition to the Drax Community Fund, we also provide larger grants of up to £50,000 through the Drax Foundation.

Drax boosts education and skills with work experience placements
14 August 2023
Press releases

The programme gives students the opportunity to work alongside highly trained staff, observe practical tasks and ask questions to improve understanding and help them decide if a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) is right for them. Students who took part could choose from a variety of business areas including engineering, IT, finance, and facilities.
Dylan Baines
, who is in Year 10 at school, spent a week at Drax Power Station working with colleagues in the trading department. Dylan was already familiar with Drax having built a car with the Drax Green team in Primary School that won a race in Hull for his school and for Drax.
He said: “I chose to do my work experience at Drax because I was recommended it and I know that it is a very successful company where the staff are very helpful and supportive.”
“I’m very interested in engineering and fixing machines and getting my hands dirty. I know that Drax has a very good engineering department, and they are always looking for new people and always trying to help people as much as they can.”
Polly Whyley
chose to work in the logistics team, learning all about the company’s supply chain and how Drax is able to generate enough power for millions of homes and businesses.
She said: “I chose to do my work experience at Drax because it seemed like a very interesting place to work- I thought it was the kind of place that I may not ever get the opportunity to visit again and that I should take the chance to see what it was like.”
“I am planning to study Physics at university and coming to Drax has made me consider a career in the energy sector. I had not previously known the variety of STEM roles required in the area.”
Bobby Rodger
, spent a week shadowing engineers in the maintenance team. Bobby, whose dad Mike works in Operations at Drax Power Station, said:
“I have really enjoyed my time at Drax. I feel it has helped me grow in confidence from meeting all the new people and have learned a lot about teamwork and safety. It has really inspired me to push on at school and try to achieve the grades I need to achieve.
“I feel as though I have made friends at Drax and really felt welcomed straight away and felt the team had planned in advance for my arrival with many things to do and see. The team were lovely and involved me in everything all week.”
Oliver McNiff,
who also did a week’s work experience with the logistics team, said:
“I personally chose Drax Power Station for my work experience because I am trying to take engineering courses when I am older and hopefully have a career in the design engineering front. I live near drax so I knew a lot about what the company did and thought, There was no better place for engineering than Drax.”
“I found the work experience very informative and fun. My week was very engineering based and we went everywhere from looking at how train companies modify their wagons to eliminate any potential faults to viewing the massive fleets and logistics side of things.”
Prior to attending the in-person work experience, all students completed an induction day, which introduced them to career opportunities at Drax and gave them the opportunity to improve their employability skills, through activities such as CV coaching and interview practice. They were also able to meet and network with potential managers and senior leaders.
Bruce Heppenstall
, Plant Director, said:
“We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire young people from all backgrounds to study STEM subjects. It’s important that the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours in new fields like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, also known as BECCS, as we continue to decarbonise.
“We’re pleased to be able to offer in-person work placements at our sites and hope that this will give students a valuable insight into the world of work and spark an interest in STEM subjects.”
Drax is welcoming 45 work experience students across its sites in the UK, including Cruachan Power Station in Scotland. At the end of the week, each student will be presented with a certificate of achievement and a £100 Amazon voucher to spend on books and educational resources.
Drax runs a variety of initiatives to support STEM education and skills including offering
power station tours
and running
interactive workshops
for students. This includes initiatives supported by the Drax Foundation, launched earlier this year, which funds initiatives that support STEM, as well as those that improve green spaces and enhance biodiversity within local communities.

Drax Power Station shines a white rose across Yorkshire
1 August 2023
Press releases

The White Rose of York will appear on one of Drax Power Station’s 350ft tall cooling towers on Tuesday August 1 as the renewable energy leader joins with other businesses and community groups across the county to mark the annual event.
Drax Power Station is the UK’s single-largest renewable power generator, producing enough renewable electricity for around four million UK homes. Recently published
research
by Oxford Economics found the power station contributed £358m to the economy of Yorkshire and the Humber, with 2,580 jobs supported by the plant.
Drax now aims to deepen its commitment to the county in the years ahead through delivering the world’s biggest carbon capture in power project using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (
BECCS
) technology. The development of BECCS at the Selby plant could see up to 10,000 jobs supported at the project’s peak and will make a major contribution to the fight against climate change.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Power Station Plant Director said:
“We’re proud to have been generating power for Yorkshire’s homes and businesses for almost half a century, so we wanted to do something special to celebrate Yorkshire Day.
“We all know this county has a rich industrial heritage, but at Drax we believe Yorkshire has a bright future too. That’s why we are progressing plans to build the world’s biggest carbon capture in power project at our plant near Selby, enabling the county to become a global leader in the vital green energy technology BECCS.
“By delivering this critical carbon removal technology, Drax will strengthen UK energy security, whilst creating thousands of jobs and exciting global export opportunities.”
Once operational, Drax’s two BECCS units combined will capture around 8 million tonnes of CO
2
per year, making it the largest carbon capture and storage project in power in the world.
The White Rose will be projected onto the 350ft tall cooling tower at Drax Power Station from 9:00pm on Tuesday 1
st
August.

Notes to editors:
Electricity has been generated at Drax since 1974 when it was developed by the Central Electricity Generating Board, in an area of Yorkshire known as Megawatt Valley due to a fleet of coal-fired power stations built there in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.
Drax was the biggest and one of the most advanced and efficient coal-fired power stations ever built in the UK. Nearly five decades on, the power station is the largest dispatchable renewable power station in the UK through its pioneering decarbonisation project to use biomass instead of coal. In March this year, almost 50 years of coal generation ended at Drax Power Station in a landmark moment for the plant, Yorkshire and the whole of the UK.
Giving back to Yorkshire and the Humber
The Drax Foundation was established in 2023 to provide grant funding for non-profit organisations and social enterprises that deliver lasting socio-economic impact in the heart of our communities. The Foundation has
recently awarded
almost £90,000 to:
NYBEP
(North Yorkshire Business and Education Partnership) who work with schools and businesses to develop STEM programmes
Don Catchment Rivers Trust
which offers Community-led conservation and nature-based STEM education for children
Toranj Tuition
, a Hull-based organisation established to stimulate social mobility and to facilitate equal opportunities for adults and children through our educational programmes.
