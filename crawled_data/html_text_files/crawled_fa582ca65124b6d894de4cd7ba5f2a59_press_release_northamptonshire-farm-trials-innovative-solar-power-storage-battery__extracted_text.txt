climate policy forests and biomass transport contact us northamptonshire farm trials innovative solar power with storage battery a daventry farm has become one of the first businesses in the uk to trial an innovative battery system which would enable electricity from solar panels to be stored and then sold back to the national grid when it is in demand potentially increasing returns for greener companies 11 november 2018 the low carbon pilot project will see local farmer sue harrison working in partnership with power firm opus energy to test the new technology which has just been installed at familyrun home farm in braunston northamptonshire solar panels on the cattle shed at the farm which produces aberdeen angus beef as well as lamb currently provide power to the farmhouse and the marquee from which they run their successful wedding business which is already fully booked until 2020 as the 50 kw panels generate more power than is consumed by the farm the extra electricity is exported to the national grid and sue and her family are paid for it by opus energy through a power purchase agreement ppa  known as  prosuming  experts at opus energy say the new battery technology being trialled at home farm if successful could open up revenue streams for businesses as it would allow excess electricity to be stored and then sold back to the grid when it is needed the most therefore commanding a higher price jonathan kini chief executive of drax retail which provides power to smaller businesses through opus energy as well as to larger companies through haven power said the pilot is one of a number of innovative low carbon schemes being looked at by the energy supplier we know customers and businesses are keen to embrace sustainability wherever they can and were keen to help jonathan commented its early days for this project well need to see how it develops now its installed at home farm but if its successful this could provide opportunities for more and more businesses in the future to take control generate their own energy and choose when they sell it to the grid to provide another revenue stream the electricity industry is changing quickly and increasing digitalisation will help customers save money as they learn to use less help us move to greener lowercarbon energy sources and also see the rise of prosumers like sue and her family were really grateful to the home farm team for agreeing to take part in this trial sue whose family have been farming in braunston for over 60 years and launched the wedding business in 2015 said im really proud of the way our business has developed but im also keen to leave my children and even grandchildren a business which is genuinely sustainable weve been on a ppa since 2012 but if this means we get more control of when we sell the energy we produce and dont need and make a little more money for the business then thats got to be worth doing more and more wedding customers are looking for sustainable greener venues and it would be great to able to showcase our credentials through innovations like this to future customers if successful batteries similar to the one installed at home farm for the trial could be available to other customers ends media contact mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email protected t 01484 968238 m 07969 080272 about drax drax group plc plays a vital role
