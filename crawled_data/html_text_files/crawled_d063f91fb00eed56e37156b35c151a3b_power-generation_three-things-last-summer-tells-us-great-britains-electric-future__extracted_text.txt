power station three things last summer tells us about great britains electric future what can july to september 2018 tell us about what to expect on the power system going forward 7 november 2018 power generation great britains electricity system has had its robustness tested at both ends of the thermometer in 2018 first the onceinadecade low temperatures of the  beast from the east saw electricity demand reach its highest peak in three years on 1 march as the country turned on electric heaters and extra lighting following fast on its heels was an unusually hot dry and still summer that pushed demand up by the equivalent of adding a second scotland to the system  and required solar generation to make up for a wind drought and all of this happened in the first half of the year so far the second half of the year has seen fewer instances of freak weather which has meant fewer peaks in the power system while uneventful in this sense the last quarter of great britains power does go some way towards showing us what we might expect from the system in the future the findings come from electric insights  an independent report written by researchers at imperial college london and commissioned by drax that analyses the countrys power and hints at what we might expect in the future breaking renewable records will get boring quarter after quarter great britain breaks new renewable records and q3 2018 was no exception the threemonth period from july through september saw total capacity of renewable sources exceed fossil fuels for the first time great britain now has 406 gigawatts gw of gas coal diesel and oilfired power generation capacity compared to 419 gw of capacity from wind solar biomass hydro and waste sources to put this into perspective at the start of the decade fossil fuel capacity was seven times that of renewables since 2010 renewables have grown sixfold wind passed 20 gw of installed capacity in september and is now the countrys largest renewable source solar has slowed in growth but remains the second biggest renewable with 13 gw of capacity biomass is now the third largest source of renewable electricity thanks to the coaltobiomass conversions of lynemouth power station and draxs unit 4  which together added 1 gw more renewable electricity to the system along with these conversions a quarter of the countrys coal capacity retired in the last year leaving just six generators in operation while this shift to renewables is helping decarbonise great britains power system the increasing intermittency that comes with it means balancing the grid is becoming more complicated read the full article coauthored by luke clark at renewableuk renewables leapfrog fossil capacity as balancing the network becomes more complex it could grow more expensive the daily cost of running the transmission system  which manages the flow of electricity from generators to consumers  has doubled over the last four years this growth has been steady since 2010 but q3 2018 saw the cost reach onesixth higher than the previous record in q3 2017 over this quarter balancing the system on average cost 38 million per day with three days seeing costs exceed 10 million in turn adding 6 to the overall wholesale price of electricity part of the reason for the increased costs is that need for balancing services such as voltage control reserve power and frequency response spike when there are high levels of intermittent renewables such as wind and solar on the system as this type of generation cant be perfectly calculated it is important for national grid to ensure there are flexible reserve sources running to plug gaps and help move electricity around the grid  both of which incur balancing costs for example in september balancing costs spiked several times as a result of increases in wind power the rising price highlights that for the grid to function its not just a matter of generating enough electricity to meet demand where and when it is generated is as important to maintain its stability and with everincreasing levels of intermittent renewables the need for stabilising services will grow read the full article the cost of staying in balance the cost of generating electricity may rise which will have knock on effects its not just balancing costs however that are driving up the cost of electricity dayahead market prices have risen by 50 over the last year  from an average of 42mwh in q3 2017 to 60mwh last quarter this was not the result of spikes caused by events such as the beast from the east or the summers world cup final but by a gradual creeping up of prices caused by a combination of increasing gas prices and carbon emissions costs as well as a weaker pound in the wake of ongoing brexit negotiations gas power stations are six times more influential on power price than any other generation technology but with global gas prices rising 50 the countrys primary source of flexible generation is becoming costlier the knock on effect of this 10year high gas price was not only an impact on consumers pockets but also a resurgence in coal which became cheaper than gas and led to a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation for a period during the quarter  adding to this the european emissions trading scheme ets increased the price of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by a factor of four over the past 12 months pushing up the cost of wholesale electricity even further the international nature of the electricity system also makes prices vulnerable to currency fluctuations and a weakening pound made the impact greater the currency devaluations following the eu referendum are continuing to contribute to this and ofgem found it caused an 18 increase in electricity prices  this isnt the referendums only effect if the uk leaves the eu next year under a nodeal scenario the country would also exit the ets removing a component of the current total carbon price there are plans to replace this with a new tax adding to the existing uk carbon price support cps but this would only come into effect from april 2019 leaving q1 with just the cps  effectively making it cheaper to emit carbon during that threemonth period which in turn adds a risk of more carbonintensive sources becoming more economically viable than renewable sources while there is little great britain can do to influence international fuel prices it can alter domestic policies to influence the price for consumers making heavily emitting fuels economically prohibitive and incentivising more lower carbon and renewable sources onto the system can reduce dependency on imported fuels and cut carbon costs read the full article wholesale power prices hit a 10year high explore the quarters data in detail by
