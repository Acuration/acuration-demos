quarter another step forward in britains decarbonisation 11 may 2017 power generation its been another recordbreaking quarter for britains power system during the first three months of 2017 biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output and while this is all worth celebrating it shouldnt come as a surprise  the last few years have seen britains power system take several significant steps toward decarbonisation and this year is no different electric insights the quarterly report on britains power system by dr iain staffell from imperial college london commissioned by drax via imperial consultants documents the new gains and confirms the trend renewables are fast becoming the new norm and in 2017 they continued their growth the renewable record breakers over this quarter biomass electricity generation hit a record production figure of 44 twh which means that biomass generators ran at 95 of full capacity  higher than any other technology has achieved over the last decade hydro went 4 better than its previous energy production best by generating 16 twh while britains wind farms produced 113 twh 10 higher than the previous record set in 2015 this was helped in part by several new farms being built which increased installed capacity by 5 over last year but it was also indebted to the mild windy weather wind farms produced more electricity than coal 57 days out of 90 during the first three months of 2017 solar hit a new record peak output at the end of march when it generated 767 gw  enough to power a fifth of the country in fact during the last weekend of march for the first time ever the countrys demand for electricity from the national grid was lower during an afternoon than during the night this was because solar panels which only generate power when the sun is up tend to sit outside of the national high voltage transmission grid understanding how this happened is to understand how solar energy is changing our national power system a reverse of the trend electricity demand on the national grid  think of it as the power systems motorways  is typically higher during the day and early evening when people are most active using lights and gadgets than overnight however on the last weekend in march 2017 the opposite was true because of how much solar energy was generated solar panels and some smaller onshore windfarms are invisible  they dont feed into the national grid instead these sources either feed into the regional electricity distribution networks  the power systems a and b roads  or as many of them are on peoples roofs and used in their own homes or business premises it never gets down their driveway this can mean when solar panels are generating a lot of electricity there is a lower demand for power from the grid making it appear that less of the country is using electricity than it actually is this was the case during the last weekend of march when solar generated enough power to satisfy a large part of britains demand and while this is another positive step towards a lower carbon energy mix it is about to change the way our power system works particularly when it comes to the remaining coal power stations what the power system needs to provide today and in the future is flexibility  to ramp up and down to accommodate for the shifting demand based on supply of intermittent  weather dependent  renewables thermal power stations such as gas coal and biomass can meet much of this demand but even more rapid response from technologies such as the open cycle gas turbines that drax is developing and batteries could fulfil these needs quicker todays dirty is yesterdays clean the record breaking and increased renewable generation of the period from january to march 2017 would mean nothing if it wasnt matched by a decrease in emissions during the first three months of 2017 emissions dropped 10 lower than the same period in 2016 and a massive 33 lower than 2015 coal output alone fell 30 this quarter compared to q1 2016 to put the scale of this progress into context we need only look at the quarters dirtiest hour  the hour in which carbon intensity from electricity generation is at its highest between january and march it peaked on a calm and cold january evening with 424 grams of co 2 released per kwh gkwh the average for generation between 2009 and 2013 was 471 gkwh in short this quarters dirtiest hour was cleaner than the average figure just four years ago  yesterdays average is todays extremity if we want to continue to break records and further progress towards a fully decarbonised power system this needs to be a consistent aim making the averages of today tomorrows extremes top line stats highest energy production ever wind  113 twh biomass  44 twh hydro  16 twh record peak output solar  767 gw enough to power 15 of the country yesterdays average is todays extremity average carbon emissions per kwh
