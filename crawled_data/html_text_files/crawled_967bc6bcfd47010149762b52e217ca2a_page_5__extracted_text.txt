decarbonisation could hydrogen power stations offer flexible electricity for a net zero future 26 august 2020 power generation were familiar with using natural gas every day in heating homes powering boilers and igniting stove tops but this same natural gas  predominantly methane  is also one of the most important sources of electricity to the uk in 2019 gas generation accounted for 39 of great britains electricity mix  but that could soon be changing hydrogen the super simple super light element can be a zerocarbon emissions source of fuel while were used to seeing it in everyday in water h 2 o as a gas it has been tested as an alternative to methane in homes and as a fuel for vehicles  could it also replace natural gas in power stations and help keep the lights on the need for a new gas hydrogen fuel station natural gas has been the largest single source of electricity in great britain since around 2000 aside from the period 2012 14 when coal made a resurgence due to high gas prices the dominance of gas over coal is in part thanks to the abundant supply of it in the north sea along with carbon pricing  domestic supply makes gas much cheaper than coal and much cleaner emitting as much as 60 less co 2 than the solid fossil fuel added to this is the ability of gas power stations to start up change their output and shut down very quickly to meet sudden shifts in electricity demand this flexibility is helpful to support the growth of weatherdependant renewable sources of power such as wind or solar the stability gas brings has helped the country decarbonise its power supply rapidly hydrogen on the other hand can be an even cleaner fuel as it only releases water vapour and nitrous oxide when combusted in large gas turbines this means it could offer a low or zerocarbon flexible alternative to natural gas that makes use of great britains existing gas infrastructure but its not as simple as just switching fuels switching gases some thermal power stations work by combusting a fuel such as biomass or coal in a boiler to generate intense heat that turns water into highpressure steam which then spins a turbine gas turbines however are different engineer works on a turbine at drax power station instead of heating water into steam a simple gas turbine blasts a mix of gas plus air from the surrounding atmosphere at high pressure into a combustion chamber where a chemical reaction takes place  oxygen from the air continuously feeding a gaspowered flame the highpressure and hot gasses then spin a turbine the reaction that takes place inside the combustion chamber is dependent on the chemical mix that enters it natural gas turbines have been tailored and optimised for their working conditions explains richard armstrong drax lead engineer hydrogen is a gas that burns in the same way as natural gas but it burns at different temperatures at different speeds and it requires different ratios of oxygen to get the most efficient combustion switching a power station from natural gas to hydrogen would take significant testing and refining to optimise every aspect of the process and ensure everything is safe this would no doubt continue over years subtly developing the engines over time to improve efficiency in a similar way to how natural gas combustion has evolved but its certainly possible what may be trickier though is providing the supply of hydrogen necessary to power and balance the countrys electricity system  making hydrogen hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but its very rare to find it on its own because its so atomically simple its highly reactive and almost always found naturally bonded to other elements water is the prime example its made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom making it h 2 o hydrogens tendency to bond with everything means a pure stream of it as would be needed in a power station has to be produced rather than extracted from underground like natural gas hydrogen as a gas at standard temperature and pressure is known by the symbol h 2  a power station would also need a lot more hydrogen than natural gas by volume it would take three times as much hydrogen to produce the same amount of energy as would be needed with natural gas however because it is so light the hydrogen would still have a lower mass a very large supply of hydrogen would be needed which doesnt exist in the uk at the moment says rachel grima research  innovation engineer at drax so at the same time as converting a power plant to hydrogen youd need to build a facility to produce it alongside it one of the most established ways to produce hydrogen is through a process known as steam methane reforming this applies high temperatures and pressure to natural gas to break down the methane which makes up the majority of natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide co 2  the obvious problem with the process is it still emits co 2  meaning carbon capture and storage ccs systems are needed if it is to be carbon neutral source zero carbon humber its almost like capturing the co 2 from natural gas before its combusted rather than postcombustion explains grima one of the advantages of this is that the co 2 is at a much higher concentration which makes it much easier to capture than in flue gas when it is diluted with a lot of nitrogen using natural gas in the process produces whats known as grey hydrogen adding carbon capture to make the process carbon neutral is known as blue hydrogen  but there are ways to make it with renewable energy sources too electrolysis is already an established technology where an electrical current is used to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen this green hydrogen cuts out the co 2 emissions that come from using natural gas however like charging an electric vehicle the process is only carbonneutral if the electricity powering it comes from zero carbon sources such as nuclear wind and solar its also possible to produce hydrogen from biomass by putting biomass under high temperatures and adding a limited amount of oxygen to prevent the biomass combusting the biomass can be gasified meaning it is turned into a mix of hydrogen and co 2  by using a sustainable biomass supply chain where forests absorb the equivalent of the co 2 emitted but where some fossil fuels are used within the supply chain the process becomes low carbon carbon capture use and storage ccus incubation area drax power station ccs can then be added to make it carbon negative overall meaning more co 2 is captured and stored at forest level and in belowground carbon storage than is emitted throughout its lifecycle this form of green hydrogen is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen or negative emissions hydrogen there are plenty of options for making hydrogen but doing it at the scale needed for power generation and ensuring its an affordable fuel is the real challenge then there is the issue of transporting and working with hydrogen the difficulty is less in converting the uks gas power stations and turbines themselves thats a hurdle but most turbine manufacturers already in the process of developing solutions for this says armstrong the challenge is establishing a stable and consistent supply of hydrogen and the transmission network to get it to site working with the lightest known element today hydrogen is mainly transported by truck as either a gas or cooled down to minus253 degrees celsius at which point it becomes a liquid lh 2  however there is plenty of infrastructure already in place around the uk that could make transporting hydrogen significantly more efficient the uk has a very advanced and comprehensive gas grid a conversion to hydrogen would be more economic if you could repurpose the existing gas infrastructure says hannah steedman innovation engineer at drax the most feasible way to feed a power station is through pipelines and a lot of work is underway to determine if the current natural gas network could be used for hydrogen hydrogen is different to natural gas in that it is a very small and highly reactive molecule therefore it needs to be treated differently for example parts of the existing gas network are made of steel a metal which hydrogen reacts with causing whats known as hydrogen embrittlement which can lead to cracks and failures that could potentially allow gas to escape there are also factors around safety and efficiency to consider like natural gas hydrogen is also odourless meaning it would need to have an odourant added to it experimentation is underway to find out if mercaptan the odourant added to natural gas to give it a sulphuric smell is also compatible with hydrogen but for all the challenges that might come with switching to hydrogen there are huge advantages the uks gas network  both power generation and domestic  must move away from fossil fuels if it is to stop emitting co 2 into the atmosphere and for the country to reach net zero by 2050 while the process will not be as simple as switching gases it creates an opportunity to upgrade the uks gas infrastructure  for power in homes and even as a vehicle fuel  source zero carbon humber it wont happen overnight but hydrogen is a proven energy fuel source while it may take time to ramp up production to a scale which can meet demand at a reasonable cost transitioning to hydrogen is a chance to futureproof the gas systems that contributes so heavily to the uks stable power system  tags technology  gas  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon

goals laid out in the paris agreement there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide co 2  currently in the atmosphere and the co 2 that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise the process of greenhouse gas removal ggr or co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere is possible through negative emissions  where more co 2 is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere negative emissions can be achieved through a range of naturebased solutions or through manmade technologies designed to remove co 2 at scale what naturebased solutions exist to remove co 2 from the atmosphere one millenniaold way of achieving negative emissions is forests  trees absorb carbon when they grow either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen or storing it over their lifetime this makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere planting new forests and regenerating forests has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result however this can also go beyond forests on land vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store co 2  and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much carbon as forests on land  an approach to negative emissions called blue carbon did you know bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world  its thick forests absorb three times the amount of co 2 the small country emits what manmade technologies can deliver negative emissions many scientists and experts agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this approach uses biomass  sourced from sustainably managed forests  to generate electricity as the forests used to create biomass absorb co 2 while growing the co 2 released when it is used as fuel is already accounted for  making the whole process low carbon by then capturing and storing any co 2 emitted often in safe underground deposits the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative  as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added direct air carbon capture and storage daccs is an alternative technological solution in which co 2 is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used while this could hold huge potential the technology is currently in its infancy and requires substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice the process of removing co 2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions because more co 2 is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it how much negative emissions are needed according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  negative emissions technologies could be required to capture 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050 negative emissions fast facts humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere the crust of the earth to the biosphere where we live at 100 times the rate of the natural carbon cycle there is enough sustainable biomass

carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a largescale source  for example a power station or factory  and then permanently storing them carbon capture usage and storage ccus is where captured carbon dioxide co 2  may be used rather than stored in other industrial processes or even in the manufacture of consumer products  how is carbon captured carbon can be captured either precombustion  where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used or postcombustion  where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned precombustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide under heat pressure the separated co 2 is captured and transported to be stored or used postcombustion carbon capture uses the addition of other materials such as solvents to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned the isolated carbon is then transported normally via pipeline to be stored permanently  usually deep underground  or used for other purposes carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that co 2 is not released into the atmosphere what can the carbon be used for once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways for example material including carbon nanofibres and bioplastics can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles while several startups are developing methods of turning captured co 2 into animal feed captured carbon can even assist in the largescale production of hydrogen  which could be used as a carbonneutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation where can carbon be stored carbon can be stored in geological reserves  commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs saline aquifers or unmineable coal beds the process of storage is referred to as sequestration the underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through mineral storage  where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage according to the global ccs institute  over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the usa norway and brazil what are the benefits of carbon storage co 2 is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in our atmosphere and therefore contributes to global warming by capturing and storing carbon it is being taken out of the atmosphere which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change carbon capture fast facts ccus is an affordable way to lower co 2 emissions  fighting climate change

refers to the change in weather patterns and global temperature of the earth over long periods of time in a modern context climate change describes the rise of global temperatures that has been occurring since the industrial revolution in the 1800s what causes climate change while there have been natural fluctuations in the earths climate over previous millennia scientists have found that currentday temperatures are rising quicker than ever due to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gasses being released into the atmosphere an excess of co 2 in the atmosphere accentuates something called the greenhouse effect  as co 2 traps heat in the earths atmosphere it warms the planet and causes a rise in average global temperature international efforts such as the paris climate accords are dedicated to ensuring temperatures do not rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels which could lead to catastrophic conditions on the planet  in the modern context climate change describes the rise of global temperatures occurring since the industrial revolution in the 1800s how do humans contribute to climate change industries such as transport agriculture energy and manufacturing have traditionally relied on the use of coal oil and other fossil fuels these fuels when combusted or used emit large amounts of co 2 into the atmosphere further advancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to climate change human reliance and consumption of these products mean today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  why are rising temperatures harmful to the planet our planet has a history of experiencing periods of extreme weather conditions  for example the last ice age  which finished 12000 years ago however the rapid rise in temperatures seen today is harmful because a hotter planet completely affects our natural environment  a steep rise in global temperature can melt ice sheets and cause higher sea levels which can in turn contribute to more extreme storms and even threaten entire islands and coastal communities  as the planet warms extreme weather events such as bushfires could become more common which can destroy homes impact agriculture and degrade air quality while entire ecosystems habitats and animal and insect species could also be threatened by climate change  what can be done to mitigate the effects of climate change reducing co 2 emissions is a key way of slowing down the pace of climate change to do so industries across the global economy must decarbonise to become less dependent on fossil fuels such as coal and petrol and adopt new lower carbon energy sources decarbonisation will rely on a number of factors including a technological response that sees the development and implementation of carbon neutral and carbon negative ways of creating heat electricity and fuels including the use of innovations such as carbon capture and storage ccs there is also a need for a policy and governmental response that promotes investment in new cleaner technologies and disincentivises dirtier industries through mechanisms like the carbon tax  countries and economies will need

sustainability what is decarbonisation carbon capture what is decarbonisation decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide co 2  output of a countrys economy this is usually done by decreasing the amount of co 2 emitted across the active industries within that economy why is decarbonisation important currently a wide range of sectors  industrial residential and transport  run largely on fossil fuels  which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal oil or gas the co 2 emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas trapping in heat and contributing to global warming by using alternative sources of energy industries can reduce the amount of co 2 emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change why target carbon dioxide there are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming however co 2 is the most prevalent as of 2018 carbon levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  the paris agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures dont rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial level with 195 current signatories  economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon with the uk leading the g20 nations in decarbonising its economy in the 21 st century how is decarbonisation carried out there are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power such as wind turbines solar panels and coalto biomass upgrades  meaning that homes and businesses dont have to rely on fossil fuels other innovations such as using batteries and allowing homes to generate and share their own power can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation as the electricity itself is made cleaner it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process other approaches such as reforestation or carbon capture and storage  help to pull existing carbon from the air to neutralise carbon output  or in some cases help to make electricity generation  and even entire nations  carbon negative alternative power options means that homes and businesses dont have to rely on traditional carbon fuels what is the future of decarbonisation for decarbonisation to be more widely

more forests and better manage them 22 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy there is an ongoing debate about forests contribution to fighting the climate crisis forests can act as substantial and effective tools for carbon sequestration during a high growth phase they can also function as significant and extensive carbon storage areas during maturity and throughout multiple stages of the age class cycle if managed effectively at a landscape level or they can be emitters of carbon if overharvested subject to fire storm pest or disease damage different age class forest stands in louisiana in a natural state forests will go through each of these life phases rapid early growth maturity and senescence damage decay and destruction through natural causes then they begin the cycle again absorbing and then emitting carbon dioxide co 2  in a continual succession recently loud voices have argued against forest management per se  against harvesting for wood products in particular suggesting that this reduces both forest carbon stocks and sequestration capacity pine cut in into wood for different wood products markets in louisiana big thick straight higher value sections go to sawmills and smaller and misshapen lowgrade wood not suitable for timber production is sold to pulp paper or wood pellet mills many foresters consider that this is just not correct in fact the opposite is true research and evidence clearly support the foresters view active forest management when carried out appropriately actually increases the amount of carbon sequestered  ensures that carbon is stored in solid wood products and provides substantial savings of fossil fuels by displacing other high carbon materials eg concrete steel brick plastic and coal oliver et al2014 1 compared the impact of forest harvesting and the use of wood products to substitute other highcarbon materials concluding that  more co 2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products wood energy and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages this research demonstrated that an increase in the use of structural timber to displace concrete and steel could lead to substantial emissions savings compared to unharvested forest the use of wood for energy is an essential component of this displacement process although it is important to use appropriate feedstocks  burning wood that could be used for structural timber will not lead to a positive climate impact the message here is to manage working forests for optimum sawlog production for longlife solid wood products and utilise the byproducts for energy where this is the most viable market this provides the best allround climate benefit what happens when you close the gate closing the forest gate and stopping all harvesting and management is one option being championed by some climate change campaigners there is certainly a vital role for the preservation and protection of forests globally primary and virgin forests intact landscapes high biodiversity and high conservation value areas all need to be protected that doesnt necessarily mean that there is no forest management it should mean careful and appropriate management to maintain and ensure the future of the resource in these cases management is with an objective to reduce the risk of fire pests and disease rather than for timber production globally we need better governance understanding and implementation of best practice to achieve this forest certification and timber tracing systems are a good start this can equally apply to the many hundreds of millions of hectares of working forest that do not fall into the protection categories forests that have been managed for many hundreds of years for timber production and other purposes harvesting in these forests can be more active but governance controls and the development of best practice are required better management not less management during the 1970s there was a significant change of policy in the us aimed at removing massive areas of publicly owned forest from active management  effectively closing the gate the drivers behind this policy were well meaning it was intended to protect and preserve the habitat of endangered species but the unintended consequences have also had a substantial impact in the 1970s little thought was given to the carbon sequestration and storage potential of forests and climate change was not at the top of the agenda the west coast of the us was most substantially affected by these changes more than in the us south  but the data below looks at the example of mississippi which is primarily  working forest  and 88 in private ownership pine trees in mississippi working forest this is the location of draxs amite pellet mill  the charts below show an interesting comparison of forest ownership in mississippi where limited or no harvesting takes place and where active management for timber production occurs in the short term the total volume of timber stored per hectare is higher where no harvesting occurs this makes sense since the forest will keep growing until it reaches its climax point and succumbs to fire pest or disease average standing volume per unit area in the private sector where active management occurs is the lowest as timber is periodically removed for use in solid wood products remember that the oliver et al analysis which does not include regrowth showed that despite a shortterm reduction in forest carbon the total displacement of highcarbon materials with wood for structural timber and energy leads to a far higher emissions saving it is better to have a lower stock of carbon in a working forest and to be continually sequestering new carbon for storage in solid wood products average standing volume per acre by ownership class mississippi 2 comparing the average annual growth rates across all forest types in mississippi annual growth in the private sector is almost double that in the unharvested public forest this differential is increased even further if only commercial species like pine are considered and a comparison is made between planted well managed forests and those that are left to naturally regenerate average growth rates per acre by ownership class mississippi 3 the managed forest area is continually growing and storing more carbon at a materially higher rate than less actively managed forest as harvesting removes some forest carbon these products displace high carbon materials in construction and energy and new young forests are replacing the old ones we know that forests are not being lost and that the overall storage of carbon is increasing for example the drax catchment area analysis for the amite biomass wood pellet plant showed an increase in forest area of 5200 ha and an increase in volume of 11 million m 3  just in the area around the pellet mill but what happens to protected forest area the forest reserve with limited or no harvesting over the last 20 years the average annual loss of forest to wildfire in the us has been 278 million ha per year the same as the uks total area of productive forest according to the usfs fia database the average standing volume of forests in the us is 145 m 3 per ha although in the national park land this is 365 m 3 per ha therefore wildfires are responsible for the average annual combustion of 403 million m 3 of wood pa equal to the total annual wood harvest of the us or 25 billion m 3 if entirely in national parks one cubic metre equates to a similar quantity of co 2 released into the atmosphere each year therefore wildfires are responsible for between 407 million and 25 billion tonnes of co 2 emissions in the us each year 4  wildfires in the us starrs et al 2018 5 demonstrated that the risk of wildfire was significantly higher in federally owned reserved forest where harvesting and management were restricted compared to privately owned forests with active management in california the risk of wildfire in federal forest 200015 was almost double the risk in private forests where both had state firefighting resources the risk of fires in federal lands had increased by 93 since 195066 compared to only 33 in nonfederal forests due to the change in forest management practice in the 1970s forest fire in california closing the gate means that the carbon stock is maintained and grows in the short term but there is no opportunity for carbon to be stored in solid wood products no highcarbon materials are displaced concrete steel and fossil fuels and the rate of sequestration declines as the forest ages eventually the forest will reach its natural climax and die releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere the managed forest by contrast will have a lower standing volume at a certain point in time but will be in a continual cycle of sequestration storage and regrowth  with a much lower risk of fire and disease if managed correctly the rate of growth and standing volume will also increase over time how should we manage the forest forests are extremely variable there are a vast variety of tree species soil  geological features water regimes temperature climate and many other factors that combine to make unique ecosystems and forest landscapes some of these are rare and valuable for the exceptional assemblages they contain some are commonplace and widespread some are natural some manmade or influenced by human activity forests have many important roles to play and careful management is required in some cases that management may be protection preservation and monitoring in other cases it may be active harvesting and planting to optimise growth and carbon storage  cypress forests in the atchafalaya basin in louisiana are an example of a forest landscape where the suitable management practice is protection preservation and monitoring for each forest type and area we need to recognise the highest or best purposes for that land in the objectives set and carefully plan the management to optimise and sustain that value the primary value could be in species and habitat diversity or rarity provision of recreation and aesthetic value production of timber forest products and revenue generation carbon sequestration and storage water management and other ecosystem benefits most likely it will be a combination of several of these benefits therefore best management practice usually involves optimising each piece of forest land to provide the most effective combination of values forests can deliver many benefits if we are sensible about how we manage them in a recent study favero et al 2020 6 concluded that increased bioenergy demand increases forest carbon stocks thanks to afforestation activities and more intensive management relative to a nobioenergy case some natural forests however are converted to more intensive management with potential biodiversity lossesthe expanded use of wood for bioenergy will result in net carbon benefits but an efficient policy also needs to regulate

about in 2020 5 june 2020 power generation as we head into the 2020s  its an exciting time for energy a deeper level of climate consciousness has led to crucial changes in populations attitudes and thinking around how we power our lives  adapting to a new set of energy standards has become essential its also driving innovation in energy technology leading to the rise of a number of emerging technologies designed to support the global energy transition in new ways from domestic solar and wind generation to leaps forward in recycling and aeroplane fuel here are five new energy ideas in the 2020s pipeline miniature turbines for your garden think of a wind farm and you might think of giant structures located in remote windswept areas but thats quickly changing icewind is developing residential wind turbines that use the same generatorprincipal as largescale wind farms just on a much smaller scale a set of three outer and three inner vertical blades rotate when the wind passes through them providing spinning mechanical energy that passes through the generator and is converted to electricity constructed from durable stainless steel carbon fibre and aluminium the cw1000 model can handle wind speeds of up to 134 miles per hour to ensure theyre fit for domestic use the units are adapted to have a maximum height of just over 3 metres and make less than 40 decibels of noise  roughly equivalent to quiet conversation the icelandic company says it aims to decentralise and democratise energy generation by making wind power accessible to people anywhere in the world expanding solar to cover more surfaces as solar technology becomes more widespread and easier to implement more communities are turning to a prosumer approach and generating their own power roof panels to date have been the most common way to domestically capture and convert rays but solecco is taking it a step further offering solar roof tiles these work in the same way as roof panels using photovoltaic cells made of silicon to convert sunlight into electricity but by covering more surface area entire roofs can be used to generate solar energy rather than single panels environmental street furniture takes it a step further by bringing small scale solar generation into many aspects of the urban environment such as smart benches rubbish bins and solar lighting in green spaces this opens up opportunities for powering cities including incorporating charging stations and network connectivity which in turn enables social power sharing repurposing plastic global recycling rates currently sit at approximately 18 indicating there are still further steps to take in ensuring singleuse products are eliminated plastic is a major target in the war on disposal and for good reason by 2015 the world had produced over seven billion tonnes of plastic  greenology is tackling this by harnessing a process called pyrolysis to turn plastic into power by heating waste at a very high temperature without oxygen the plastic is breaks down without combusting this process produces biooils which can be used to create biofuels the benefits of this innovative approach to waste are twofold not only can plastic be repurposed which minimises the lasting impact singleuse plastic has on the planet but the creation of biofuel offers a power source for everything from transport to generating electricity storing heat for the home decarbonising heating is one of the global challenges yet to have a clear answer pumped heat ltd phl is developing a potential solution with its heat battery technology the company has found a solution that enables its devices to charge up and store electricity during offpeak hours when electricity is at its cheapest and then use this energy to generate heating and hot water for homes as it is required as the grid continues to decarbonise and as renewable power becomes cheaper and more accessible the electricity used to charge these units will approach zero carbon content the heat battery technology utilises vacuum insulation losing 10 times less heat than a conventional night storage heater in contrast air sourced heat pumps a more commonly used type of heat pump operate in real time when a home needs heating they take water at its delivery temperature which can be very cold during the winter months and heat it using electricity available at that time pumped heats storage system instead ensures there is always heat available maintaining a consistent temperature for hot water or central heating rather than just when there is an excess of electricity the company claims the benefit of using a heat battery system is that it is cheaper than an oil or lpg boiler in a world where renewable electricity production both domestic and on a national level is only set to increase wastepowered planes as some of the most fossil fuelreliant industries in the world travel and transport are actively seeking alternative and more sustainable ways to keep them powered in long run velocys aims to do this using waste the company is developing sustainable fuels for aviation and heavy goods transport using the fischertropsch method of gasifying waste  this involves turning waste materials  such as domestic refuse and woody waste  into clean jet fuel using a catalytic chemical reaction where synthesis gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen are converted into liquid hydrocarbons that can then be used for fuel not only does this make use of waste products that could have ended up in landfill but it produces much cleaner fuels that emit less particle matter and harmful pollutants into the atmosphere as we enter a new decade of invention the world is focusing on more sustainable alternatives to power our lives and these innovative solutions to current environmental issues will continue to inspire creativity tags decarbonisation  sustainability  technology  wind power  transport  renewable energy is renewablerich the new oilrich 2 june 2020 power generation were all familiar with the phrase oilrich nations but as low carbon energy sources become ever more important to meeting global demand renewable energy could become a global export with a future favouring zerocarbon and even negative emissions innovation here are some countries that are not only harnessing their natural resources to make more renewable energy but are making progress in storing and exporting it could these new opportunities lead us to one day deem them renewablerich could europe import its solar power supply with the largest concentrated solar farm in the world  morocco is already streets ahead in its ability to capture and convert sunlight into power the 3000 hectare solar complex known as noorouarzazate  has a capacity of 580 megawatts mw which provides enough power for a city twice the size of marrakesh noorouarzazate power plant morocco image source acwa power its uses curved mirrors to direct sunlight into a singular beam that creates enough heat to melt salt in a central tower this stores the heat and  when needed  is used to create steam which spins a turbine and generates electricity this has helped keep morocco on course to achieve its goal of deriving 42 of its power from renewable sources by the end of 2020 which potentially means a surplus in the coming years morocco already has 14 gigawatts gw of interconnection with spain  and another 700 mw is scheduled to come online before 2026 the countrys close proximity to europe could make its solar capacity a source of power across the continent africas geothermal potential olkaria ii geothermal power plant in kenya kenya was the first african nation to embrace geothermal energy and has now been using it for decades in 1985 kenyas geothermal generation produced 45 mw of power  30 years later the country now turns over 630 mw  kenyas ample generation of geothermal electricity is due to an abundance of steam energy in the underground volcanic wells of olkaria in the great rift valley in 2015 the region was responsible for providing 47 of the countrys power currently the olkaria region is thought to have a potential capacity of 2 gw of power which could help to provide a source of clean energy for kenyas neighbours however there is potential for the rest of east africa to generate its own geothermal power in this region of the continent there is an estimated 20 gw of power generation capacity possible from stored geothermal energy while the demand for the creation of usable grids that can connect multiple countries is high kenya is currently expanding its own grid installing a planned 3600 miles of new electrical wiring across the country winds of change chinas position in the renewable energy market is already up top with continuous investment in solar and hydro power giving it a renewable capacity of more than 700 gw the country is also home to the worlds largest onshore wind farm in the form of the gansu wind farm project which is made up of over 7000 turbines  it is set to have a capacity of 20 gw by the end of 2020 bringing the nationwide installed wind capacity to 250 gw with china exporting more than 20000 gigawatthours gwh of electricity in 2018  large scale renewable projects can have a widereaching effect beyond its borders southasia is the primary market but excesses of power in western china have stoked ideas of exporting power as far away as germany  can the us store the worlds carbon in the quest for zerocarbon energy it wont just be nations that can export excess energy that could stand to profit  those that can import emissions could also benefit while many countries are developing the capabilities to capture carbon dioxide co 2  storing it safely and permanently is another question  having underground facilities that can store co 2 creates an opportunity to import and sequester carbon as a service for other nations norway is already doing it but the us has the greatest potential thanks to its abundance of large underground storage capabilities the global ccs institute highlights the us as the country most prepared to deploy carbon capture and storage ccs at scale thanks to its vast landscape history of injecting co 2 in enhanced oil recovery and favourable government policies the petra nova plant in texas is also known as the worlds largest carbon capture facility  the coalpower station captured more than 1 million tonnes of co 2 within the first 10 months of operating as a 654 mw unit carbon capture facility at the petra nova coalfired power plant texas usa chiles hydrogen innovation hydrogen is becoming increasingly relevant as an energy source thanks to its ability to generate electricity and power transport while releasing far fewer emissions than other fossil fuels chile was an early proponent of energy sharing with its hydrogen programme the country uses solar electricity generated in the atacama desert which sees 3000 hours of sunlight a year to power hydrogen production in a process called electrolysis which uses electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen chile plans to export the gas to japan and south korea  but with global demand for hydrogen set to grow highervolume furtherreaching exporting of the countrys hydrogen could soon be on the way going forward these green innovations  from carbon storage to geothermal potential  could increasingly be shared between countries and continents in an attempt to lower the overall carbon footprint of the worlds energy this could create a global power shift toward nations which rather than having high capacity for fossil fuel extraction can instead use a different set of natural resources to generate store and export cleaner energy tags decarbonisation
