groundbreaking carbon recycling project reactfirst that is set to transform the uks food production systems has launched today 17 july 2020 17 july 2020 the project will obtain critical data about a new singlecell protein used in fish and poultry feed that is set to sustainably transform the uks aquaculture and poultry industries reactfirst is the uks firstever scalable route to the sustainable generation of protein capturing the carbon dioxide from bioenergy generation it launches with financial support from the government in the form of 3m funding from innovate uk and will contribute to meeting the uks net zero climate change commitment as well as to the circular economy reactfirst is led by carbon recycling biotechnology company deep branch  which has pioneered a process that uses microbes to convert carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and turns them into highvalue proteins the project launches with the firstofitskind endtoend valuechainwide consortium of ten industry and academic partners which all share a commitment to tackling the global climate crisis and the goal of achieving neutral  negative carbon emissions the members of the reactfirst consortium are deep branch  experts in recycling industrial co 2 into costcompetitive protein for highvalue sustainable animal feed drax  the uks largest single site renewable electricity generator and pioneer of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs biomar  one of the worlds largest aquafeed producers ab agri  a global agrifood business and leading producer of monogastric feed sainsburys  recognised

university of nottingham sbrc nottingham  the worldleading gas fermentation research group the institute of aquaculture university of stirling  the uks leading aquaculture research centre nottingham trent university school of animal rural and environmental sciences  experts in assessing sustainable poultry production innogen university of edinburgh  experts in value chain integration and responsible innovation commenting on the significance of the reactfirst project peter rowe ceo of deep branch explains currently most animal feed protein sources are imported from overseas making the uk dependent on complicated and fragile supply chains reactfirst has been created to focus solely on addressing this problem projects like reactfirst are key to help the industry move towards achieving netzero emissions its solution uses the technology developed by deep branch but whilst this has huge transformative potential commercialisation is not possible without cooperation with key stakeholders across the value chain reactfirst addresses this with its consortium of industrial and academic organisations and even though relationships within these verticals are well established the project represents the first time that the resources and expertise of all parties have been unified towards a single goal deep branch biotechnology pilot plant within draxs ccus incubation area the work of reactfirst centres around the use of microbes to convert co 2 directly from industrial emissions into highvalue products specifically a totally novel new type of singlecell protein or scp called proton tm produced by deep branch this is used in fish and poultry feed and represents a new way of generating more sustainable animal feeds says rowe reactfirst will obtain critical data about cost digestibility nutritional quality and carbon footprint of proton tm  each of the projects partners is playing an active role in the development of the process and generation of this critical data harnessing their involvement and shared knowledge in the field of carbon emissions the production supply chain and groundbreaking biotechnology and technology to create sustainable protein feed sources that will contribute to reducing the environmental impact of meat production systems speaking about the reactfirst project science minister amanda solloway said  to protect our environment and meet our worldleading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 we must harness the very best of uk innovation across all sectors supporting the most creative and pioneering ideas from robotics assisting our farmers in fruit picking to technology that converts co 2 to clean animal feed the incredible and cuttingedge projects we are backing today represent the future of farming working with the best of british science we are accelerating the transition to net zero food production boosting jobs and productivity and driving forward the uks economic recovery melanie welham executive director bbsrc part of uk research and innovation adds this project and others like it will help increase uk agricultural productivity and global competitiveness at ukri our aim is to turnthe food production sector into a beacon of innovation brilliant ideas like this one go a long way to making food production more sustainable efficient and less carbon intensive but they need support to get them from the drawing board to the farm ukris funding programme for this sector is ongoing in our current funding round weve awarded funding to 9 innovative companies in the future we encourage businesses to come forward with fresh ideas to help uk agriculture reactfirst partners jason shipstone evp innovation drax group last year announced its worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and has been working with deep branch to explore the feasibility of using its carbon dioxide emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products through the reactfirst project drax is providing further support through its expertise in site integration and co 2 lifecycle analysis as drax groups chief innovation officer jason shipstone explains by working with other businesses through the reactfirst consortium together we can help more difficult to decarbonise sectors like agriculture to make positive changes to address the climate crisis global innovators in high performance aquaculture feed biomar is involved in production of trial feeds and testing of the high potential raw material proton tm  focusing on sustainability performance digestibility and other parameters essential for fish health and growth paddy campbell vp salmon at biomar group explains aquaculture is expected to double production by 2050 however to achieve this we need feeds with minimal environmental impact the reactfirst project is the first step towards the commercial development of a new potentially gamechanging protein source proton tm  using new technology to capture waste co 2 and creating highvalue sustainable protein suitable for the aquaculture industry at biomar we are constantly seeking innovative raw materials that dont compete with human food production and nutrients from byproducts that minimise waste we are excited to be part of this project to see how proton tm will perform in aquaculture feed stated paddy campbell vp salmon biomar group ab agris role in reactfirst is to complement the work of its consortiums technology and science partners with its insights into animal feed markets customer needs and end consumer demands the agrifood company uses its expertise and experience to ensure end products are viable and plays an integral role in driving a more responsible supply of protein around the world valerie schuster strategy director at ab agri comments the world around us is changing in the past there has been a growing gap between the animal feed industry and end consumers who nowadays want to know more about the meat and fish they are eating where they come from and whether the animals they consume have been raised responsibly in turn the industry is obliged to share more information about the feed animals consume where it comes from and how we do more with less to meet the needs of a growing population while preserving the planet reactfirst provides a way of doing exactly this by growing singlecell protein using co 2 emissions from industry it creates a new scalable and circular protein which is the opportunity to help feed manufacturers and farmers and improve animal nutrition and wellbeing via a highquality ingredient that is consistent and can easily be traced back to its origins scientists from the university of stirlings institute of aquaculture are tasked with investigating the feasibility of microbial singlecell protein scp as a substitute for marine and terrestrial meal in salmon aquafeeds the institutes dr mónica betancor is leading the study and explains the project aims to evaluate and validate a scp produced from industrial emissions of co 2  with an amino acid profile tailored to meet the enduser requirements of the aquafeed industry and also support and improve the sustainability and development of uk aquaculture by contributing to uk food security aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector with the uk salmon industry expected to increase significantly such growth can only be achieved in a sustainable manner by replacing the traditionally used marine ingredients in aquafeeds  fish meal and fish oil  for more sustainable options the main alternative to fish meal in aquafeeds is vegetable meal however this has its constraints and singlecell protein is an excellent alternative as it is nutritionally optimised to meet the demands of aquaculture our work in the reactfirst project will determine its feasibility as a substitute for other protein sources in the feeds for farmed salmon polly douglas aquaculture innovation manager at saic  adds reactfirst is a highly innovative way of turning the co 2 produced by another process into a key component of our food chain providing a sustainable source of feed for fish it could make a significant contribution to food security in the uk while reducing the supply chains carbon footprint  both of which have seldom been of more relevance the synthetic biology research centre sbrc at the university of nottingham is one of the largest research centres of its kind in the world and is focused on engineering bacteria to make industrially useful products from single carbon feedstocks  in particular greenhouse gases co 2 and methane  with the overall goal to reduce reliance on petrochemicals by creating technologies that convert single carbon feedstocks into the chemicals fuels and products society needs including animal feed of its role in reactfirst sbrc director professor nigel minton says the sbrc has created a concentration of knowledge and expertise in aerobic gas fermentation for the uk reactfirst is a fantastic opportunity for the sbrc to work with likeminded organisations that share the passion to create sustainable routes to animal feed production systems the project has the potential to make a real difference reactfirsts joint industry academia relationship is a conduit for the translation and adoption of ukrifunded research it is an important output of the sbrcs research which will lead to significant outcomes from the sbrcs research base and we are delighted to provide sbrcs unique facilities and expertise to support towards developing sustainable animal feed and in improving their nutritional characteristics experts from nottingham trent universitys poultry research unit are tasked with investigating and benchmarking the nutritional quality of proton as a poultry feed ingredient advising on the processes to optimally prepare it for inclusion in the poultry feed and conducting poultry nutrition trials once the nutritional evaluation is complete ntu will work with the feed companies within the reactfirst consortium to produce kpis for improved protein ingredients profile based on commercial feed matrix data which will be used to develop a report for the european food safety authority to register the new feed materials dr emily burton associate professor in sustainable food production at ntu says the poultry sector has much to be proud of in terms of low carbon meat production but reactfirst could catapult the sector into a completely new league as well as providing access to a sustainable protein source the project will help create stability for the animal production sector because feed represents about half of the total production costs for meat poultry along with providing the reactfirst project with marketfocused guidance throughout the lifecycle of the project sainsburys is assisting with stakeholder mapping and engagement in order to ensure maximum potential market acceptance penetration and endtoend value sainsburys recently pledged to become net zero across its own operations by 2040 and reactfirsts focus aligns with these wider values as judith batchelar director of sainsburys brand explains our customers care about where our products come from and they put their trust in us to do the right thing on their behalf were proud to work closely with farmers growers and suppliers in the uk and around the world to build resilient sustainable and fairlytraded supply chains that will help more people live better today tomorrow and in the future being part of the reactfirst consortium is an outstanding opportunity to produce feeds for our farmed fish and chicken with 6575 percent smaller carbon footprints than existing feeds no requirements for arable land minimal water usage and so we build more resilience into our supply chains for animal feed reactfirst should help the aquaculture and poultry feed industries move towards selfsufficiency from a dietary protein perspective and reduce the instability of animal feed prices experienced by farmers as well as assessing the economic societal and environmental benefits of proton tm  a team at innogen institute at the university of edinburgh is supporting reactfirst to innovate responsibly and engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure wider acceptance of the technology the universitys reactfirst work is being led by alan raybold and joyce tait who are both involved in research and teaching programmes in the university of edinburghs global academy of agriculture and food security  an interdisciplinary hub committed to transforming global agrifood systems to achieve food and environmental security alan raybould chair of innovation in the life sciences at the university explains reactfirst is an exciting opportunity for innogen to work with organisations throughout the animalfeed value chain to maximise the benefits of proton tm and increase the sustainability of animalprotein production systems joyce tait founding director of innogen and technical author of the british standards institution bsi standard for responsible innovation  pas440  adds innogens experience in supporting responsible innovation from a business point of view means we are ideally placed to enable reactfirst to deliver and demonstrate a responsible innovation approach for proton tm production and commercialisation including consumer acceptance geoff simm  director of the global academy of agriculture and food security adds
