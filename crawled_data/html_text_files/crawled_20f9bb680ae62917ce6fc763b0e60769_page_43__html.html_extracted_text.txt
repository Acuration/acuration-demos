Press Release
Smart Green Shipping Alliance partners with Drax and Ultrabulk to cut shipping supply chain emissions
20 November 2018
Press releases

Drax, operator of the UK’s largest power station, is partnering with the Smart Green Shipping Alliance (SSGA), leading dry bulk cargo transporter Ultrabulk, and Humphreys Yacht Design, naval architects of Dame Ellen McArthur’s ‘
Kingfisher
’ yacht, to tackle the mounting issue of CO
2
emissions from the shipping industry.
A £100,000 12-month feasibility study funded by InnovateUK, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and private investors has begun, which will examine the potential of fitting an innovative sail technology called Fastrig onto Ultrabulk ships importing biomass into the UK, for cutting both carbon emissions and costs.
The shipping industry emits roughly 3% of global CO
2
and other greenhouse gas emissions (CO
2
-equivalent), or approximately 1 billion tonnes of CO
2
and other GHGs per year.  That’s over twice as much as the UK’s total emissions, from all sources.
Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire has transformed its business having converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal – it is now Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project. Last year, it imported 6.8 million tonnes of the compressed wood pellets in 221 deliveries to the ports of Immingham, Hull, Tyne and Liverpool, to enable it to generate 14% of the UK’s renewable electricity.
Using biomass at Drax has delivered carbon savings of more than 80% compared to coal – this includes supply chain emissions, but shipping remains one of the most carbon intensive parts of the biomass supply chain. Drax’s desire to drive down emissions even further enabled Smart Green Shipping to partner with an ‘end user’ looking for the lowest carbon cargo provider.
Diane Gilpin, CEO and Founder of Smart Green Shipping Alliance said:
“This is a project that could really make a difference to the way the industry operates. Drax’s determination to cut carbon emissions creates real demand. Reducing emissions is good business, it saves costs and improves long-term operational certainty. This study aims to find the ‘sweet spot’ between reducing emissions and saving fuel costs.
“We’re engaging across shipping, working with port owners, shipbuilders, cargo owners’, and financiers to design pragmatic and effective new systems solutions. The prototypes we’re looking to develop are really exciting. A 21st century sailing-hybrid ship will look as much like the Cutty Sark as a Tesla does a Model T Ford.”
Gilpin is an expert on the UK government’s Clean Maritime Council, which will devise a strategy to reduce emissions from the shipping sector.
UK Shipping Minister Nusrat Ghani said at the Council’s inaugural meeting:
“The Clean Maritime Plan will bring new opportunities for Britain’s businesses to design, develop and sell green solutions to this global challenge.”
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner said:
“Smart Green Shipping Alliance’s pioneering efforts to deliver cleaner, greener transportation could help achieve the clean growth required for the UK to meet its climate targets. If we’re serious about meeting those targets, decarbonising transportation is the next big challenge.
“The combination of green shipping with renewables makes an even greater contribution to decarbonisation globally. This is a key development in achieving Drax’s aim – to deliver a zero carbon, low cost future for all.”
The innovation leads on the project, Rob and Tom Humphreys of Humphreys Yacht Design, explained how their team’s background in ocean racing has helped them to make technical advances in an industry that has used the same technology for the past century.
Tom said, “Transferring knowledge and technologies from offshore yacht racing to improve the performance of commercial merchant ships mirrors the way Formula One drives design development in the automotive industry.
“We’ve worked on America’s Cup and Volvo Ocean Race campaigns, competing at the highest level. Applying this technology to the commercial shipping industry means that we are able to make very significant fuels saving advances”, said Rob
The first six months of the project will be a technical feasibility study, establishing the mechanical parameters for retrofitting the Fastrig solution onto ships. The next six months will focus on putting together a business case and calculating detailed costings for the project.  The aim is to retrofit a ship with the Fastrig technology – depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, the launch of the Commercial Demonstrator could be done as soon as 2021.
The technology could drive down not only carbon emissions but also cost. Diane Gilpin explained, “Fuel prices are vulnerable to oil market volatility, but once the technology is developed, wind is free at the point of use.  The first onshore wind turbines were single devices producing 45KW; now we’re seeing fleets of 10MW producing energy, without subsidy. We can expect to mirror that speed of transition in the shipping industry.”
The SGSA has been pioneering the uptake of renewables in the maritime industry since 2014, identifying wind power as the first choice of exploration. The long-term aim of the company is to develop commercially viable, zero-emission vessels. The eventual aim is to combine renewable energy from wind power with bio-fuels.
Per Lange, CEO of Ultrabulk said:
“We are very much looking forward to working with our partners at Drax and Smart Green Shipping Alliance. The feasibility study initiated is very much in line with the environmental focus of Ultrabulk and the shipping industry at large.
“We have made considerable improvements to NOx and SOx emissions; the latter being the focus as in 2019 the SOx emission has to be reduced by 85 per cent. As an industry we are under way to deliver on these limits, but we shall naturally not stop there.
“CO
2
still needs to be reduced. As well as the Shipping Industry’s commitment through International Maritime Organisation targets, Ultrabulk is committed to achieving significant additional reductions. The Smart Green Shipping Alliance is an exciting step in that direction.”
Dr Jenifer Baxter, Head of Engineering, IMechE said:
“This is an exciting project that addresses one of the more difficult decarbonisation challenges and represents the ingenuity of engineering that the Institution of Mechanical Engineers seeks to support.
“Shipping has been a part of our global transportation system for hundreds of years moving through wind and man-power to coal and diesel power. This project presents a new phase taking us full circle forward again to wind power, leading the way with state-of-the-art power and engine technologies enabling shipping to remain relevant and commercially viable in an increasingly low-carbon world.”

Notes to Editors
The International Maritime Organisation, the London-based specialist UN agency responsible for the safety of shipping and its environmental impact, in April this year reached a landmark greenhouse gas agreement, which set two key goals: Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping to decline by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels, and as an interim goal carbon intensity of shipping to decline by 40% by 2030. The International Chamber of Shipping has said the future of the sector lies beyond fossil fuels, and that the IMO agreement sends a strong signal for the development of low and zero carbon propulsion technologies in the shipping sector.

Drax Group
Drax operates the largest power station in the UK, based at Selby in North Yorkshire. Since converting four of its six generating units to use biomass instead of coal, it has become the biggest renewable power generator in the country, producing enough renewable electricity for four million households.
As well as the engineering skill and expertise needed to convert the power station from coal to biomass, the team at Drax also had to create an entirely new global supply chain to provide the quantity of biomass required to fuel its boilers – the majority of which comes from North America and Europe.
Its biomass generating units deliver carbon savings of more than 80% compared to when they used coal – this includes supply chain emissions.
It is committed to reducing its emissions further and helping other businesses to decarbonise through its B2B electricity supply businesses, Haven Power and Opus Energy, which provide 100% renewable power to more than 350,000 business sites.
Drax is starting an innovative Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage pilot later this year which could help the power station deliver negative emissions, meaning the power it produces will help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere – vital for global efforts to tackle climate change.

Energy revolution creating a two-tier economy leaving millions of families and businesses behind
Press releases

Researchers from Imperial College London and E4tech warn of a two-tier economy emerging as Britain goes through an ‘energy revolution’.
Revolution taking place in UK energy system could unlock new growth, lower energy bills and smarter living but many in society will lose out.
Report reveals regional divides for the first time as communities and businesses in some areas power ahead while others risk being left behind.
London and Scotland are pulling ahead while the North of England and East Midlands lag furthest behind.
The research
shows that businesses and families in London and Scotland are better placed to take advantage of the benefits of the ‘energy revolution’, including cheaper energy bills, electric vehicles and smart appliances.  Meanwhile, the North of England and East Midlands lag furthest behind.
Conducted independently by researchers from Imperial College London and E4tech, facilitated by Imperial Consultants and commissioned by Drax Group,
the report
breaks down the energy revolution into 20 metrics for the power, transport and buildings sectors, to provide a barometer of national and regional progress. Achievement against each of these metrics is scored as ‘not on track’, ‘within 90% of target’ or ‘ahead of target’.
Commenting on his team’s findings, Imperial’s Dr Iain Staffell said:
“The country is going through an energy revolution. We are creating an energy system which will power our future economy and help tackle climate change.
“But, our research reveals that Britain is at risk creating a two-tier economy, leaving millions of families and businesses less well equipped to enjoy cheaper bills and better health outcomes. Our concern is they will not be offered the same opportunities as people living in regions which are modernising their energy infrastructure.”
Responding to the findings Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Great Britain needs more secure, clean energy to compete in the future economy. There is an energy revolution underway which will deliver it – but this report uncovers worrying regional divides as we go through that transition.
“Drax is already working hard to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future for all. We will work with all our partners including governments to ensure no-one is left behind through the energy revolution.”
Who’s ahead and behind in the energy revolution?
Differences in levels of government investment, local policies and average household income have resulted in more affluent regions leading in the energy transition.
London leads progress jointly with Scotland because its transport system is the country’s greenest. As public transport, walking and cycling are more dominant in London, a Londoner’s carbon footprint from transport is up to 2.5 times less than residents in other regions. The capital also receives 45% of national funds for rail electrification, resulting in the country’s lowest carbon emissions from rail.
It is also cheaper, on average, to own an electric car in London than in any other part of the country. This is due to the average London driver travelling shorter distances and the exemption of electric vehicles (EV) from London’s Congestion Charge.
Scotland leads in the energy revolution with London due to its successful shift from fossil fuels to renewable generated electricity. The number of EV charging points in Scotland is also high compared to the number of vehicles: despite the low population density, the average Scottish household is around 2km from a charging point, but with the lifetime cost of running an EV being the highest in Scotland and Wales, this is affecting uptake in these areas.
Residential homes in leading regions London, Scotland and the East are also more energy efficient, and more likely to score high A-C Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings, and have fewer buildings rated F and G.
By comparison, all of the regions lagging behind, including Wales, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and the north of England suffer from particularly low EPC ratings.  The cost of heating, combined with lower average incomes in these areas mean that fuel poverty rates are particularly high. As the country transitions to more electric heating in future, this is likely to result in increasing energy bills in these regions unless homes can be made more energy efficient, or the cost of electric heating can be reduced, particularly for vulnerable residents.
Which sectors are ahead in the energy revolution?
The research also highlights sector differences. While work to reduce the carbon impact of the power sector is on track due to the closure of coal stations and growth in renewables, work to electrify heating, improve the energy efficiency of homes and electrify the railway is falling behind.

Editor’s Notes
‘Energising Britain’
report was commissioned by Drax Group and conducted independently by academics from Imperial College London, and consultants from E4tech, facilitated through the College’s consultancy company – Imperial Consultants.
The metrics used to assess the state of transition in the energy system are presented as a ‘barometer’. Each barometer sets out three points:
The end target for the transformation for the target year in the scenario (e.g. total number of EV charging points in 2030)
The current state of transformation (e.g. number of charging points operational), and
An indication of where we would have to be to meet the 2030 target (e.g. number of charging points in 2018).
The end target for transformation are based on 2030 targets from the National Grid Future Energy Scenarios (FES), the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Committee on Climate Change (CCC)
The geographical scope refers to the 11 regions of Great Britain (Scotland, Wales, and 9 in England). Northern Ireland was excluded due to lack of available data.
The metrics examined by sector include:
The Power System. This section includes national and regional barometers for 1. Carbon intensity of grid electricity 2. Storage deployment 3. Transmission capacity and 4. Smart meter roll-out. A regional barometer is not presented for interconnection as this is a country-to-country issue.
Energy in Transport. This section includes national and regional barometers for 1. GHG emissions reductions 2. Plug-in vehicles in the car fleet 3. Electric vehicle charging points 4. Hydrogen refuelling stations 5. Electric and hydrogen buses and 6. Ultra-low emission heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). A regional barometer is not represented for rail emissions; this was examined across the entire British rail industry.
Energy in Buildings. This section includes national and regional barometers for 1. Energy efficiency by energy performance certificate (EPC) ratings 2. Electrification of heating and 3. Heat Pump Deployment. A regional barometer is not represented for fuel poverty as there were no milestones available for 2018.
Progress in the industrial sector is not examined due to a lack of data.

Drax generates £1.6bn and supports over 17,500 jobs in the UK
12 November 2018
Press releases

The findings were revealed in a new report looking at the economic impact of Drax’s UK operations, which includes Drax Power Station – the country’s biggest renewable power generator, which produces enough renewable electricity for four million homes.
Based on Drax’s operations in the energy sector and its use of British businesses across its supply chain, the analysis by Oxford Economics estimates that the company contributed £1.65 billion to the economy and supported 17,500 jobs last year.
The vast majority of the Group’s impact was felt outside London and the South East; of the £1.65bn Gross Value Added by Drax Group, £142m was in London, meaning 91% of the Group’s economic impact was experienced outside of the capital.
Haven Power
Employment supported by Drax’s activities covered a wide range of sectors including high-skilled manufacturing of industrial components, engineering and technical machinery, construction, IT, professional business services and transport.
Researchers at Oxford Economics used three measures to calculate Drax’s GDP contribution: the economic activity associated with the day-to-day running of the business; the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers; and the wages the company’s employees and suppliers’ employees spend in their local area.
A breakdown of the GDP generated by Drax Group shows all regions of the UK benefited. Highlights include:
£431 million created in Drax’s heartland of Yorkshire and the Humber, where its power station is located, a rise from £419 million in 2016.
1,100 jobs for the North East and £77m contributed to the local economy.
£273 million generated and 2,500 jobs supported in the East of England, where one of Drax Group’s B2B power supply businesses Haven Power, is based.
750 jobs supported and £51 million generated in Wales, home to the Cardiff offices of Opus Energy – Drax’s other B2B retail business, which supplies energy to SMEs
700 jobs supported in Scotland and £68 million generated in its economy.
850 jobs sustained and £64 million contributed to GDP in the South West.
Apprentices at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire
Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner, said:
“As a British energy company, we are committed to working with UK businesses right across our supply chain. This report shows that Drax now supports more than 17,500 jobs across the UK and our proposed acquisition of a number of assets from Scottish Power will bolster these numbers further.
Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group
“With the power station’s sophisticated supply chain and our growing retail business, we are making a positive economic contribution in every region of the UK. We are an important player in an energy sector and are keen to do whatever we can to help the country achieve a low cost, zero carbon future.
“Since upgrading two thirds of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, Drax has become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
“We plan to stop using coal well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline, with proposals to repower our remaining coal generating units to use gas.
“This will enable more renewables onto the system, paving the way for increased carbon savings across the UK and helping us to meet our climate targets.”
Opus Energy
Osman Ismail, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics, said:
“Drax Group makes an important economic contribution to Yorkshire and the Humber, and the UK more widely. Its activities generated almost £1.6 billion in GDP last year, and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation.
“Opus Energy was successfully been onboarded into the group, in 2017, and Drax’s principal activities of generating energy and supplying energy services to businesses directly and indirectly impacts a number of different regions in the UK in terms of both job creation and contribution to GDP.”

Notes to editors:
Drax recently converted the fourth of its six generating units from coal to use sustainable biomass – around 70% of the power produced at the power station is now renewable.
It has plans to repower its two remaining coal generating units to use gas, which are being considered by the planning inspectorate. If approved, Drax could stop using coal well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline.
It also has plans to start the first Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage pilot project of its kind in Europe this year. BECCs technology is vital if we are to meet our climate targets. It could enable the power produced at Drax to become carbon negative, meaning it would help to reduce the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere.

Ipswich-based Haven Power increases contribution to the UK economy by 43% to £696 million
Press releases

The findings were revealed in a new report looking at the economic impact of British energy company Drax Group.
Haven Power
joined the Group in 2009 and has grown to become a leading supplier of electricity to British businesses, including Manchester Airport Group and Thames Water. It employs 450 people across its two offices at Ransomes Europark, near Ipswich and Franciscan House in the town centre
The report also found that in the East of England alone, Haven Power and Drax combined to generate £273 million in the local economy, up £50 million from 2016 and support 2,500 jobs.
Researchers at Oxford Economics used three measures to calculate Haven Power’s GDP contribution: the economic activity associated with the day-to-day running of the business; the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers; and the wages the company’s employees and suppliers’ employees spend in their local area.
Employment supported by Haven Power’s activities covered a wide range of sectors including IT, professional business services and transport.
Drax Group Retail CEO, Jonathan Kini, said:
“This report shows that in addition to being a leading supplier of energy to British businesses, Haven Power also plays an important role in the local and national economy. Through the people we employ and the businesses we use, we have supported thousands of jobs and generated nearly £700 million of economic activity in Ipswich and beyond.”
Paul Sheffield, Haven Power Chief Operations Officer, said:
“We’re a well-established business and have strong links here, having been founded in Ipswich in 2006. In addition to employing people from the local area, we use a number of businesses in the region to provide us with products and services that enable us to deliver the best possible experience for our customers.”
Sandy Martin, Member of Parliament for Ipswich, said:
“I’m proud that Haven Power, an energy supplier with an impressive nationwide operation is based here in Ipswich. Haven creates and maintains employment, contributes substantially to the local economy and plays an active role in engaging with the local community”
