power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station what does the internet of things mean for energy a more connected world could transform the relationship between energy generators suppliers and customers 2 june 2017 electrification internet of things iot technology which connects everyday appliances to one another allowing them to collect data and become smart presents an exciting view of the modern home or workspace the future iotenabled office or household is one with autonomous appliances remoteoperated thermostats and fridges that monitor their contents and reorder supplies when they run low you may never go hungry again theres arguably an even brighter future for the iots potential in industry  it can bring about value through applications like predictive maintenance and performance optimisation on paper these two scenarios  that of industrial optimisation and convenience throughout our daily lives  might seem worlds away but james robbins chief information officer at drax is thinking about how to bring them together  particularly when it comes to energy use central to the approach is a question could a better understanding of how households and businesses use energy change how its generated and provided the importance of data at its heart the iot is about data what data you collect and how you use it determines what value you can create says robbins he explains whether youre talking about the iot big data artificial intelligence ai or robotics  theyre all the modernisation of information collection and use and nowhere is this more applicable than at a largescale power station  at drax were used to managing whats basically our own private iot in the station he explains the realtime control systems we have for the generators and the grid are essentially a bunch of sensors tied to a central network these sensors collect data from the power station which then help optimise it for better performance the same approach to data collection can have benefits for bill payers too tracking energy use in the workspace and home connected devices like smart meters can bring a precise level of insight into energy usage in the home and places of work which can benefit both end users and suppliers of heat and power electricity generators and heating fuel suppliers can use this data to better manage their output by being able to predict how and when it will be required for end users it can help them and their energy suppliers more accurately track what they use where they use it and how they could use it more efficiently for example using iot technology a gas or wood pellet for heat supplier may be able to identify that a home can make substantial cost savings just by turning down their heating by one degree sensors and smart technology can give us that insight says robbins this level of optimisation is already possible to a degree using existing tools but robbins sees a future with greater possibilities for example with comprehensive datasets suppliers can compare business owners energy use with others in the same sector and region to highlight efficiencies the whole thing is about making it easier for us to serve the customer says robbins and the better the dataset the more exotic the services could be just looking at meters means we can only really talk to the bill payer but who else in the home or workplace could we engage with to get them to conserve energy for instance we could develop a game for child in the house thats linked to energy use where they get points for turning off lights or turning down heating he explains the gamification of energy use is  at this stage  just an idea robbins says but it is exactly the kind of thing that better data allows energy suppliers and generators to think about a challenging journey but an exciting one the iot approach to energy generation and use wont be without its challenges  security being one major concern but there will also be substantial technical and standardisation issues any provider keen to leverage iot must tackle to make it a truly effective technology in the 80s you couldnt play a vhs cassette in a betamax player robbins explains the compatibility issue with iot could be an even bigger problem  all these gadgets need to be built into an architecture that can handle them and make them work together consider the socalled smart meter that provides data for a customers itemised bill the bill payer is told that a tumble dryer in their home is using a significant proportion of the power they are paying for the problem is that their appliances and devices have not been meshed together in a way that gives the system sufficient context about the customers situation in the worstcase scenario the customer asks for a refund and switches supplier because they dont actually have a tumble dryer robbins and his team are working with drax suppliers to make sure that compatibility and context dont become a problem he aims to ensure that unintended consequences in the groups use of iot are only of the positive variety by investing in backoffice infrastructure that can use big data processing to ingest and analyse meter data down to the 10second level drax can take advantage of smart tech when it arrives in earnest its an exciting period of technological advancement  but as robbins is keen to point out its only the start itll probably only be over the next few years that we actually begin to really understand how to leverage iot data when we pass the tipping point of user adoption when that happens well be starting a very exciting journey with a clearer purpose  to spot and solve meaningful problems faced by people and businesses in context in realtime share related stories press releases on
