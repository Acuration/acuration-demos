power station refurbishing a 300tonne generator core within the heart of a power station it takes collaborative working with a multinational team of engineers and enormous rollers in a purpose built clean room to do this moneysaving job 6 december 2017 power generation at the centre of drax power station in a corner of the cavernous turbine hall is a white box the inside of this box is spotlessly clean not only are its white walls free of dirt they are free of even dust but there is one outlier inside this sterile environment a 300tonne chunk of industrial equipment this equipment is a generator core  the central component for converting the mechanical energy to electrical power the core is driven by the steam turbine ninety tonnes of generator rotor spinning at 3000 rpm with just millimetres of clearance from the core produce 660 megawatts mw of electricity thats enough  645 mw when exported from drax into the national grid  to power a city the size of sheffield the generator is a serious piece of industrial machinery and despite the pristine conditions this white box is the site of serious engineering a process normally done by largescale manufacturers in dedicated factories rewinding a generator core  as the process is called  is a major operation no other uk facility is capable of doing this complex job so its here in a white box in the middle of an operational power station in north yorkshire that a team of engineers is undertaking work that will secure the generators use for decades this is the drax rewinding facility how a generator works a generator consists of two main components a spinning rotor and a stationary stator the rotor which is directly connected to the main turbine and spins 50 times every second sits inside the stator both the stator and the rotor contain a large number of copper coils known as windings these windings are what carry the electrical current the rotor acts like a very strong electromagnet which when a voltage is applied produces a strong magnetic field because the rotor sits inside the stator this magnetic field intersects the copper windings of the stator and induces a voltage in these windings allowing current to flow this voltage is then brought out of the stator and passed through a stepup transformer where it is increased to a level suitable for transmission through the national grid the stator core is made from many elements with hundreds of thousands of laminations 84 watercooled insulated copper bars each 11 metres long and weighing 200kg forming the windings various insulating materials blocks packing wedges and condition monitoring equipment generator stators can operate for decades without fault diy at drax in 2016 a team of engineers at drax embarked on a project to construct a facility to rewind the stator on site this required crosscompany collaborative working to design and construct this huge purpose built facility contamination can cause operational problems so the team built a sterile white room within the turbine hall  one of just two places within the power station with foundations strong enough to support the incredible 450 tonnes required for the rewind facility designed to hold the stator core and the conductor bars air is forced out of the room to limit the possibility of contamination to the core during the rewind when the unit is in service it becomes magnetic so any metallic particles left in the space will be attracted to the core explains drax electrical engineer thomas walker once magnetised any metal particles could be drawn in burrowing into the insulation and core lamination this is the kind of event that an electricity generator wants to avoid  but when it happens be prepared to fix it roll with it when draxs stators were manufactured in the 1980s completing their construction relied on manual handling techniques modern day facilities however rotate the core to minimise human contact it took just six months for a partnership involving drax siemens and enser to manufacture what could be the largest stator rollers in the world and within that time ship them from the us to north yorkshire with the rollers installed the next step was to move in the core two of the turbine halls cranes each capable of lifting 150 tonnes were combined to lift it hoisting the core onto the mechanical roller within the rewind facility once in place the roller rotates the core allowing for the copper conductor bars to be safely removed and inserted despite this mechanical help the removing and replacing of each one is still at its heart a human job we still need 10 men to physically move the conductor bars with lifting aids which makes it not an easy process says walker using this method the bars weighing 200kg each can be safely and precisely fitted into the core opting for inhouse rewinding a stator is a complex process however when the time logistics and costs of shipping the core to siemens  the germanbased manufacturers  was factored in the decision to do the work at drax power station was an easy one  a 300tonne core is not easy to transport and the highways agency do not like things like that on the roads theyd want us to use waterways says drax lead engineer mark rowbottom logistically it just wasnt worth it its too much money to move and ship that weight to germany so we looked at what we could do onsite more than just an economical and logistical decision and with the uks diminishing manufacturing facilities drax is now equipped to support generator rewinds for many years to come building and operating the rewind facility was a project that leveraged the engineering abilities of drax employees they are increasingly doing engineering traditionally outsourced to equipment manufacturers the experience we have gained and the close working relationship we have established with siemens enables us to support the generator for the remaining life of the station says rowbottom to see the core in that many pieces and stripped down to this level is very rare says walker who began working at the plant as an apprentice  of the 84 conductor bars half have been fitted and the team is scheduled to complete the stator rewind in early 2018 i never thought id do anything like this but am proud to say that ive done it share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways
