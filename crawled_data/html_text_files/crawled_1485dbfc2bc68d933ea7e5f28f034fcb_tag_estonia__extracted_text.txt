estonia estonia catchment area analysis 17 march 2020 sustainable bioenergy estonia is a heavily forested country with a mature forest resource that has been neglected over many years due to political and ownership changes management of state and corporate owned forests is now good but some small privatelyowned areas of forest are still poorly managed despite this both the forest area and the growing stock have been increasing largely due to new planting and the maturing age class of existing forest forest area has increased from 49 to 52 of the total land increasing by more than 118 thousand hectares since 2010 land use in estonia click to viewdownload over the same period the growing stock increased by 52 million m 3  with 60 of this growth in softwood and 40 in hardwood species the data shows a slight decline in 2018 but this is due to a sampling error and the growing stock is thought to have been maintained at 2017 levels this should be rectified in the 2019 data when available change in forest growing stock  estonia click to viewdownload the forests of estonia have been going through a period of restitution since the 1990s land that had been taken into state ownership during soviet rule has been given back to private owners this process was complex and lengthy and limited active management in the forest during this time since 2008 harvesting and management has increased private and corporate forest owners have been harvesting forest that had been mature and ready for clear felling the longerterm harvesting trend has been considerably lower than annual growth increment and the maximum sustainable harvesting level as shown on the chart below annual increment and harvesting levels click to viewdownload in 2018 harvesting reached an all time high at just over 14 million m 3 and just under the maximum threshold it is expected to remain at this level as more forest matures and enters the cycle of harvest and regeneration harvesting type by volume click to viewdownload harvesting type by area click to viewdownload clear cutting regeneration felling is the largest operation by volume but thinning maintenance felling is the largest by area this indicates a forest landscape in balance with widespread thinning to produce more sawlog trees and a large volume of clear cuts in the mature stands to make way for the next generation of forests reforestation in estonia  note since 2014 it has not been compulsory for private and other forest owners to submit reforestation data click to viewdownload planting of seedlings is the most common form of regeneration however some native hardwood species are strong pioneers and naturally regenerate among the spruce and pine stands this has led to a change in the species composition of some forests with an increase in hardwoods although this is relatively small scale and only prevalent among some small private owners that do not invest in clearing unwanted regeneration species mix in estonian forests click to viewdownload markets and prices for forest products sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia pulpwood markets are limited in estonia and this material has been historically exported to neighbouring finland and sweden export demand has had a significant impact on prices as can be seen in a spike in 2018 when demand was at its strongest the forest industry has been dominated by sawmills and panel board mills demand and production in this sector has been increasing and this has kept prices high there is a substantial differential between sawlog and pulpwood pricing comparison of sawlog and pulpwood prices click to viewdownload the pellet industry developed due to the abundance of lowgrade fibre available domestically  this included sawmill and forest residues as well as low grade roundwood from thinnings and clear cuts draxs suppliers use a combination of these feedstock sources as shown below drax feedstocks from estonia 2018 click to view download sunrise through forest in estonia summary of key questions addressed in the analysis  impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest resources forest area  forest cover no negative impact regardless of increasing domestic biomass utilisation for energy and exports forest area has increased due to afforestation programmes forest cover is not as high as forest area due to temporarily unstocked area after clearcut despite this forest cover has continuously increased from 20102018 growing stock no negative impact the total forest growing stock has been increasing for the last two decades in 2018 the growth slowed or halted official statistics show a decrease but this is due to sampling error in 2018 there was recordhigh wood demand from finland which was driven by high global pulp prices motivating maximal pulp production this increased harvests to a previously unseen level harvesting levels slight increasing impact during 20042011 harvesting levels in estonia were less than half of the estimated maximum sustainable level this resulted in an increase in the maximum sustainable harvesting level for the 20112020 period in 2018 the harvesting volumes were at the maximum sustainable level the main drivers increasing the harvesting volumes have been increased sawmill capacity and production high demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden and improved demand for energy wood this was a temporary peak and demand has already slowed softwood lumber prices have decreased significantly in europe due to an abundance of wood supply from central europe which has been created by widespread bark beetle and other forest damages global pulp prices have also decreased to below 2017 prices forest growth  carbon sequestration potential ambivalent impact the annual increment has grown throughout the 20002018 period increased fuelwood price has enabled forest management in some of the alder forests that were completely unutilised in the past thinnings both commercial and precommercial accelerate longterm volume growth in forests leading to increased carbon sequestration removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels utilisation of sawmill byproducts does not directly impact forests carbon sequestration potential but it can increase harvesting through improved sawmill overall profitability impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest management practices rotation lengths neutral forest law regulates minimum forest age for clearcuts according to interviews riigimetsa majandamise keskus rmk  the estonian state forest company often conducts the final felling at the minimum age due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations at least in statemanaged forests in forests that are older than the minimum final felling age sawlog price is a more important driver for finalfelling decisions than woodbased bioenergy demand thinning increasing impact the increase of bioenergy demand has increased the demand for smalldiameter hardwood which in turn has increased thinnings in previously unmanaged forest stands this will increase the availability of good quality sawlogs and will also accelerate the carbon sequestration tonneshayear of the forests however the total forest carbon stock tonnesha will be reduced in unmanaged eg no thinnings mature stands the carbon stock is larger than in managed stands of similar age the carbon stock of a thinned stand will remain below that of an unthinned stand regardless of postthinning accelerated growth conversion from hardwood to softwood neutral no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to solid wood product swp markets diversion from other wood product markets neutral production of sawnwood woodbased panels pulp and paper products have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion wood prices slight increasing impact during 20172018 the price of all roundwood assortments increased notably the increase was strongest in pulpwood assortments especially those that are not further processed domestically but are exported to mainly finland and sweden finnish demand for pulpwood was at a very high level in 2018 this was a temporary trend however and prices and demand have since decreased the price increase for fuelwood was less dramatic no sharp increases are observed according to interviews pellet production was the most important driver of fuelwood prices read the full report catchment area analysis in estonia  a 2017 interview with raul kirjanen ceo of graanul invest a wood pellet supplier of drax operating in
