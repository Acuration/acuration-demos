drax power station to use its coal two other recentlybuilt coal power stations ferrybridge c and eggborough begin generating electricity 1974 drax power station begins generating electricity after its first 660mw unit is commissioned it is the most advanced and efficient coalfired power station ever built in the uk 1975 drax power station is officially opened with three generators and a total electrical capacity of just under 2 gigawatts gw it has the capability to power around two million homes 1986 drax doubles in size and capacity to just under 4 gw becoming the largest power station in the uk 1988 drax becomes the first power station to invest in retrofitted flue gas desulphurisation fgd equipment once fully operational in 1995 it removes 90 of sulphur dioxide emissions making it the cleanest coalfired power station in the uk 1990 drax power station comes under the ownership of national power one of three power generation companies created as part of the privatisation of the electricity industry in england and wales 1999 the power station is acquired by the usbased aes corporation for 187 billion turbine hall drax power station 2003 aes and drax part ways after one of the power stations major customers goes into administration as creditors various financial institutions take control of drax power station 2005 drax power station undergoes refinancing and drax group plc is listed on the london stock exchange 2008 boostedoverfireair bofa technology is retrofitted to all boilers and emissions of nitrous oxide no x  are reduced ensuring drax power station is compliant with a strengthened large combustion plant directive lcpd 2009 drax group acquires haven power  enabling the group to supply a proportion of the electricity it generates directly to businesses and organisations the engineering team at drax overcomes final challenges to successfully adapt boilers to combust wood pellets proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels to power one boiler can work how to switch a power station off coal read more 2012 drax power station completes a fiveyear 100 million plus project  the largest steam turbine modernisation programme in uk history  to upgrade its high and lowpressure turbines this saves around one million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to taking 275000 cars off the uks roads drax commits to transforming the business into a mainly biomassfuelled generator using compressed wood pellets in place of coal it plans to upgrade the three generating units that came online in the early 1970s to run on 100 sustainable biomass with no use of coal 2013 the first of three power generating units is successfully upgraded to use compressed wood pellets in april in december new biomass receipt storage and distribution systems to support the move from fossil fuels to renewables are officially opened the new rail unloading bay rub 2 receives the first stateoftheart biomass wagons  2014 the second power generating unit is upgraded to biomass in october additionally drax completes construction of four large storage domes used to house the biomass supply each dome is bigger than the royal albert hall can hold 75000 tonnes of highdensity wood pellets and is explosion proof 2015 drax biomass completes construction of two new pellet manufacturing facilities in mississippi and louisiana it also opens its port facility on the mississippi river in greater baton rouge work is undertaken to partially upgrade a third coal unit to run on compressed wood pellets drax awaits european commission approval for the full conversion draxs fourth uk port facility begins biomass deliveries to the power station a first phase of the 100m development is launched by peel ports in liverpool and drax becomes the first company to transport regular rail freight over the pennines for nearly 35 years building a 21st century port read more 2016 the group announces that 70 of the electricity it generates is through compressed wood pellets  around 20 of the uks renewable power only 30 of its electricity is coalfired 2017 drax acquires opus energy  the uks largest nondomestic energy supplier outside of the big 6
