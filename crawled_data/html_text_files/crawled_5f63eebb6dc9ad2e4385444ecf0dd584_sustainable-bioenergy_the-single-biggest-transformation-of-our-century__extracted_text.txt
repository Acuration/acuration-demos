power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station the single biggest transformation of our century how the biggest power station in the uk became europes largest decarbonisation project 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy at the turn of the millennium drax was facing a serious issue demand for electricity was high and increasing but so was the desire for sources of power that were less harmful to the environment than coal at that time draxs fuel to continue to meet demand in a cleaner and more sustainable way an alternative approach was needed drax had a legacy in this field  in 1988 it was the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions in the two decades that followed however the sustainability conversation moved beyond how to make coal cleaner instead the focus was finding a truly viable alternative fuel finding a new fuel in those early days the idea of converting a fully coalfired station to another fuel seemed outlandish to say the least we made a lot of peoples heads hurt with this project says drax strategic projects engineering manager jason shipstone no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going back then it was all about experimentation jim price alternative fuel manager at the time explains initially we found a few distressed cargos of wood pellets and sunflower husks that someone had ordered but didnt want we mixed that with coal at very low concentration price and his team found they could use the plantbased fuel alongside coal at low percentages without it detrimentally affecting the boilers it was a long way from being a new business model but it was a start they spent the next year working with willow wood a subsidized energy crop that proved difficult to turn into a fuel that could be used efficiently to power a boiler then in 2005 after building a prototype plant and finding a way to pulverise the willow into a fine powder  called wood flour  and combine it with coal dust the team hit its first key milestone it was able to power a drax boiler that was the eureka moment says price no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going a change in attitude the response to the success was immediate senior management support for the project had been in place from the beginning but now there was a change across the whole company people started to think maybe it can be done says price work continued on the project and  after more experiments  drax eventually settled on compressed wood pellets this form of biomass ultimately required investment in four vast storage domes that between them store 80000 tonnes of pellets then there was the issue of supply and delivery materials were sourced from the us shipped to the uk then freighted to the plant in specially designed covered train wagons each carrying up to 7600 tonnes everything else had to carry on as normal this had to be seamless we had to work the same as drax has always worked  reliable and available says shipstone jason shipstone drax strategic projects manager played an instrumental role in upgrading drax the final hurdle in 2009 the team overcame one of the final challenges and successfully adapted the boilers to combust the new fuel proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels powering one boiler  in this case wood pellets and coal could work it was enough to show there was a future in wood pellets and it could work at scale although nothing was fully built yet but dorothy thompson ceo of drax was convinced shipstone remembers the conversation after thompson signed the contract to begin the transition in earnest so we can do 10 what does it take to get to 50 she asked recalls shipstone his response no problem it was the right answer he says toward a coalfree future fast forward to 2016 and drax is europes largest decarbonisation project  reducing emissions by at least 80 of the 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that the three now converted former coal generation units would have released per year although only half of draxs six units have been upgraded from coal to use compressed wood pellets  65 of the electricity generated at the power station is the result of a renewable rather than a fossil fuel its three biomass units produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes  or more than half of all residential properties in northern england given the challenges the world faces regarding the future of energy production decisive action is required if were to meet carbon reduction targets in the uk the government has voiced ambitions of phasing out coal by 2025 drax has aims of doing it quicker thompson has spoken of plans that see all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before the story of energy since the dawn of the industrial revolution has been one of fossil fuels this simply has to change by finding a way to ease the transition away from coal drax is helping to write the next chapter share related stories press releases on pawtrol
