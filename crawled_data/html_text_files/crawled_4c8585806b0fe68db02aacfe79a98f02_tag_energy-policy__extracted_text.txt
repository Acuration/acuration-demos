energy policy how to build a business model for negative emissions 10 may 2021 carbon capture in brief policy intervention is needed to enable enough beccs in power to make a net zero uk economy possible by 2050 early investment in beccs can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s a twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver beccs and other net zero technologies in the time frame needed go deeper explore the frontier

communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of

consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not

zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in

international actions to build on these and continue uk leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation we call on the uk to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of cop26 to match the commitment of the us presidentelects clean energy plan  to ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input alongside nearterm stability as the uks carbon pricing future is determined to meet this commitment government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the budget next year with a

a key talking point so too will progress towards not just the paris agreement goals but those of individual countries known as national determined contributions ndcs these sit under the umbrella of the paris agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries with many countries still reeling from the effects of covid19 the question is which countries are actually on track to meet them what are the goals the ndcs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change these incorporate various targets from decarbonisation and forestry to coastal preservation and financial aims while all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the paris agreement targets not all have an equally sized task the principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions capabilities and economic conditions the universal ecological fund outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters showing that combined they account for 56 of global greenhouse gas emissions china is the largest emitter responsible for 268 followed by the us which contributes

the course of chinas emissions some projections show that emissions are likely to grow in the short term before peaking and levelling out sometime between 2021 and 2025 however according to the

estimates will be achieved in fact the eu is on track to cut emissions by 58 by 2030 this progress is in part a result of a large package of measures adopted in 2018 these accelerated the emissions reductions including national coal phaseout plans increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency the package also introduced legally binding annual emission limits for each member state within which they can set individual targets to meet the common goal the uk has not yet released an updated independent ndc however it has announced a 350 million package designed to cut emissions in heavy

august 2020 opinion reduced demand boosted renewables and the neartotal abandonment of coal pushed last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions technologies such as beccs  bioenergy with carbon capture

ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint track our progress at towards carbon negative   in this article weve simplified our explanation of net zero carbon dioxide co 2  is the most abundant greenhouse gas ghg it is also a longlived ghg that creates warming that persists in the long term although the land and ocean absorb it a significant proportion stays in the atmosphere for centuries or even millennia causing climate change it is therefore the most important ghg to abate other longlived ghgs include include nitrous oxide n 2 o lifetime of circa 120 years and some fgasses eg sf 6 with a lifetime of circa 3200 years ghgs are often aggregated as carbon dioxide equivalent abbreviated as co 2 e or co 2 eq and it is this that net zero targets measure in this article carbon is used for simplicity and as a proxy for carbon dioxide co 2  ghgs or

change is the biggest challenge of our time will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags about us  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass energy  careers  decarbonisation  energy policy  gas  investors  sustainability whats next for bioenergy 11 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power today when we talk about electricity we talk about climate change about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies theyre all inexplicably linked and all hold uncertainties for the future but in preparing for whats to come it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us researchers at universities across the uk including the university of manchester and imperial college london have put their heads together to think about this question and together with the supergen bioenergy programme theyve created a unique graphic novel on bioenergy that outlines three potential future scenarios based on their imagined views of the future theres plenty to be optimistic about but it could just as easily go south future one failure to act on climate change in the first scenario our energy use and reliance on nonrenewable fuels like oil coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while its affordable neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends  energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption in response electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up which leads to several problems attempts to secure a dwindling stock of nonrenewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security as resources run out attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years the damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive future two growing a stable centralised bioenergy a future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isnt the only way forward bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future in fact nearly all scenarios where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees celsius margin recommended by the paris agreement rely on widespread bioenergy use with carbon capture and storage beccs but how far could the implementation of bioenergy go a second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major centralised features in global energy networks this limits the effects of a warming climate particularly as ccs technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground this has knockon effects for the rest of the world large tracts of land are turned over to forestry to support the need for biomass creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests in industry largescale ccs systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further future 3 the right mix bioenergy a third scenario takes a combined approach  one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of beccs energy renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives this relies on the advance of a few key technologies widespread adoption of advanced battery technology sees wind and solar implemented at scale  providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities these communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common whether future three  or any of the above scenarios  will unfold like this is uncertain these are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is its up to us all  not just governments but businesses individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too  to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want tags climate change  energy policy  investors  technology 1 2  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to receive a regular roundup of
