power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station when would you need a battery the size of a mountain how pumped storage hydro power stations use gravity to deliver electricity when its needed 11 march 2019 power generation whats the biggest battery you can think of a car battery a gridscale lithiumion array what about a battery the size of a mountain thats what youll find on the banks of loch awe in argyll scotland cruachan power station is a pumped hydro storage facility comprised of nearly 20 km of tunnels and chambers cutting through the mountain of ben cruachan built in the 1960s the site known as the hollow mountain entails a subterranean power station a reservoir a dam and the loch itself these components all work together to store a huge amount of energy or enough to power more than 880000 homes at a moments notice this probably doesnt fit your image of what a battery looks like but the principle is the same the purpose of any battery from the aas in your remote control to the one in your phone that you charge every night is to store power for future use in an aa battery that storage takes the form of chemicals within the battery which release electricity under the right conditions in pumped hydro the purpose is the same but instead of being stored in chemicals that energy is stored in the gravitational potential energy of 10 million cubic meters of water sitting poised to spin cruachans turbines and generate 440 megawatts mw of electricity such a huge amount of water is the equivalent of around seven gigawatthours gwh of energy if the reservoir is full the hollow mountain can power a city for more than 15 hours how pumped hydro works cruachan power station is one of only four such storage facilities in the uk inside the mountain 396 metres beneath the surface is a chamber about the size of a football pitch and the height of a sevenstorey building here sit four electricitygenerating turbines each weighing around 650 tonnes a series of tunnels and channels connect these turbines to two enormous bodies of a water loch awe at the base and the ben cruachan reservoir further up the mountain the turbines can function both as pumps and as generators when there is an excess of power on the grid and electricity is cheap the turbines consume electricity and work to pump water up from the loch below to the reservoir 300 metres above then when electricity demand rises the turbines reverse direction now the water flows down from the reservoir and through the turbines which switch to generating electricity and supply it to the grid this is an extremely quick process unlike coal or nuclear stations which can take hours to get up to full capacity cruachan can go from standstill to generating within two minutes  perfect for reacting to variance in grid demand at short notice httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 often national grid eso electricity system operator keeps one or more of cruachans four units spinning in air compressed air is used to evacuate water from around a turbine to allow it to spin when necessary it can go from zero megawatts to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds in any given day the system operator may call on cruachan power station multiple times as the requirements to manage the grid constantly change cruachan is a net generator of power across the year thanks to the large amount of water flowing into its reservoir from a system of aqueducts however pumped hydro is primarily about storing energy  not actively producing it in the way wind solar gas biomass or conventional hydropower facilities might in fact the uks four pumped hydro power stations are a combined net consumer of electricity but this is the case with regular batteries as well when construction is factored in nevertheless pumped hydro storage is still efficient  around 70 to 80 of the electricity used in pumping is recovered in generation sometimes the convenience of getting access to power when its needed is more valuable than how much power is conserved the need for storage but why store so much energy in such an improbable location to begin with there are two key reasons the first is that the grid doesnt operate under the same conditions all the time great britain will use more or less electricity owing to its needs for example overnight there is a lower demand than at 5pm on a weekday evening this means sometimes the grid is demanding more electricity than is being supplied and sometimes vice versa secondly theres the increasing level of intermittent energy sources like wind and solar supplying low carbon electricity these sources are highly dependent on the weather and cant be easily turned up or down in response to grid conditions batteries can address these two issues in times of higher electricity supply than demand storage systems can absorb and store electricity from the grid which helps balance frequency and prevent surges and in times of high demand then can quickly deliver electricity where its needed pumped hydro is an important part of this equation  in fact while other types of gridscale batteries are receiving significant investment they are still in their infancy pumped storage by contrast already accounts for 95 of all installed storage capacity in the world around 130 gw what does the future hold for pumped hydro one of the challenges in installing more pumped hydro storage is finding suitable geography  places which are both mountainous with nearby suitably large bodies of water however there have been experiments into river and tidalbased pumped hydro storage projects senator wash dam on the colorado river uses pumping to store water upstream from the imperial hydropower dam so it can be released when needed while the rance tidal power station in france pumps sea water behind the barrage to allow it to start up faster storage solutions will become more important as electricity systems increasingly move towards renewable and low carbon sources pumped storage helps to meet peaktime demand and provide grid stability by making use of the landscape and gravity to
