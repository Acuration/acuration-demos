transport contact us morehouse catchment area analysis the drax forestry team assesses report illustrating that our north louisiana pellet plant sits in a wellestablished working forest landscape dominated by sawtimber and pulp  paper markets 28 january 2020 sustainable bioenergy the forest area around the drax morehouse bioenergy plant has a long history of active management for timber production 96 of the forest owners are private and around half of these are corporate investors seeking a financial return from forest management  the pulp and paper pp sector dominates the market for low grade roundwood with over 75 of the total demand the wood pellet markets use only 6 of the roundwood of which 4 is used by morehouse given the small scale of demand in the pellet sector the extent of influence is limited however the new pellet markets have had a positive impact replacing some of the declining demand in the pp sector and providing a market for thinnings for some forest owners and a new offtake for sawmill residues pine forest is dominant in this area with an increasing inventory growing stock despite a stable forest area active management of pine forests has increased the amount of timber stored in the standing trees by 68 million tonnes from 2006 to 2018 over the same period the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required to utilise this surplus volume and ensure that the longterm future of the forest area can be maintained historic pine inventory by dbh class in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload this is reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class of the forest resource and the increasing quantity of timber available for harvesting

the financial crisis in 2008 it also shows the recent increase in pulpwood demand driven by the new pellet mill markets that have supplemented the declining pp mills historic pine roundwood removals

with most private owners seeking to maximise revenue through sawtimber production from pine forests as detailed in the table below there are 70 markets for higher value timber products around this catchment area these mills also need an offtaker for their residues and the pellet mills can provide a valuable market for this material increasing the viability of the sawtimber market operating

including morehouse bioenergy have had on the significant trends in the local forest industry the tables below summarise the forisk view on the key issues in its opinion the morehouse plant has had no negative impact bioenergy impacts on markets and forest supplies in the morehouse market activity is there evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following explanation deforestation no change in forest management practice no diversion from other markets possibly bioenergy plants compete with pulppaper and osb mills for pulpwood and residual feedstocks there is no evidence that these facilities reduced production as a result of bioenergy markets however increase in wood price no there is no evidence that bioenergy demand increased stumpage prices in the market reduction in growing stocking timber no reduction in sequestration of carbon  growth rate no increasing harvesting above the sustainable yield no bioenergy impacts on forests markets in the morehouse market forest metric
