and economics he is a senior lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy with fifteen years experience in energy rd iain is codeveloper of the renewablesninja  an open web platform that lets you simulate the hourly power output from wind and solar power plants located anywhere in the world iain also leads the electric insights project an interactive website and quarterly report on the supply demand price and environmental impacts of britains electricity he is one of the founders of power swarm  a network of 400 academics industry and government experts working on power system transformation iains research centres on decarbonising electricity systems ranging from the economics of battery storage and productivity of offshore wind farms to efficient ways of integrating renewables into electricity markets broad research areas include the potential of an interconnected supergrid and smart energy storage systems to reduce the cost and carbon emissions of generating electricity across europe the impacts that climate change will have on the business case for renewables the role of flexible fossil power in balancing decarbonised energy systems and residentialscale microgeneration for decarbonising the heat sector as energy renewables and carbon are never far from the public eye iains resarch and commentary have appeared in the bbc 2
