great to have further clarity from the government about the future for coal and we look forward to working with them and helping to achieve this goal of making the power sector coal free in 2025 as weve said before coal doesnt have a long term role to play in a low carbon future weve already seen a dramatic fall in power generation from coal  an 84 reduction in the last five years and a major shift towards lower carbon technologies at drax were exploring options for repowering our remaining coal units to use sustainable biomass and gas local people to be consulted on plans for gasfired power station 2 january 2018 press releases the proposed open cycle gas turbine ocgt power station would produce up to 299 mw of electricity enough to power the equivalent of about 150000 homes it is intended to be able to be up and running quickly to provide backup power to the national grid during periods of peak demand to support the growing number of renewable and low carbon energy sources as a rapid response and flexible power station it would not be operational all the time  it would be producing power for up to a maximum of 2250 hours in a given year the development will contribute millions of pounds of investment into the local economy create up to 15 full time skilled jobs once operational and up to 150 jobs during the twoyear construction period local people were originally consulted on proposals for the power station in 2014 but the project was put on hold in 2015 due to market uncertainty the project is now under the new ownership of the british energy company drax group plc and is once again being taken forward andy koss drax power ceo said as a result of what was learned during the consultation undertaken in 2014 and other studies we have made a number of changes to the original proposals for example the cable for the electrical connection has been put underground instead of having an overhead line we have selected an access route from the b4489 to the west of the site and reduced the number of stacks from five to one we are looking forward to sharing our latest plans at the public exhibitions next month and hearing what local people think about them before we finalise the scheme and submit a development consent order application abergelli power limited is holding public consultation events from 7 february 2018 to 10 february 2018 at
