archives press release more than 50 of britains electricity now low carbon according to groundbreaking new report 14 november 2016 uncategorized lowcarbon sources of energy  such as nuclear hydro biomass wind and solar  now contribute twice as much electricity than they did in 2010 20 carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at a record low  down a third over a 12month period and 56 over four years britain now has 26gw of wind and solar installed  a sixfold increase over the last six years while biomass has increased from nothing to 2gw of generating capacity carbon price floor plays a big role in reducing coals contribution which was just 3 of the uks electricity last quarter  down from 38 during the same period in 2012 last quarter for the first time ever more than half 502 of britains electricity was produced from lowcarbon energy sources according to a new quarterly research report released today authored by researchers from imperial college london in collaboration with drax between july and september 2016 the contribution of nuclear biomass hydro wind solar and lowcarbon electricity imports from france peaked at 502 up from just 20 in 2010  demonstrating the scale and impact of britains renewable energy revolution over the last six years and the unprecedented changes taking place in the uk energy sector launched today the drax electric insights report is designed to shed light on the dramatic impact of these changes which include the governments commitment to shift away from coal by 2025 obligations to decarbonise policy levers including the carbon price floor commitments to new nuclear and prices reaching new highs and new lows using consolidated data produced by national grid and elexon who run the electricity network and balancing market respectively it will focus quarter by quarter on data charting supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the networks that connect them  providing new empirical evidence to contribute to the uk energy debate according to this quarters report nuclear energy provided the largest share of lowcarbon energy over the last three months generating over a quarter of the uks electricity 26 followed by onshore and offshore wind 10 solar 5 biomass 4 lowcarbon energy imports from france 4 and hydro 1the data also revealed that britain now has 26gw of solar and wind installed a sixfold increase since 2010 while biomass has increased from nothing to 2gw of power generation over the same period crucially the findings also reveal the sharp decline in coal which has been largely due to the increases to the carbon price floor which took effect last year just 3 of britains electricity last quarter was generated from this fossil fuel  down from over a third 38 during the same period in 2012  placing it below wind solar and biomass in the uk energy generation league tables for the very first time in fact for almost six full days last quarter the uk was completely coal free  the first instance britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity since 1881 as the report points out a quarter of britains coal stations have shut down over the last 12months in the last quarter alone coal utilisation fell to its lowest ever levels  with plants producing just 7 of their maximum capacity  less than half the productivity of britains solar panels over the quarter according to the research this move away from dispatchable fossil fuels like coal towards weather dependent renewable while slashing emissions is also forcing the uk power system into new challenging territories last quarter at its minimum only 47 gw of electricity was generated from flexible dispatchable power plants meaning they had less breathing space for times of low demand and high renewables output in contrast prior to 2013 this minimum level had never previously fallen beneath 10gw the report also found that volatile power prices are likely to be the new normal in the uk with last quarter witnessing the highest energy prices for several years and an alltime low zero or negative power prices  when high inflexible power generation meets low demand  occurred 45 times over the last quarter twice as many as during the whole of 2015 combined at the same time this quarter also saw the highest peak energy price for three years on thursday 15th september when prices reached 802mwh drax power ceo andy koss said this report shows britains energy system is changing dramatically and we are seeing real benefits cleaner energy has reached a record high and carbon emissions from electricity hit a record low we can also see the crucial role that policy levers like the carbon price floor play but there is more to do to make britain truly low carbon additional reliable affordable clean energy is needed on the system along with a focus of getting the balance right more intermittent renewables like wind and solar are crucial but they will require more flexible back up like biomass to provide homes and business with electricity on demand dr iain staffell of imperials centre for environmental policy said you cannot manage what you cannot measure although there is a huge amount of data available on our electricity system before now there was no way to put it all together to see the big picture of what is happening and more importantly why my work with drax provided an opportunity to apply my research to cut through the noise and understand britains electricity is changing for the better we are so used to badnews stories about the environment so it is good to see that for once concrete progress is being made the first edition of the report also found that carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at a record low  down a third over a 12month period and 56 over four years  thanks to the rise of clean energy and the switch from coal to gas three quarters 76 of the uks electricity consumption emissions are now produced from burning gas  with 14 from produced burning coal  a role reversal from 2012 when coal accounted for 76 and gas 22 of these emissions respectively the last 12 months saw 32 gw of new wind and solar farms come online  while a quarter of the countrys coal capacity came off grid electric insights will be published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  wwwelectricinsightscouk

billion towards uk gdp in 2015 and supported thousands of jobs across the country the findings were revealed in a new report looking at the groups uk operations which includes drax power station  europes largest decarbonisation project researchers at oxford economics studied the impact of drax group on the uks economy as the company nears completion of a major high tech engineering and infrastructure project to upgrade half the generating units at drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass in place of coal with the right support from government drax aims to upgrade the remainder of the power station their report estimates that the groups uk activities and that of companies in its supply chain last year contributed 12 billion to the economy and supported 14150 jobs  employment covered a wide range of sectors including highskilled manufacturing of industrial components engineering and technical machinery construction it professional business services and transport this combination of activity and employment also generated tax revenues for the uk estimated at 430 million equivalent to the salaries of almost 16500 nurses or 12900 teachers oxford economics used three measures to calculate drax groups gdp contribution the direct activities of the group and its contractors activity and employment in the supply chain of the group and its contractors and spending by all employees involved a breakdown of the gdp generated by drax group shows all regions of the uk benefited highlights include 493 million created in draxs heartland of yorkshire and the humber  1100 jobs for the north east and 82m contributed to the local economy 191 million generated in the east of england  where the groups retail arm haven power is based 1700 jobs supported in scotland and 120 million generated in its economy 550 jobs sustained and 42 million contributed to gdp in the south west  the report also analysed the economic impact of upgrading drax to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal it reveals this project has thus far generated 710 million in gdp throughout the uk economy and supported 11400 jobs half of these in construction manufacturing and transport drax group ceo dorothy thompson said this report shows drax is supporting more than 14000 jobs across the uk with the vast majority resulting from our upgrades to biomass technology the economic benefit has reached all parts of the country we have been the catalyst for rejuvenation and growth across the northern powerhouse with port expansion on the coasts of east yorkshire the north west and north east drax is now the uks biggest single generator of renewable power with the right support from government we aim to upgrade more of our electricity production to using compressed wood pellets this would provide a further boost to the uk economy and deliver increased carbon savings sam moore managing director of consultancy at oxford economics said drax group makes an important economic contribution to yorkshire and the humber and the uk more widely its activities generated over 1 billion in gdp last year and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation in addition ambitious investments by the group and its partners in regional biomass infrastructure have driven huge demand and supported many more thousands of jobs the drax upgrades to use biomass in place of coal are also environmentally and strategically very significant in the context of the wider challenges for the uks energy system ends full details of the study can be found at draximpactcouk

millionth tonne of carbon through use of sustainable biomass 17 june 2016 uncategorized drax the uks largest power station  providing 7 to 8 of the uks power needs  will in july save its 20 millionth tonne of carbon since it started burning sustainable biomass in place of coal some 10 years ago it expects to take only a further two and a half years to reach the 50 million tonne mark this latest recorded carbon saving reinforces its position as europes largest decarbonisation project and the uks largest generator of renewable electricity from a single site¹ drax has already converted two generating units and with a third in the pipeline drax will reduce its annual carbon emissions by around 12 million tonnes a year this is equivalent to taking 33 million cars off the uks roads or making the uks entire industrial and manufacturing sector zero carbon²  with sustainable biomass providing a carbon saving of approximately 86 per cent compared to coalfired generation dorothy thompson chief executive of drax group plc said this latest milestone data underscores the low carbon credentials of sustainable biomass in a relatively short period of time drax has delivered major carbon savings while continuing to provide reliable secure and good value renewable power this data also gives an indication of the scale of the contribution sustainable biomass will make to meeting the uks carbon reduction targets drax is already europes largest decarbonisation project and we believe that there is potential for significant additional carbon savings through the conversion of further units ends references in 2014 the uk generated a total of 644twh of renewable electricity department of energy and climate change energy trends quarterly and monthly data  renewables source  drax generated 79twh of electricity from its two units converted to burn sustainable biomass accounting for 123 per cent of the uks total renewable electricity generation in 2014 the uks industrial processes and manufacturing sector is estimated to have emitted 12 million tonnes of co2 department of energy and climate change 2014 uk greenhouse emissions provisional figures source notes drax is the uks largest power station typically meeting 78 of the uks power needs it is europes largest decarbonisation project and the uks largest renewable electricity generator biomass is organic material obtained from living or recently living plant matter that can be burnt to produce energy the materials that drax uses include low grade wood such as forest thinnings tree tops and branches as well as sawmill residues and to a lesser extent residual agricultural products such as straw sunflower seed husks and peanut husks and purpose grown energy crops drax sources the majority of its biomass from the south eastern us but also from canada and to a lesser extent other eu member states where forest areas are growing not declining owing to experienced and professional sustainable forest management the main drivers of commercial forestry practices are industries such as the furniture and construction sectors which use the main part of the tree for lumber drax then uses the material leftover such as the thinnings tree tops limbs and other low grade wood further information on the types of biomass fibre drax uses and which countries it comes from can be found in draxs biomass supply report 2014

given for reform of energy generation auctions 16 february 2016 uncategorized an independent report published today has revealed consumers could save more than 2 billion if the governments planned renewable energy auctions are opened up to include a wider mix of technologies drax commissioned nera economic consulting and imperial college to look at hidden costs that are not reflected in the contracts government awards for renewable generation these hidden costs or whole system costs are increasing as intermittent renewables  those reliant on the sun and wind  increase these intermittent renewables mean other forms of power generation need to kick in and flex up and down to meet electricity demand these costs are passed on to consumers via their energy bills currently the government is planning three auctions for new renewable energy contracts  contracts for difference cfds  planned over the next four years and all are focused on offshore wind the new research shows significant differences in the true costs of renewables once these additional costs are recognised offshore wind could require a cfd of 127 per mwh onshore wind 9297 per mwh solar 96 per mwh and biomass 84 per mwh once these new support levels are modelled over the planned energy auctions the new energy mix that could win contracts is shown to save consumers 19 22 billion this support is already paid for through energy bills and the new costefficient mix would lessen the impact drax group ceo dorothy thompson said this independent research shows its crucial we get the right mix of energy generation the uks system faces growing challenges from costs to reliability as traditional forms of generation are replaced with renewables intermittent renewables like wind and solar are vital as we continue to clean up energy generation but they need to be backed up by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down to make sure the uks businesses and households always have power on demand opening up energy auctions to include other renewables could save consumers 2 billion and with more biomass in the mix energy security is also boosted using the latest technology weve upgraded half our power station to run on compressed wood pellets which give an 80 plus carbon saving against coal with the right support we stand ready to finish the job nera economic consulting associate director daniel radov added nera economic consulting is pleased to be able to continue its partnership with imperial college in modelling the total costs of different power generation technologies and in helping to inform the policy discussion around renewable energy and decarbonisation to ensure that we achieve environmental targets as efficiently as possible it is essential to have policies in place that provide the right incentives to minimise costs we hope the combination of imperials wholesystem energy modelling with neras ability to model the details of the cfd auctions will contribute

modelling would be consistent with the work they produced for the committee on climate change on the same topic in 2015 the report focuses on whole system costs whole system costs wsc are simply the sum of the levelised cost of energy and the associated system integration costs for a given technology ie wsc  lcoe  sic the levelised cost of energy lcoe is the cost of building maintaining and operating a generation asset ie power stationwind farmsolar park over the life of the asset this is the figure that is currently factored into cfd auction bids system integration costs sic represent the additional expense of operating the electricity network as a result of those assets participating in the gb electricity market these costs include maintaining sufficient levels of backup capacity system reliability and managing flows on the transmission network system balancing different technologies eg wind solar biomass etc have different impacts on total system integration costs depending on their reliability flexibility and location on the system the government has committed to support offshore wind capacity in the next three cfd auctions to promote technological learning and cost reduction in that technology this analysis proposes that a proportion of the offshore wind budget is protected in each auction to promote such benefits the analysis demonstrates that opening a proportion of the budget to full technology neutral competition could reduce costs to consumers by up to 22bn report click here to view the nera economic consulting report about drax drax group plc is
