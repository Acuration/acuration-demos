biomass energy 4 amazing uses of bioenergy 5 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy bioenergy is the worlds largest renewable energy source providing 10 of the worlds primary supply  but more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station and smaller power plants but this isnt the only way bioenergy is being used around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways powering selfsufficient robots what type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags sustainability  biomass energy  technology  investors sustainability certified 24 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy of all the changes to drax power station over the last decade perhaps the biggest is one you cant see since converting three of its six generating units from coal to run primarily on compressed wood pellets  drax has reduced those units greenhouse gas ghg emissions by over 80  and while this is a huge improvement it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isnt sustainably sourced  for this reason drax works with internationallyrecognised certification programmes that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental social and economic criteria thanks to these certification programmes drax can be confident it is not only reducing ghg emissions but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced sustainability certifications the compressed wood pellets used at drax power station come from various locations around the world so drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes the three main ones being the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council  fsc   1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc the programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management but adoption rates vary by region european landowners and regulators are most familiar with the fsc and national pefc standards while north american landowners generally prefer sfi and american tree farm system also members of the pefc family in instances in which drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications or in instances in which drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable over 50 of the pellets used at drax power station come from the southern usa  where sfi and american tree farm system are the most widely implemented certification programmes overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest however the sfi offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by woodprocuring entities such as sawmills pulp mills and pellet mills this programme is referred to as sfi fiber sourcing and to obtain it participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources these sources may or may not include certified forests the programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity water quality landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals together these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides drax with a significant proportion of its pellets and since the sfi and atfs programmes are endorsed by pefc north american suppliers have a pathway for their regions sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by european stakeholders these certification programmes have been in use for many years but with recent growth in the market for wood pellets a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass new kid on the block the sustainable biomass program sbp was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources but rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes it builds on them for example sbp recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes however the pefc sfi and fsc programmes do not include requirements for reporting ghg emissions a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to european regulators sbp fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets when a new entity such as a wood pellet manufacturer first seeks certification under sbp that entity is required to assess its supply base feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme sfi fsc   pefc or pefc approved schemes is considered sbpcompliant all other feedstock must be evaluated against sbp criteria and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 sbp indicators if during the process a specific risk is identified for example to the forest ecosystem the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded these assessments are audited by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee in conducting the risk assessment the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes sustainable energy for the uk counting major energy companies including dong energy eon and drax as members the sbp has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry at the end of 2016 the sbp had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries  including draxs pellet manufacturing arm drax biomass  in mississippi and louisiana its a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides drax with the assurance that it is powering the uk using biomass from legal and sustainable sources like the fastreducing carbon dioxide emissions of britains power generation sector  its a change you cant see but

sustainability  biomass energy more power per pound 23 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy as the country moves towards a lower carbon future each renewable power generation technology has its place wind solar hydro and wave can take advantage of the weather to provide plentiful power  when conditions are right reliable affordable renewable power but people need electricity instantly  not just when its a windy night or a sunny day so until a time when storage can provide enough affordable capacity to store and supply the grid with power from ample solar and wind farms the country has to rely in part on thermal generation like gas coal and biomass reliable and available on demand yes but renewable low carbon and affordable too it can be a year ago a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers at imperial college london highlighted how a balanced mix of renewable technologies could save bill payers more than 2bn  now publicly available ofgem data on which its newly published renewables obligation annual report 201516 is based reinforces the case for government to continue to support coaltobiomass unit conversions within that technology mix why because out of all renewables deployed at large scale biomass presents the most value for money  less public funding is required for more power produced renewable costs compared drax power stations biomass upgrades were the largest recipient of renewable obligation ro support during the period 201516 the transformation from coal to compressed wood pellets has made drax the largest generator of renewable electricity in the country and by a significant margin drax power station produced more than five times the renewable power than the next biggest project supported under the ro  the london array dr iain staffell lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy imperial college london and author of electric insights  who has analysed the ofgem data commented based on ofgems renewables obligation database the average support that drax power station received was 4305 per mwh generated this compares to 8870 per mwh from the other nine largest projects biomass receives half the support of the uks other large renewable projects which are all offshore wind the average support received across all renewable generators in the ro scheme  which includes much smaller projects and all types of technology  is 58 per mwh that is around 15 per mwh more than the support received by drax ending the age of coal drax group isnt arguing for limitless support for coaltobiomass conversions and drax power station being the biggest most modern and efficient of power stations built in the age of coal  is a special case but if the ro did exist just to support lots of biomass conversions like drax but no other renewable technologies then in just one year between 201516 1bn of costs saving could have been made for the public purse drax power station may be the biggestsingle site recipient of support under the ro  but it does supply more low carbon power into the national grid than any other company supported by renewable obligation certificates rocs in fact 65 of the electricity generated at its selby north yorkshire site is now renewable thats 16 of the entire countrys renewable power  enough to power four million households thanks to the support provided to drax by previous

covered by forests thats an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy to celebrate the uns international day of forests  were looking at some of the reasons why forests and wood fuel are more powerful than you might think theyre a major source of renewable energy nearly half of the worlds renewable energy comes from forests in the form of wood fuel roughly 24 billion people around the world use it for things like cooking heating and generating electricity in fact about 50 of the total global wood production is currently used for these purposes however it is critical that this resource is managed sustainably and responsibly  one of the key aims of the international day of forests is to encourage people to utilise their local forest resources sustainably to ensure it endures for future generations they can revitalise economies because wood fuel is such a widely used energy source it also supports a healthy vibrant industry roughly 900 million people work in the wood energy sector globally  more than that rural economies built on wood energy can be revitalised by modernisation which can then stimulate local business  investment can help finance better forest management which in turn leads to forest growth improvements in sustainability standards and in some cases increased employment they can help mitigate climate change the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the global annual primary energy consumption which makes it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand in a sustainable and renewable way when wood is used as fuel it releases carbon dioxide co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or sustainable system of growing forests this carbon is offset by new tree plantings the only emissions produced therefore are the ones involved in transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predict that by 2030 forestry mitigation with the help of carbon pricing could

biomass energy  gas a positive negative 18 january 2017 carbon capture this story was updated in june 2018 following the announcement of draxs pilot beccs project is there a way to generate electricity not only with no emissions but with negative emissions its an idea that after decades of being reliant on coal had seemed almost impossible but as drax has shown by announcing a pilot of the first bioenergy carbon capture storage beccs project of its kind in europe  it might not be impossible for much longer a few years on from the historic paris agreement  which sets a target of keeping global temperature rise below two degrees celsius  innovative solutions for reducing emissions are critical among these few are more promising than beccs it sounds like a straightforward solution  capture carbon emissions and lock them up hundreds of metres underground or turn the carbon into useful products  but the result could be gamechanging generating electricity with negative emissions capturing carbon carbon capture and storage ccs technology works by trapping the carbon dioxide co 2  emitted after a fuel source has been used and moving it to safe storage  often in depleted oil and gas reservoirs underground there are a number of ccs technologies available but one of the simplest is oxyfuel combustion fuel such as coal gas or biomass is burnt in a high oxygen environment and co 2  rather than carbon c or carbon monoxide co  is produced other impurities are removed and the resulting pure co 2 is compressed to form a liquid this co 2 can then be transported via pipeline to its designated storage space normally hundreds of metres underground the uk is wellplaced to benefit from the technology thanks to the north sea  which has enough space to store the eus carbon emissions for the next 100 years its a technology that can drastically reduce the emissions from fossil fuel use but how can it be used to produce negative emissions two technologies working as one biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured as part of its life in the forest is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report published by the energy technology institute eti looking at the uk has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year  approximately half the nations emissions target its not the only body heralding it as a necessary step for the future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated in a 2014 report that keeping global warming below two degrees celsius would be difficult if beccs had limited deployment support is widespread but for it to lead to a practical future beccs needs suitable support and investment mills such as morehouse bioenergy manufacture compressed wood pellets  a sustainablysourced fuel for beccs power plants of the future positive support for negative emissions there are only a handful of ccs projects in operation or under construction across the world and many simply reuse rather than capture the co 2  part of the reason is cost its estimated that optimal ccs technology can cost about as much as the power station itself to install and running it can consume up to 20 of a stations power output this means more fuel is needed to produce the same amount of power compared to a conventional power plant of similar efficiency without government support it remains a prohibitively expensive solution for many power generators with government support in the form of multidecade contracts large ccs or beccs plants could leverage economies of scale they could deliver energy companies and their shareholders a return on the investments in the longterm drax research and development past plans by drax could have put the company on a timeline towards becoming the worlds first large scale negative emitter of co 2  it would have achieved it firstly with the construction of a ccs power station at its selby north yorkshire site the 428 mw white rose power station was to be fuelled by a mixture of coal and biomass and once in operation could have paved the way for similar facilities elsewhere as carbon capture technology improved and costs came down but unfortunately the project never went ahead  there are some positive signs that carbon capture technologies are developing around the world the first clean coal power station became operational in the us earlier this month  and a second ccs plant is on the way a ukbacked carbon capture and use ccu project in india recently opened at a chemicals factory involving the capture of emissions for use in the manufacturing process  back in the uk where the government outlined plans to end coalfired power generation by 2025  carbon capture power stations must become financially competitive if they are to become a major part of the countrys low carbon future but if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must and beccs remains a leading technology to help achieve it tags biomass energy  power station  energy policy  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  negative emissions building a 21st century port 16 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy in its long history the port of liverpool has dealt with a number of industries its a port characterised by its ability to adapt to the needs of the time in 1715 it emerged as one of the worlds first ever wet docks in the 18 th century it was used as a hub for the slave trade when slavery was abolished in the early 19th century liverpool switched to bringing in the goods of the thriving empire such as cotton when goods like cotton dried up it switched to the fuel of the industrial revolution coal now as the world and the uk government moves away from fuels like coal and towards lowercarbon and renewable resources the port of liverpool needed to adapt once again gary hodgson chief operating officer at peel ports  explains about three years ago everyone was asking what happens after coal what happens after coal peel ports is one of the biggest operators of liverpools shipping infrastructure including liverpool port seeing that the future of coal was finite it recognised there was a need for a port that could bring in alternative renewable fuels at the same time drax was looking for a logistics partner to facilitate the importing of compressed wood pellets since 2009 drax power station had begun a process of upgrading its coalfired boilers to run on sustainable biomass sourced from huge wellestablished working forests  more than this it had plans to set up its own pellet manufacturing plants in the us south and needed to import large quantities of wood pellets the relationship with peel ports and liverpool was obvious this began a 100 million investment that helped transform the regions portstation transport infrastructure its about working in partnerships with companies says hodgson working this way helps develop solutions that really work the central element of the partnership between drax and peel ports was a radical redesigning of the technical infrastructure not only do compressed wood pellets have fundamentally different physical properties to other fuels like coal they are more combustible and need to be handled safely for the threemilliontonnecapacity facility that peel ports and drax wanted to build innovative supply chain solutions had to be developed shifting biomass in bulk the first challenge was getting the highdensity pellets off giant ships for this peel and drax designed a solution that uses an archimedean screw  a long tube with a spiral winding up the inside that allows liquids or materials that can behave like a liquid like wood pellets to defy gravity and travel upwards at the top of the screw the pellets are emptied onto a conveyor belt and carried to one of three purposebuilt silos tailored to safely storing thousands of tonnes of biomass  here the pellets wait until another conveyor belt deposits them onto speciallydesign biomass trains where they are transported across the peaks of the pennines to drax power station near selby in north yorkshire each step at the port is automated designed with supreme efficiency in mind by a team of drax and peel port engineers endtoend port to power station the whole process can take as little as 12 hours a new chapter for the north in the varied history of the port of liverpool the new facility is another chapter one that is helping transform the logistics infrastructure and the economic growth of the north west now open and operational the facility directly employs 50 people  around 500 additional contractors have worked on the project during its construction and development more than that its an investment in the countrys energy future it secures a fourth port for drax  three others are on the east coast  helping with security of supply we made this investment because we recognised this as the future of the energy mix of the country hodgson explain we cant just rely on one form of power  there has to be an energy mix and we see biomass as a key part of that tags biomass energy  sustainability  supply chain  ships and shipping the cleanest year in britains electricity 14 november 2016 power generation amid the political upheaval that is characterising 2016 you may have missed the quiet victory of the uks lowcarbon energy sector for the first time ever the third quarter q3 of 2016 saw more than 50 of the britains power come from lowcarbon energy sources five years ago lowcarbon sources made up just over a quarter this doesnt necessarily mean that renewable energy sources made up the full 50  in fact nuclear made up a considerable chunk  but it hints at the big changes were seeing in the way the country is sourcing its power for one its a further sign of coals diminishing life  during the period july to september 2012 coal supplied 38 of britains electricity  during this years q3 it supplied just 3 as a result perunit carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at their lowest levels ever the carbon price floor  also known as the carbon tax and designed to assist energy companies like drax invest in renewable and lower carbon generation  has played a big role in reducing coals contribution the findings come from electric insights  an independent report produced by researchers from imperial college london and commissioned by drax that looks at the uks publicly available electricity data and aims to inform the debate on britains electricity system beyond the continued decline of coal it shows theres a growing diversity in lowcarbon energy sources fuelling the country and that theres a positive outlook for a cleaner electricity future here we look at those lowcarbon sources and how their use has changed over the last five years nuclear at 26 of the total nuclear made up the largest proportion of lowcarbon power generation across q3 2016 that was good news for the sector which went through a turbulent summer after plans for the hinkley point c reactor were momentarily threatened following the dissolution of the department for energy and climate change decc after the brexit vote the eventual decision to continue with hinkley c however means that more baseload nuclear power in the form of large power stations and also possibly small modular nuclear reactors smrs will be coming on to the system in the coming years they will in the main replace older nuclear power stations set to be decommissioned wind wind power made up 10 of total lowcarbon power generation between july and september and was the largest renewable source of the quarter as recently as 2011 electricity generated by wind accounted for just 4 of britains low carbon energy supplies  a 150 increase in just five years this is in part due to huge offshore projects such as the 630 mw london array in the thames estuary and the 576mw gwynt y môr situated off the coast of north wales which have contributed to bringing the uks installed capacity to around 14 gw the uk is now the worlds sixth largest producer of wind power behind china the usa india germany and spain solar following wind power as the second largest renewable contributor to the countrys lowcarbon energy needs was solar five years ago solars contribution was so negligible it didnt even chart in the electric insights data fast forward to 2016 and britain has a total installed solar capacity of nearly 10 gw again this places the country sixth in the world for capacity behind china germany japan the usa and italy biomass biomass  a unique lowcarbon fuel in that it can deliver both baseload and flexible power  made up 4 of the uks power needs in q3 2016 a good proportion of that came from drax which has over the last five years been upgrading from coal to run on compressed wood pellets  like solar biomass generation didnt even chart in 2011 but today in fact between july and september biomass along with solar and wind supplied 20 of the countrys electricity  a huge proof point for the rise of renewables where biomass sits apart from those two sources however is that it isnt dependent on weather and even though the country has less much less biomass generation capacity than the two intermittent technologies it produces nearly as much energy as them this makes it an ideal baseload partner for sources that do ie wind and solar as it can be dialled up and down to meet the energy demand of the country in seconds in the future theres potential to increase this biomass capacity while saving bill payers money  three of draxs six generating units run on biomass but if all were to be upgraded as they could be in less than three years  drax plus lynemouth power station and one or two smaller biomass power stations  could generate roughly 10 of britains electricity using compressed wood pellets by the time unabated coal power stations come off the system before the end of 2025  hydro hydropower made up just 1 of britains power generation over the quarter however this is still up by 20 since 2011 when hydropower contributed just 08 total installed hydropower capacity is around 165gw however studies have found the country has a potential hydropower capacity of close to double this amount  but as many of these sources are located in mountainous rural landscape areas of natural importance its doubtful whether hydropower will be deployed up to its full capabilities in the coming years closing an historic year may the 5 th was an historic day in the uk  it was the first time since 1881 britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity it wasnt an isolated incident either in the third quarter of 2016 britain was completely coal free for nearly six days its a situation that is likely to continue in the future as low carbon energy sources  and in particular renewables  continue to grow in the countrys energy

poses a considerable maintenance challenge for the first time since draxs six towers were constructed between 1967 and 1974  one of them was in need of repair what could possibly go wrong no matter how well you build something things can go wrong after more than five decades of continuous operation each tower is made from concrete that varies in thickness from seven inches in the middle to around 15 inches at the top and bottom over time even a structure this solid can begin to weaken cooling towers are reinforced with steel bars embedded within their concrete which can rust and expand causing the concrete around it to crack  a process called spalling water vapour which passes through the towers on an almost constant basis can also migrate into poorly compacted concrete inside the tower and cause further cracks before the drax team could set about repairing the towers they needed to know where these cracks were inspecting a structure that tall needed an innovative solution it needed drones surveying the damage drones were used to make a comprehensive photographic record of the towers that could be inspected for signs of damage the drones also helped produce a 3d model of the structure to visualise the towers defects it was the firstofakind for the company the drone survey found that on tower 3b there were a number of cracked concrete patches on the towers that needed repairing and maintenance was scheduled to coincide with draxs 2016 outages  periods during the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the power station undergo routine repair work the next challenge was how to carry out these repairs on a structure taller than the statue of liberty to inspect the cooling tower drax created a 3d model with the help of cyberhawk  engineering at an altitude drax tower 3b is nearly 115 metres tall enough to fit in the statue of liberty or st pauls cathedral with room to spare how do you go about repairing a structure like this the answer steeplejacks steeplejacks were called so because originally they were the people used for scaling the side of church steeples to make repairs but a cooling tower presents a distinctly different structure that cant necessarily be climbed up from the bottom to scale it and make the repairs a different approach was needed drax reached out to specialist steeplejack contractors zenith structural access  who build devices that allow the scaling of industrialscale structures zeniths solution was to fix a metal frame to the top of the tower which then lowers a walkway suspended by strong metal cables down its side from a perch suspended from the top of tower 3b workmen were deployed to make the repairs  more than 100 metres above ground suspended in their cradles the teams sealed the surface of each crack and then injected resin to fix the cracks in the concrete shell where the concrete had spalled new specialist repair mortars were applied regular repairs with the identified defects on the tower fully repaired attention can now move on to others on site routine inspections using drones and binoculars have been planned to take place every three years these will monitor the condition of all the towers and allow for future maintenance to be planned in advance two more towers are already scheduled for repair in 2017s outages once again itll be case for engineering work at
