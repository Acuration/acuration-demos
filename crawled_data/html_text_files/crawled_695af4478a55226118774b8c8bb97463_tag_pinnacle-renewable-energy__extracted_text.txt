major planned outage on cfd 1 unit completed on schedule incremental power sales on biomass roc 2 units since july 2021 capturing higher prices commissioning of 550kt of new biomass pellet production capacity in us southeast 2021 adjusted ebitda 3  around the top end of current range of analyst expectations subject to continued baseload generation on biomass units throughout december positive policy developments for biomass and framework for uk beccs 4 pellet production in north america the group has made good progress integrating pinnacle renewable energy inc pinnacle since acquisition in april 2021 and is currently in the final stages of commissioning over 360kt of new production capacity at demopolis alabama in october 2021 the group commissioned a 150kt expansion at its lasalle plant in louisiana and at leola arkansas a new 40kt satellite plant is due to be commissioned in december these developments alongside incremental new capacity in 2022 support the groups continued focus on production capacity expansion and cost reduction once fully commissioned drax will operate around 5mt of production capacity across three major north american fibre baskets  british columbia alberta and the us southeast of which around 2mt are contracted to highquality thirdparty counterparties under longterm contracts with the balance available for draxs ownuse requirements there has been no disruption to ownuse or thirdparty volumes from the global supply chain delays currently being experienced in some other sectors however as outlined at the groups 2021 half year results summer wildfires led to pellet export restrictions in canada more recently heavy rainfall and flooding in british columbia have led to some further disruption to rail movements and regional supply chains through its enlarged and diversified supply chain drax has been able to manage and limit the impact on biomass supply for ownuse and to customers in addition due to the groups active and longterm hedging of freight costs there has been no material impact associated with higher market prices for ocean freight the group uses longterm contracts to hedge its freight exposure on biomass for its generation business and following the acquisition of pinnacle is taking steps to optimise freight requirements between production centres in the us southeast and western canada and end markets in asia and europe generation in the uk the groups biomass and pumped storage generation assets have continued to play an important role providing stability to the uk power system at a time when higher gas prices european interconnector issues and periods of low wind have placed the system under increased pressure the groups strong forward sold position means that it has not been a significant beneficiary of higher power prices from these activities in 2021 but has been able to increase forward hedged prices in 2022 and 2023 in march the groups two legacy coal units ended commercial generation activities and will formally close in september 2022 following the fulfilment of their capacity market obligations reflecting the system challenges described above these units were called upon in the balancing mechanism by the system operator for limited operations in september and november these shortterm measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and have not resulted in any material increase in the groups total carbon emissions in september the generation business experienced a twoweek unplanned outage on one biomass unit operating under the roc scheme the units contracted position in this period was bought back and the generation reprofiled across the two unaffected biomass roc units and deferred until the fourth quarter during this period the groups pumped storage power station cruachan provided risk mitigation from the operational or financial impact of any additional forced outages in november the generation business successfully completed a major 98 day planned outage on its biomass cfd unit which included the third in a series of highpressure turbine upgrades drax now expects the unit to benefit from thermal efficiency improvements and lower maintenance costs incrementally reducing the cost of biomass generation at drax power station customers the group continues to expect the customers business will return to profitability at the adjusted ebitda level for 2021 inclusive of an expected increase in mutualisation costs associated with the failure of a number of energy supply businesses in the second half of 2021 separately the group is continuing to assess operational and strategic solutions to support the development of the sme 5 supply business full year expectations reflecting these factors the group now expects that full year adjusted ebitda for 2021 will be around the top of the range of current analyst expectations 6  subject to good operational performance during december including baseload running of all four biomass units the groups financial expectations do not include any balancing mechanism activity in december for the coal units drax continues to expect net debt to adjusted ebitda to return to around 2x by the end of 2022 negative emissions in october the uk government selected the east coast cluster and hynet as the first two regional clusters in the uk to take forward the development of the infrastructure required for carbon capture and storage in addition the uk government published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and indicating that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support the development of beccs to meet these requirements the group is continuing to progress its work on beccs with the aim to develop 8mt of negative co 2 emissions pa

2021 once the new capacity is commissioned pinnacles nameplate production capacity is expected to increase to 29 million tonnes per annum pinnacle has ownership of c80 of this nameplate capacity with the remaining c20 coowned with its forestry industry joint venture partners ensuring strong commercial relationships and shared interests in security of supply pinnacle has sales and marketing rights to 100 of the output from all sites pinnacle is a key supplier of wood pellets for drax and other third parties in asia and europe with c67 billion of contracted thirdparty sales including sales to drax wood pellets loaded onto vessel at westview terminal british columbia through scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing pinnacle is currently produces biomass at a lower cost than drax with a likeforlike 2019 production cost of us124tonne 3  compared to draxs 2019 production cost of us161tonne 3  the pro forma 2019 production cost for the combined business is us141tonne pinnacles lower cost partially reflects the use of high levels of lowcost sawmill residues british columbia has a large and wellestablished commercial forestry industry which has in recent years seen increased harvest levels in part associated with management of a pine beetle infestation producing good levels of residue material availability for the production of biomass this infestation has now run its course and alongside other influences on the forest landscape including wildfire is resulting in a reduction in the annual harvest and sawmill closures the industry is adjusting to this with some production curtailment as well as developing approaches to fibre recovery and use which is expected to result in some increase in fibre costs since 2017 the sustainable biomass program has conducted annual audits of each of pinnacles operational sites allowing drax to ensure through its diligence that the material that it purchases from pinnacle is in line with its sustainability standards drax is committed to ensuring best practice in health and safety operational efficiency and sustainability across the enlarged group and intends to invest accordingly to deliver this outcome drax is committed to ensuring that its biomass sources are compliant with draxs wellestablished responsible sourcing policy and drax expects to invest in adapt and develop sourcing practices to ensure compliance with draxs policies to deliver both draxs biomass strategy and positive forest outcomes a large and geographically diversified asset base pinnacle has ownership interests in ten operational plants and one in development commissioning 2021 six of which are operated through joint venture arrangements providing access to nameplate production capacity of 29 million tonnes per annum seven of pinnacles sites are in british columbia 16 million tonne nameplate capacity and two are in alberta 06 million tonne nameplate capacity all of these sites have rail lines to ports at either prince rupert or vancouver both accessing the pacific ocean providing routes to asian and european markets pinnacle also operates a us hub at aliceville alabama 03 million tonne nameplate capacity and is developing a second site in demopolis alabama 04 million tonne nameplate capacity which pinnacle expects to commission in 2021 pinnacles total operational and development nameplate capacity in the us is 07 million tonnes pinnacles us sites are close to draxs existing operations in the southeastern us and will utilise river barges to access the port of mobile and bargetoship loading reducing fixed port storage costs working forest in lasalle bioenergy catchment area louisiana all production sites are located in areas with access to fibre and are able to operate with a range of biomass material from existing commercial forestry activities including sawmill residues precommercial thinnings and lowgrade wood combined with a geographic spread of production capacity and access to three separate export facilities pinnacle benefits from operational and sourcing flexibility further enhancing draxs security of supply further information is set out in appendix 1 to this announcement longterm biomass revenues with access to asian and european markets pinnacle has contracted sales of c67 billion with highquality asian and european counterparties including drax this equates to 99 of its current production capacity contracted to third parties through 2026 and a significant volume contracted in 2027 and beyond providing longterm highquality revenues vessel carrying biomass pellets at westview terminal british columbia pinnacle has been supplying biomass to europe since 2004 the location of the majority of pinnacles production capacity in western canada with access to the pacific ocean provides a strong position from which to serve the growing demand for biomass in asian markets in 2018 and 2019 pinnacle entered into 12 new longterm contracts in japan and south korea totalling over 13 million tonnes per annum valued at c46 billion with most contracts commencing between 2021 and 2023 the average contract duration is nine years with certain contracts extending significantly beyond this point contracts typically operate on a takeorpay basis global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the global biomass wood pellet market has a broad range of providers that are expected to expand their production capacity including operators such as enviva graanul invest pinnacle an viet phat fram and sy energy the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by asian demand 5  drax believes that increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and an improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand train pulling biomass wagons storage domes and wood pellet conveyor system drax power station north yorkshire as a vertically integrated producer and consumer of sustainable biomass drax is differentiated from its peers and well positioned to deliver supply chain efficiencies and an expanded range of sustainable biomass materials for ownuse and thirdparty sales through its expanding lower cost supply chain expertise in biomass generation and enhanced global footprint drax believes that there will be opportunities to work with other companies and countries in developing their own biomassenabled decarbonisation strategies strong return on investment the acquisition is expected to be cash generative and represent an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders with expected returns significantly in excess of the groups weighted average cost of capital the addition of longterm contracts with highquality counterparties in growing international biomass markets will reduce the groups relative exposure to commodity prices in line with the groups objective to improve earnings quality and visibility in total the acquisition increases access to lower cost biomass by a further 29 million tonnes after the commissioning of the demopolis plant in 2021 the price paid for this capacity is consistent with the previously outlined strategy to invest in the region of c600 million to deliver draxs plans for five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity and a biomass cost of 50mwh by 2027 for the year ended 27 december 2019 pinnacle generated adjusted ebitda 6 of c47 million from pellet sales of 17 million tonnes pinnacles 2019 performance was impacted by fire at its entwistle plant reduced rail access due to rail industrial action and weather disrupted forestry activity at the same time pinnacle experienced regional canadian sawmill closures resulting in some reduction in sawmill residues and an increase in provincial fibre prices fibre diversification and the development of a second hub in the southeastern us is expected to partially mitigate the risk of fibre price rises taking these factors into account alongside the commissioning of new capacity and the commencement of asian supply contracts pinnacles 2022 consensus ebitda is c99 million increasing to c126 million in 2023 bloomberg the acquisition strengthens the groups ability to pay a sustainable and growing dividend drax does not expect the acquisition to have any impact on its expectations for the final dividend payment for 2020 financing the acquisition the acquisition is expected to be funded from cash and existing agreements on 15 december 2020 the group issued a trading update which noted cash and total committed liquidity of 643 million at 30 november 2020 following the completion on 31 january 2021 of the sale of four gas power stations previously announced on 15 december 2020 the group received cash of 188 million being the agreed purchase price consideration of 164 million and 24 million of customary working capital adjustments net debt to adjusted ebitda 7 in 2021 is expected to be above draxs longterm target of around 2 times immediately after completion of the acquisition but is expected to return to around this level by the end of 2022 management of foreign exchange exposure the acquisition price will be paid in canadian dollars pinnacles existing contracts with drax and third parties are denominated in canadian and us dollars and drax expects to manage any exposure within its foreign exchange processes draxs policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposure on contracted biomass volumes over a rolling fiveyear period this has given rise to an average foreign exchange rate hedge around 140 usgbp sustainable sourcing sustainably sourced biomass is an important part of uk and european renewable energy policy the renewable status of sustainably sourced biomass is based on wellestablished scientific principles set out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and reflected in the european unions eu second renewable energy directive and the uk renewables obligation drax maintains a rigorous approach to biomass sustainability ensuring the wood fibre it uses is fully compliant with the uks mandatory standards as well as those of the eu dead pine trees in background infected with mountain pine beetle british columbia drax recognises that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to commercially managed forests in the southeastern us working in partnership with engo earthworm drax has a good understanding of the considerations associated with sourcing residues from harvesting of primary forest and the particular characteristics of the forests in british columbia and alberta in line with its responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with engo partners indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas operational efficiencies improvements and savings the strong financial returns associated with the acquisition are not dependent on synergy benefits but the group has identified areas for potential operational improvements and efficiencies and opportunities to invest across the supply chain to achieve consistent standards and improve outputs across the enlarged group portfolio optimisation drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio drax believes that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers with existing plans to widen of the groups sustainable biomass fuel mix to include a wider range of lower cost sustainable biomass materials drax expects to create further opportunities to optimise fuel cargos for own use and thirdparty supply logistics optimisation drax believes that the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged group will provide greater opportunities to optimise logistics with delivery of cargos to a counterpartys closest port reducing distance time carbon footprint and cost enhanced security of supply control of draxs biomass supply chain with geographically diverse production and export facilities is expected to enhance security of supply further mitigating the risk of supply interruptions thereby resulting in improved reliability and a reduced risk of supply interruption combined expertise drax believes that there will be opportunities to share best practice and drive improved production performance across the enlarged group by leveraging combined expertise in the production of goodquality lowcost pellets across the enlarged supply chain drax also expects to leverage pinnacles experience in developing and managing thirdparty offtake agreements alongside its existing commercial and trading capabilities to develop new agreements for supply to thirdparties stronger counterparty credit drax has a stronger credit rating which could enable pinnacle to develop its supply capability and contracts in asian and european markets beyond its current position reduced cost of debt draxs average cost of debt is lower than pinnacles giving rise to potential future savings corporate cost savings drax expects to derive typical corporate cost savings associated with the acquisition and delisting from the
