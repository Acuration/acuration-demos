Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group said:
“Drax has supported its customers, communities and employees throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and I want to thank colleagues across the Group for their commitment and hard work over the last year. We have delivered strong results, a growing dividend for shareholders and excellent progress against our business strategy.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner in the control room at Drax Power Station [Click to view/download]
“Our focus is on renewable power. Our carbon intensity is one of the lowest of all European power generators. We aim to be carbon negative by 2030 and are continuing to make progress. We are announcing today that we will not develop new gas fired power at Drax. This builds on our decision to end commercial coal generation and the recent sale of our existing gas power stations.
“The proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy will position Drax as the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business, paving the way for us to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – taking us even further in our decarbonisation.”
2021 outlook
Targeting carbon negative
No new gas generation at Drax Power Station, retain options for system support gas in next capacity auction
Completion of sale of existing gas generation (January 2021) and end of commercial coal (March 2021)
Progressing biomass strategy
Proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (Pinnacle) – supports long-term options for third-party supply, BECCS and biomass generation
BECCS – commencement of DCO planning process, potential FEED study and clarity on regional clusters
