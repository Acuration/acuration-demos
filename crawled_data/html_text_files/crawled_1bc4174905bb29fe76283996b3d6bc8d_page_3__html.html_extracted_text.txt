Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP)
The Sustainable Biomass Program
21 March 2018
Sustainable bioenergy

In 2013, Drax co-founded the
SBP
together with six other energy companies.
SBP builds upon existing forest certification programmes, such as the Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). These evidence
sustainable forest management
practices but do not yet encompass regulatory requirements for
reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
. This is a critical gap for biomass generators, who are obligated to report GHG emissions to European regulators.
There is also limited uptake of forest-level certification schemes in some key forest source areas. SBP is working to address these challenges.
SBP certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met. The tool is a unique
certification scheme
designed for woody biomass, mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips, used in industrial, large-scale energy production.
SBP certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of
wood pellet
and wood chip producers and biomass traders, carried out by independent, third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee.

Working with our suppliers
Sustainable bioenergy

Pinewells, Lda.
is part of Grupo Visabeira with global interests in the telecommunications, construction, manufacturing, technology, real estate and energy sectors. Constructed in 2009, the biomass plant in Portugal is one of the strategic investments of the group in the renewable energy sector. The plant has an annual biomass production of 150,000 tonnes, supplying both the international industrial and the internal domestic biomass markets.
Drax worked closely with Pinewells in 2017 to ensure the feedstock used for production is both harvested lawfully and sustainable by meeting the requirements of the Drax supplier data return and third-party audit. Working with the forest and quality engineers at Pinewells, we have supported the company to develop and implement their monitoring and inspection system within their own supply base.
Key features of this system include desk-based research to determine the characterisation of harvesting areas and field audits to approve the felling areas, highlight the Good Forest Practice Guide and deliver focused training. This work has provided a valuable foundation for Pinewells to implement the
Sustainable Biomass Program
(SBP) within their supply chain.
“Working with Drax this year has provided us guidance and understanding towards the requirements of SBP certification. The encouragement and advice from the Drax sustainability team proved both valuable and practical.”

7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy
28 November 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Biomass is playing an important role in moving the UK away from coal. At Drax Power Station, in the form of
compressed wood pellets
, biomass is already supplying roughly
17% of Great Britain’s renewable power
.
But more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation, it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network. Among renewable sources of power, biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations – such as
frequency control
and
inertia
. This inherrent
flexibility
is vital in maintaining stability on Britain’s high voltage transmission system. Wood pellets can also
reliably
generate power, helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine and avoiding reliance on diesel, coal and gas.
However, for the UK and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass, it must be produced sustainably. More than this, its supply chain must be low in emissions so that
clear savings can be made
versus power generation with fossil fuels.
To ensure this, the use of biomass is regulated in the UK under EU Timber Regulations and the
Renewables Obligation (RO)
. But further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the European Parliament’s update to the
Renewable Energy Directive
(RED), which will specify criteria for all biomass.
There is a clear need for this, but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles.
A new report by Drax
outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future.
1. Forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests
The sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental, social and economic health of that supply region.
For example, a
properly managed forest
can boost carbon stock as the younger, faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more CO
2
than older, over-mature trees.  Thinning operations also
increase the growth of the biggest and best trees
, ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products.
Generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higher-risk areas where extracting biomass could cause long-term carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems, as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss, soil erosion or depletion of water sources.
2. Bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from high-risk feedstocks
Feedstocks, the raw materials turned into biomass pellets, must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk.
In 2016 around
40% of all feedstock supplied to Drax originated as a sawmill residue
.
Processes such as thinning
also serve as a source of biomass feedstock, while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest.
Thinning a semi mature stand
of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value saw-timber trees,
storing more carbon
and generating more stable revenue streams. Having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises
land owners
to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development.
3. Carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted
To understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy, carbon savings need to be measured.
Factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting, processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure.
4. Bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied
Unlike coal or oil, which will eventually run out, more trees can be planted, grown and harvested.
That said, there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet, and so it should not be considered an infinite resource. This is why it’s crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines. In short, to ensure biomass truly is sustainable, it is essential that
working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity
.
5. Support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings
One of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the UK rapidly adapt to meet the EU target of achieving
27% of final energy consumption from renewables.
The fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the UK’s carbon emissions is through
converting coal power stations to biomass
, as is the case at Drax Power Station.
This repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy, but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources can’t.
Quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise.
6. The efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets
Globally, there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry by-products that currently go unused.
Biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained. To enable this to function effectively on a global scale, trade restrictions should be avoided.
Pelletisation
offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe, cost-efficient and low-carbon to transport around the world.
These principals are tried and tested by Drax and known to
protect forests
and
ecosystems
, as well as
optimise supply chains
to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum. Ultimately, Drax’s experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems.
7. The sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified
One of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing third-parties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with.
In Europe,
forest level management certification
schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by
Forest Europe
. Outside of Europe, where Drax sources
most of its biomass
, independent, third part auditors can ensure the UK’s stringent criteria are being met on the ground.

Keeping the options open
19 October 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Roughly
750 million acres of the US
is covered in forestland – an area nearly 12 times the size of the UK. Approximately two-thirds of that land is working timberland, producing wood used for construction and furniture. In short, US forestry is a massive industry.
Enviva
is the world’s largest
wood pellet
producer and biggest biomass supplier to
Drax Power Station
, but in the context of the US forestry industry in which it operates, Enviva does things differently.
“We’re leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices,” says Jennifer Jenkins, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer at Enviva. “We’ve created unique tracking systems and we conduct science-based sourcing, both of which encourage sound forest stewardship.”
Specifically, Enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesn’t.
Protecting bottomland forests
A bottomland forest is an area of low-lying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species. These forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important. However, they’re also a part of south-eastern America’s
working forest
landscape.
In fact, Enviva sources
3-4% of its wood from these areas
, but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest. For example, in some cases, harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms, clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive. More than that, harvesting can also help keep forests as forests.
“In the areas where we work, one of the
biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use
– specifically to developed or agricultural land,” explains Dr. Jenkins. “Our goal is to keep forests as forests. We want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use.” If
landowners
can gain a steady income from regular harvests, they’re likely to keep their land as working forests.
However, this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe. Any land that doesn’t meet Enviva’s set of strict criteria means Enviva won’t source from it – it can simply walk away. The landowners, on the other hand, don’t have that luxury.
“Isn’t it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest?” asks Dr. Jenkins. “Maybe they recognize its value. Maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead. In recognition of our responsibility, we made a commitment.”
A fund that keeps forests as forests
Enviva’s commitment was to partner with the US Endowment for Forestry & Communities to set up the
Enviva Forest Conservation Fund
, a $5 million, 10-year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the Virginia-North Carolina coastal plain.
It works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value. Last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects. More recently,
in June 2017
, the Enviva Forest Conservation Fund announced a total of $500,000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as
Ducks Unlimited
, an organization which – with the grant – plans to acquire more than 6,000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public Wildlife Management Area.
The Fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes, including a strict supplier assessment process and the company’s
Track & Trace tool
, a one-of-a-kind publicly-accessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood Enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced. It is entirely transparent and is a testament to Enviva’s commitment to sustainability and doing things differently.
As Dr. Jenkins explains, this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004: “As a company that makes wood pellets, Enviva’s reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions. An emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of Enviva’s DNA.”

Sustainability, certified
24 March 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Of all the changes to Drax Power Station over the last decade, perhaps the biggest is one you can’t see. Since converting three of its six generating
units
from coal to run primarily on compressed
wood pellets
, Drax has reduced those units’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over
80%
.
And while this is a huge improvement, it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isn’t
sustainably sourced
.
For this reason, Drax works with internationally-recognised
certification programmes
that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental, social and economic criteria.
Thanks to these certification programmes, Drax can be confident it is not only reducing GHG emissions, but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced.
Sustainability certifications
The compressed wood pellets used at Drax Power Station come from
various locations
around the world, so Drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes, the three main ones being the
Sustainable Forest Initiative
(SFI),
Forest Stewardship Council
®
(FSC
®
)
1
and the
Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification
(PEFC).
The programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management, but adoption rates vary by region. European landowners and regulators are most familiar with the FSC and national PEFC standards, while North American landowners generally prefer SFI and American Tree Farm System (also members of the PEFC family). In instances in which Drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications, or in instances in which Drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests, these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable.
Over 50% of the pellets used at Drax Power Station come from the
southern USA
, where SFI and American Tree Farm System are the most widely implemented certification programmes. Overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest. However, the SFI offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by wood-procuring entities, such as sawmills, pulp mills and pellet mills.
This programme is referred to as SFI Fiber Sourcing, and to obtain it, participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources. These sources may or may not include certified forests. The programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity, water quality, landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals. Together, these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides Drax with a significant proportion of its pellets.
And since the SFI and ATFS programmes are endorsed by PEFC, North American suppliers have a pathway for their region’s sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by European stakeholders.
These certification programmes have been in use for many years. But with recent growth in the market for wood pellets, a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass.
New kid on the block
The
Sustainable Biomass Program
(SBP) was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources. But rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes, it builds on them.
For example, SBP recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes. However, the PEFC, SFI and FSC programmes do not include requirements for reporting GHG emissions, a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to European regulators. SBP fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets.
When a new entity, such as a wood pellet manufacturer, first seeks certification under SBP, that entity is required to assess its supply base.
Feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme (SFI, FSC
®
, PEFC or PEFC approved schemes) is considered SBP-compliant.
All other feedstock must be evaluated against SBP criteria, and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 SBP indicators.
If during the process a specific risk is identified, for example to the forest ecosystem, the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk, such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded.
These assessments are audited by independent, third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee.
In conducting the risk assessment, the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes.
Sustainable energy for the UK
Counting major energy companies including DONG Energy, E.ON and Drax as members, the SBP has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry. At the end of 2016, the SBP had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries – including Drax’s pellet manufacturing arm,
Drax Biomass
, in Mississippi and Louisiana.
It’s a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass, and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides Drax with the assurance that it is powering the UK using biomass from legal and sustainable sources.
Like the fast-reducing carbon dioxide emissions of Britain’s
power generation sector
, it’s a change you can’t see, but one that is making a big difference.

The new Renewable Energy Directive and what it means for biomass
29 November 2016
Sustainable bioenergy

***This story was published the day before the announcement by the European Commission. Please scroll to the bottom of this page for the Drax view ***.
When the European Union set out its policy for the promotion of renewable energy in the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (RED) it set a very ambitious target: by 2020, renewables should make up 20% of the EU’s energy consumption. Each Member State was given a specific goal and made to detail exactly how it would hit this.
The Directive was comprehensive in many ways, but it didn’t include a clear sustainability policy for solid biomass, including
compressed wood pellets
. As one of the
largest sources of renewable energy in Europe
, this left a policy gap that many voices – including Drax – have called to be filled.
It’s a wish that will now be granted. A revised RED is set to be published by the EU that will specify clear criteria for all biomass.
“Sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy but Drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way.”
Dorothy Thompson, Drax Group CEO, July 2014
Importance of sustainable biomass
Biomass is a well-established and essential part of the renewable energy mix. It offers a unique mix of reliability, flexibility and affordability, all while helping to deliver carbon reductions. This makes it particularly important as countries like the UK seek to
phase out coal generation
and hit the targets set out in the Paris Agreement.
However, in order to secure these carbon benefits biomass needs to be produced sustainably. This means that it comes from responsibly-managed, growing forests, and that the emissions from the supply chain are measured and minimised.
In the UK there are already
binding sustainability criteria
but this isn’t the case across the EU. Biomass use in the UK is regulated under the EU Timber Regulations and UK’s own Renewable Obligation (RO) biomass sustainability criteria.
The RO is a form of government support designed to incentivise large scale renewable electricity generation in the UK, and to qualify for this, energy companies must adhere to sustainability standards such as properly accounting for their
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
and only
sourcing from responsibly managed land and forests
.
An EU-wide approach to biomass that follows the UK’s could see the implementation of a risk-based scheme that asks large energy companies to prove how they mitigate against a set of identified risks – like those in the RO criteria. However, it’s important that compliance with these is independently verified – something that could be done by using independent schemes such as the
Sustainable Biomass Program
(SBP).
The SBP carries out supply-base evaluation of pellet producers to ensure the wood they’re using is
qualified as sustainable
and they’re meeting the RO criteria. Programmes like the SBP are already being used by most major biomass power generators in the EU and could act as a blueprint for the future.
Efficiency where effective
Only a few of the power stations across the EU are suitable for conversion from coal to biomass but those that are, like Drax, can deliver fast, significant carbon savings.
The thermal efficiency of such stations may not be as high as a newly built plant, but they do allow governments to quickly move away from coal. More than that, these plants can continue to provide the critical services – such as voltage control and
black start
– the grid needs to remain stable and that other renewables can’t.
Drax is one of these stations, and in the first half of 2016 it was able to deliver around 20% of the UK’s renewable power. Thanks to its conversion to biomass, it now does this with over 80% carbon reductions relative to coal.
With the abundance of suitable and sustainably-grown fibre that can be used for biomass electricity generation, there is a strong case for the EU to encourage the coal phase out by encouraging others to undergo conversion from coal to biomass.
But what’s also needed is a clear set of
sustainability criteria for biomass
. The move to define this is a step in the right direction but the final EU proposal needs to be a practical one.
If the updated RED achieves this, it will mean a bright future for renewable energy in Europe and a clearer path for meeting the continent’s Paris Agreement targets.
*** 30 November, 2016 UPDATE ***
Drax welcomes Renewable Energy Directive proposal
Drax welcomes the publication of the
Renewable Energy Directive
and
bioenergy policy proposal
. Drax has been at the forefront of calling for standards based on a risk-assessment to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass used for energy production.
Matt Willey, Public Affairs Director of Drax Power had said that:
“Drax has campaigned for a robust, pragmatic biomass sustainability policy for the whole EU for many years and today is a step in the right direction. It is important that large users of biomass can demonstrate forest regeneration is taking place, that areas of high conservation value are protected, that soil and water quality is maintained and that harvesting does not exceed the long-term production capacity of the forest. We welcome the fact the Commission proposes that voluntary national or international schemes, including those which use a risk based approach, can be used to provide evidence of sustainability.”
“The UK already has the toughest sustainability rules in the world so Drax can be sure our compressed wood pellets are sustainable but it makes sense to have a common policy across the EU.”
Drax Power has made huge efforts to demonstrate the
sustainability of its biomass
. Sourcing from regions with large surpluses combined with low wood paying capability, Drax is able to track and trace every shipment back to low risk areas, which assures that biodiversity is protected and promotes sustainable forest management.

Sustainable Biomass Program – proving biomass is sustainable
Dorothy Thompson, (2005-2017 Chief Executive, Drax Group)
14 April 2016
Opinion

I was honoured to be able to accept the
Excellence in Bioenergy
award recently. Not for myself, but on behalf of all my colleagues at Drax who have worked so hard to make a reality of our shared plan to generate reliable, renewable electricity. Our achievements are truly a team effort.
In 2015, Drax became a predominantly biomass-fuelled power station.
We now generate more electricity at Drax power station from compressed low-grade wood pellets than from coal – between three and four per cent of the UK’s entire demand every day.
It’s a major triumph for all the brilliant engineers involved in converting the plant and everyone who has helped secure the incredibly complex supply chain that keeps it running.
But we truly believe that this is only the beginning for sustainable biomass.
Sustainable biomass is the ideal fuel to help the world decarbonise in an affordable and reliable way. It can support other renewables like wind and solar when the elements are against them and backup power is needed.
Because it can be created by upgrading existing coal-fired power stations, it can be added to the electricity grid in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost of building new power stations. Why should the UK only build brand-new gas and nuclear power stations when existing coal power stations can be upgraded to low carbon, renewable tech? At Drax, we have shown how engineers working at what once was the biggest coal power station in western Europe can use their expertise to work with compressed wood pellet power generation.
And it can save bill payers billions of pounds when the true costs of bringing other renewables on stream are taken into account.
The industry’s greatest challenge right now is in proving that all the biomass we use is truly sustainable.
At Drax we have
proven the sustainability of the biomass we use
time and time again. But we can and will do more to ensure that standards right across the industry are always equally high.
We cannot underestimate the importance of sustainability. No corners can be cut. We must all join together and meet this challenge. Because without sustainable biomass there will be no industry at all. Without sustainable biomass in a balanced energy system with other renewables and low carbon technologies, the Paris climate change summit commitments may not be reached.
This is why the
Sustainable Biomass Program
is so important. The SBP has developed a
certification framework
to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources.
By working with the SBP, all of us in the industry alongside hard working families and businesses stand to benefit. Which is why all of us at Drax welcome its inception, and look forward to working with the SBP to help build a growing and healthy industry that helps our society transition to the renewable fuels of the future.
May 2017 update: the SBP has changed its name to the Sustainable Biomass Program — you can read its
first annual report here
