global temperature of the earth over long periods of time in a modern context climate change describes the rise of global temperatures that has been occurring since the industrial revolution in the 1800s what causes climate change while there have been natural fluctuations in the earths climate over previous millennia scientists have found that currentday temperatures are rising quicker than ever due to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gasses being released into the atmosphere an excess of co 2 in the atmosphere accentuates something called the greenhouse effect  as co 2 traps heat in the earths atmosphere it warms the planet and causes a rise in average global temperature international efforts such as the paris climate accords are dedicated to ensuring temperatures do not rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels which could lead to catastrophic conditions on the planet  in the modern context climate change describes the rise of global temperatures occurring since the industrial revolution in the 1800s how do humans contribute to climate change industries such as transport agriculture energy and manufacturing have traditionally relied on the use of coal oil and other fossil fuels these fuels when combusted or used emit large amounts of co 2 into the atmosphere further advancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to climate change human reliance and consumption of these products mean today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  why are rising temperatures harmful to the planet our planet has a history of experiencing periods of extreme weather conditions  for example the last ice age  which finished 12000 years ago however the rapid rise in temperatures seen today is harmful because a hotter planet completely affects our natural environment  a steep rise in global temperature can melt ice sheets and cause higher sea levels which can in turn contribute to more extreme storms and even threaten entire islands and coastal communities  as the planet warms extreme weather events such as bushfires could become more common which can destroy homes impact agriculture and degrade air quality while entire ecosystems habitats and animal and insect species could also be threatened by climate change  what can be done to mitigate the effects of climate change reducing co 2 emissions is a key way of slowing down the pace of climate change to do so industries across the global economy must decarbonise to become less dependent on fossil fuels such as coal and petrol and adopt new lower carbon energy sources decarbonisation will rely on a number of factors including a technological response that sees the development and implementation of carbon neutral and carbon negative ways of creating heat electricity and fuels including the use of innovations such as carbon capture and storage ccs there is also a need for a policy and governmental response that promotes investment in new cleaner technologies and disincentivises dirtier industries through mechanisms like the carbon tax  countries and economies will need to work collaboratively to achieve common climateoriented goals that will also enable smaller scale action to be taken by individuals around the world go deeper five learnings from the international panel on climate change report climate change is the biggest challenge of our time our climate future is actually our climate present ten times more energy storage is needed to help britain reach its net zero carbon target a

ancillary services power generation what are ancillary services ancillary services are a set of processes that enable the transportation of electricity around the grid while keeping the power system operating in a stable efficient and safe way why do we need ancillary services when electricity makes its way through the country it needs to be managed so that the power generation and electricity useage levels are equal the regulating of elements such as frequency and voltage has to be carefully managed so that the massive amounts of electricity moving  or transmitted  are able to be used safely in homes businesses schools and hospitals around the country ancillary services enable the power system to operate in a stable efficient and safe way what do ancillary services offer ancillary services include a wide variety of electrical efficiency and safety nets all focussed on ensuring the power system delivers enough output to meet demand yet remains stable frequency the uks power system runs at a frequency of 50 hertz  to stay balanced it has to remain at that frequency turbines and generators adjust the speed at which they spin automatically to increase or decrease power in line with demand and ensure that the system is kept stable voltage different parts of the uks transmission system use voltages of either 400 275 or 132 kilovolts to ensure that voltage remains within 5 of those figures at all times  to be safe for domestic electricity use power stations can produce or reabsorb excess energy as reactive power  keeping the overall system reliable inertia turbine use is important in keeping the system operating in its current state even with disruptions and sudden changes the electricity system uses the weight of heavy spinning turbines to create stability  acting as dampeners and smoothing out unexpected changes in frequency across the network reserve an important part of ancillary servicing is making sure that there are no surprises  so holding back power to release if something unexpected happens means that the network can function confidently knowing that there are generators and other power providers such as pumped hydro storage waiting ready to back it up who manages ancillary services in the uk the grids stability is managed by national grid electricity system operator eso  a separate company of national grid electricity transmission et  the eso works with ancillary service providers to either sign longterm contracts or make short term requests for a service these partners are often power stations such as drax power station which have large spinning turbines capable of controlling voltage frequency providing inertia and serving as a source of reserve power what is the future of ancillary services as we move to a more renewable system as the uks electricity system continues to change so to do its requirements for different ancillary services the switch from a few very large power stations to a greater variety of different electricity sources some of which may be dependent on the weather as well as changes in how the country uses electricity means there is a greater need for ancillary services to keep the grid stable these services have historically been delivered by thermal power stations but new innovations are enabling wind turbines to provide inertial response and overcome changes in frequency and batteries to store reserve power that can then be supplied to the power system to ensure balance ancillary services fast facts batteries can in some cases be cheaper ancillary alternatives to conventional sources of energy the hornsdale power reserve which runs on a tesla battery in south australia lowered the price of frequency ancillary services by 90 after just four months of use ancillary services usually work from habit knowing when to slow electricity production or increase supply based around the general publics standard working hours  dinner time and the early morning rush but during the covid19 lockdown  electricity consumption on weekdays fell by 13 and so national grid eso had to intervene with ancillary services to keep the lights on every year the esos ancillary services move 300 terawatt hours twh of electricity which is equal to 4 trillion kettles boiling at once  with recent innovations around renewable energies there are a wider variety of ways for ancillary services to generate power go deeper balancing for the renewable future ancillary services  greening the grid maintaining electricity grid stability through rapid decarbonisation renewable energy sources as a new participant in ancillary service markets how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from behind the power grid humans with highstakes jobs tags electricity generation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  faqs frequently asked questions  flexibility and stability and power system security  national grid what is reforestation and afforestation sustainable bioenergy what is reforestation and afforestation reforestation is the process of planting trees in a forest where the number of trees has been decreasing afforestation is when new trees are planted or seeds are sown in an area where there were no trees before creating a new forest why carry out reforestation and afforestation reforestation and afforestation are two of the leading naturebased solutions for tackling the effects of climate change for commercial foresters and landowners these two practices are essential to ensuring they can grow wood for wood products and continuously meet demand in a sustainable way reforestation is crucial in combating or preventing deforestation or forest degradation where forests shrink in size or are completely removed as well as reducing a forests ability to absorb carbon dioxide co 2  deforestation can destroy wildlife habitats and contribute to the likelihood of flooding in certain areas afforestation can also help avoid desertification where fertile land turns into a desert as a result of drought or intensive agriculture reforestation is the process of planting native trees in a forest where the number of trees has been decreasing how does reforestation and afforestation limit the effects of climate change forests are a natural way of keeping the earths co 2 levels in check the more trees there are the more co 2 is captured and converted into oxygen through photosynthesis by absorbing co 2  forests help to lower the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and reduce the effects of climate change reforestation and afforestation help maximize these abilities of forests by increasing the overall amount of forested land on the planet did you know different types of forests such as tropical swamps or mangroves  all absorb co 2 at different rates the age of a forest also impacts absorption young rapidly growing trees absorb co 2 at a faster rate than more mature ones which have large amounts of carbon locked in already afforestation is when new trees are planted or seeds are sown in an area where there were no trees before what roles does reforestation play in commercial forestry the global wood products industry depends on sustainable forests to supply the wood needed to make furniture create construction materials and provide fuel for energy the supply chain will often start with whats called a  working forest   a commerciallyrun forest which is often privately owned the landowner will grow a working forest to a certain stage of maturity and then harvest some or all of the trees to sell the wood once the wood has been sold for use as lumber wood products or fuel the landowner will reforest the areas to regrow the trees foresters will typically do this in stages across their land to ensure there are multiple stands of forest at different stages of growth across their land which ensures there is consistent sustainable growth at all times fast facts in july 2019 ethiopia planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours  which is believed to be an afforestation world record there are 7 billion hectares of treeless land on earth  where 12 trillion native tree saplings could naturally grow through afforestation increasing the earths forest cover by 25 could absorb 200 gigatonnes more co 2 from the atmosphere without infringing on existing cities or agricultural land go deeper theres a long history of sustainable thinking behind healthy productive working forests forests have long been a source of mystery and new discoveries are still being made today  reforestation and afforestation are both helping countries around the world to revive their forests  ensuring there is stable demand for wood products helps encourage healthy forests  tags faqs frequently asked questions  forestry and forest management and arboriculture  forests what is decarbonisation carbon capture what is decarbonisation decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide co 2  output of a countrys economy this is usually done by decreasing the amount of co 2 emitted across the active industries within that economy why is decarbonisation important currently a wide range of sectors  industrial residential and transport  run largely on fossil fuels  which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal oil or gas the co 2 emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas trapping in heat and contributing to global warming by using alternative sources of energy industries can reduce the amount of co 2 emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change why target carbon dioxide there are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming however co 2 is the most prevalent as of 2018 carbon levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  the paris agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures dont rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial level with 195 current signatories  economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon with the uk leading the g20 nations in decarbonising its economy in the 21 st century how is decarbonisation carried out there are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power such as wind turbines solar panels and coalto biomass upgrades  meaning that homes and businesses dont have to rely on fossil fuels other innovations such as using batteries and allowing homes to generate and share their own power can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation as the electricity itself is made cleaner it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process other approaches such as reforestation or carbon capture and storage  help to pull existing carbon from the air to neutralise carbon output  or in some cases help to make electricity generation  and even entire nations  carbon negative alternative power options means that homes and businesses dont have to rely on traditional carbon fuels what is the future of decarbonisation for decarbonisation to be more widely adopted as a method for combating climate change there needs to be structural economical change  according to deloitte access economics creating more room for decarbonisation through investing in alternative energies means that there are a multitude of jobrich shovelready stimulus opportunities that also unlock longterm value decarbonisation fast facts a study by carbon brief in 2019 found that the uks carbon emissions have decreased by 38 since 1990 which is faster than any other major developed nation the uk has committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by enshrining this goal as law  and announcing a 3 billion investment in low carbon technologies in 2019 currently heavy industry cement steel and chemicals and heavyduty transport mainly shipping and aviation account for 30 of co 2 emissions  worldwide energy consumption over a large range of sectors  including transport heating construction and production  is the biggest source of humancaused greenhouse gas emissions providing 73 of global carbon output iceland is the only nation to currently have 100 of its energy derived from natural sources  with 73 sourced
