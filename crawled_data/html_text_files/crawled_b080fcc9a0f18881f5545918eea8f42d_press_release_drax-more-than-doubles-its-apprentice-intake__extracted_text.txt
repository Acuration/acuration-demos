power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station drax more than doubles its apprentice intake thirteen apprentices have kick started their careers at drax power station  more than twice the number the uks biggest renewable power generator employed two years ago further boosting stem education and skills in the region 28 august 2019 twelve are technical apprentices who could go on to become the power generators engineers of the future with one further apprentice joining draxs system security team working to ensure the safety of all staff on site six will be in mechanical positions four in electrical and two working in the control and instrumentation teams in the first half of 2019 drax halved its carbon emissions compared to the year before with more than 90 of the power produced being renewable  enough for more than four million households this was made possible as a result of the world class innovation and skill of its inhouse engineers who pioneered the conversion of two thirds of the power station near selby in north yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass delivering carbon savings of more than 80 andy koss ceo generation said one of the highlights of my job is welcoming our newest apprentices to drax each year  these are the people who could be the shining stars of the future the ones who will help us to develop the new cutting edge technologies needed to enable our business to continue to grow supporting ambitious young people to develop their skills is critical to the future success of our business by helping them to grow and learn we can ensure that we have the talented workforce our business and the wider northern powerhouse region needs to thrive draxs technical apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside some of the best engineers in the world who have helped transform the business to become the largest decarbonisation project in europe and drax could go further  by scaling up its successful bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot it could become the worlds first negative emissions power station this means it would be reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the same time as producing renewable power  critical to reaching the uks net zero carbon ambitions this years apprentices are aged between 15 and 22 with five from goole and the rest coming from across yorkshire and north lincolnshire one of them dan callon was part of the successful team from selby college supported by drax which won the green power ev race for schools in hull earlier in the year dan from brayton in selby said of his new apprenticeship i knew i wanted to work in a handson practical engineering role but didnt want to go down the academic route having opportunities like this at drax was a really good move for me the 17yearold added i really enjoyed building and racing the electric car in the green power race which drax organised  i got to work with some of my friends from selby college as well as getting advice from engineers at drax  in the end we actually won the overall race im looking forward to progressing my career with drax learning new skills and getting some good experience here simran ley aged 20 has also joined drax as a technical apprentice she said i knew i wanted to go down the apprenticeship route as it provides the sort of practical experience you cant get at university drax is well known for its engineering it made it an obvious choice for me to apply to the drax technical apprenticeship training scheme is a fouryear programme and specialises in three engineering disciplines mechanical electrical and control  instrumentation draxs system security apprenticeship is a threeyear level 3 fire emergency and security systems apprenticeship in conjunction with lincoln college drax offers apprenticeships in engineering disciplines as well as business support areas such as finance and business administration all opportunities are advertised on our website ends media contacts matt willey drax group external affairs director e email protected t 07711376087 joshua
