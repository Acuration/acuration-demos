investors do electric vehicles actually reduce carbon emissions 19 august 2017 electrification electric vehicles evs are often seen as a key driver towards a greener future indeed transport accounts for roughly a quarter of the uks greenhouse gas emissions and seriously affects air quality in major cities to tackle pollution problems governments around the world are implementing ambitious policies to promote the electrification of transport and phase out ice internal combustion engine vehicles the uk and france both plan to ban the sale of petrol and dieselonly cars by 2040 while india is setting an even more ambitious end date of 2030  added to this are evs growing popularity with drivers there are now almost 110000 electric cars and vans on uk roads spurred on by lowering battery costs and a growing range of models including plugin hybrid vehicles evs now account for 2 of new registrations switching to evs is an obvious way to massively cut pollution in areas of dense traffic but the question remains  how clean are evs on the broader scale when you look at the electricity used to charge them electric vehicles are getting cleaner evs dont give off the same exhaust emissions as engines but the power in their batteries has to come from somewhere follow the flow back from the car through the charging point all the way back to the power station and its likely some of that electricity is coming from fossil fuels and that means emissions they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell a researcher at imperial college london and author of electric insights  a study commissioned by drax that analyses electricity generation data in britain now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk evs are delivering much better results he continues in fact yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to greener electricity generation today they are twice as efficient as conventional cars take the tesla model s in the winter of 2012 producing the electricity for a full charge created 124g of carbon emissions per km driven roughly the same as a 2l range rover evoque now the carbon intensity of charging a tesla has nearly halved to 74gkm in winter and 41 gkm in summer as the uk continues to break its own renewable energy records for smaller evs the results are even better the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can now be charged for less than half the co 2 of even the cleanest nonplugin ev the toyota prius hybrid so the current outlook for evs is hugely positive  but as their numbers continue to increase will the demand they add to the grid put their clean credentials at risk will evs accelerate electricity demand the national grid suggests there could be as many as nine million evs on uk roads by 2030 which could lead to an additional 410 gw of demand on the system at peak times  this in some cases could lead to a rise in emissions electricity demand in britain typically peaks between 6pm and 10pm when people arrive home and switch on lights and appliances if you were to charge your ev between those evening hours the emissions would be 8 higher than reported in the chart above if you charged between midnight and 6am they would be 10 lower today this demand is met by the existing mix of power stations which last quarter included more than 50 renewable and lowcarbon sources  but when there are sudden spikes in demand above this typical usage the national grid must call in the help of carbonintensive reserve generators such as coalpowered stations polluting diesel generators are also on standby around the uk ready to turn on and feed into regional distribution grids at a moments notice to meet the challenge of peaktime ev charging less carbon intensive power generation storage and smart power management systems are needed these include rapid response gas power stations such as the four drax ocgts planned to come online in the early 2020s as well as gridscale batteries homebased batteries and demandside response schemes as the share of intermittent renewable capacity on the grid increases more backup power needs to be available for when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine keeping our future fuels clean a future increasingly relying on backup generators is far from inevitable especially if the use of smart technology and smart meters increases by analysing electricity costs and countrywide demand smart meters have the potential to ensure evs only charge outside peak times unless absolutely necessary when electricity is more likely to come from renewable or lowcarbon and cheaper sources if the grid continues to decarbonise through advances in renewable technologies and lowercost coaltobiomass conversions the potential of evs electricity coming with associated emissions is diminished even further there is no doubt that evs will make up a significant part in the future of our mobility that they will also play a part in the future of cleaning up that mobility is as good as assured but on this journey its imperative we keep our eyes on the road commissioned by

tags electric vehicles evs  decarbonisation  investors  electric insights what you need to know about britains electricity last quarter 17 august 2017 power generation for an hour over lunch on wednesday 7 th june more than 50 of britains electricity came from renewables it was only the second time this had ever happened  the first had come just two months earlier in april the second quarter q2 of 2017 was a period largely made up of firsts for britains electricity system while there were only two instances of renewable power tipping the 50 mark between april and june overall wind solar biomass and hydro energy made up more than a quarter of all britains electricity for the first time ever these findings come from electric insights  research on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by top university academics over the past year the quarterly report has shown breaking renewable records is becoming the new normal for britains electricity last quarter was no different here we look at the key findings from q2 2017 and what they mean for the changing nature of the energy sector more than half great britains electricity came from renewables twice wind solar biomass and hydro accounted for 515 of the uks electricity for an hour on 7 th june  generating 191 gigawatts gw combined with nuclear power and imports from france lowcarbon output was a record 286 gw  a massive 89 of total demand this followed 30 th april when britains electricity edged over the 50 renewable mark for a shorter but no less significant period the percentage of renewables making up our power supply is set to grow as additional renewable capacity comes onto the grid there is currently 6 gw of additional wind capacity being constructed in britain solar capacity has already hit 124 gw  more solar panels than analysts thought would be installed by 2050 plans to convert more of britains coal units to biomass will increase the availability of renewable power further still electricity was cleaner than ever there was a key date in the history of coal during q2 on 21 st april britain recorded the first full day it had gone without burning any coal since 1882  the year holborn viaduct power station became the worlds first coalfired public electricity station while that date is symbolic of the uks shift away from coal in practice it means carbon emissions are also dropping to historically low levels carbon intensity reached a new low in q2 averaging 199 gkwh over the quarter  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year for context carbon intensity averaged 740 gkwh in the 1980s and 500 gkwh in the 2000s an important indicator of this falling carbon intensity is that britains electricity now regularly drops below 100 gkwh and reached an alltime low of 71 gkwh on the sunny and windy sunday of 11 th june electric cars are cleaner than before one of the greatest decarbonisation challenges moving forward is how we transform transport electrification is the primary driver of change in this sector and q2 saw britain hit a significant milestone as the total number of electric vehicles evs in the country surpassed 100000 the potential of evs in cleaning up transport is significant but there are also concerns they could in some cases increase co 2 levels due to pollution from power stations however as the last quarters data shows evs are in fact twice as carbon efficient as conventional cars thanks to the amount of renewable and low carbon electricity on the system according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models evs werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell from imperial college london but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are delivering much better results the most solar power a quarter has ever seen the longer days in q2 enabled solar power to become a key source of electricity  and for eight hours over the quarter it generated more than all fossil fuels combined it also set output records by supplying 25 of total demand on 8 th april and producing 891 gw on 26 th may while wind remains the largest source of renewable energy generation in the uk solars influence is growing  especially as decentralisation of the power system continues to proliferate  of britains 124 gw solar capacity 57 is concentrated in 1400 solar farms of around 5 mw each while the rest is distributed across almost one million rooftop arrays in homes businesses and other institutions in fact during june 10 of all britains electricity came from these sorts of decentralised sources  sources of power not on the national grid this is unlikely to spell a fundamental shift to an entirely decentralised power grid in the short term but it does hint at the changes the sector is seeing from its carbon profile to its variety to its flexibility britains power system is changing  and thats a good thing explore the data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags electricity generation  decarbonisation  investors  electric insights a flexible energy future andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 3 august 2017 opinion renewable technologies now account for a larger proportion of great britains electricity sources than ever before and theyre growing the first quarter of 2017 was another recordbreaking one for renewables biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output draxs own generation is now 68 renewable and accounted for 17 of the countrys overall renewable generation in the first half of 2017  enough to power over four million homes weve made great progress over a relatively short period however with every step forward we need to ensure our approach is helping enhance stability in a power system increasingly made up of intermittent renewables what will become more and more important for security of electricity supply will be technologies that respond quickly to spikes in demand and drops in supply  for example when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing in short what the power system of today needs is flexibility the flexibility factor a recent report by imperial college london for the committee on climate change ccc highlights the significance of increasing systemwide flexibility in achieving decarbonisation imperials analysis emphasises the cost savings this can have projecting that flexibility in a 50 gkwh system  the lowerend of the cccs 2030 target for a decarbonised system  could save between 71 billion and 81 billion a year in system integration costs without flexibility the costs of balancing the system will rise significantly this in turn could lead to the current fastpace of grid decarbonisation stalling the need for flexibility in our energy system is too financially and environmentally significant to ignore but what sources and technologies will we need to create it the next big thing in system flexibility there are a number of technologies that are often touted as key to a flexible system including storage principally batteries interconnectors rapid response gas plants renewable technologies such as biomass and demand side response all are indeed crucial to a flexible future but alone each one still has its challenges millions of pounds are being invested in battery and storage research  both in the ambition of driving down costs and in increasing capacity however there is a way to go on both fronts for example consider the scale at which batteries must operate the storage domes at drax power station hold up to 300 kt of wood pellets  enough to generate roughly 600 gwh of electricity at the current battery prices of around 350 per kwh it would cost 210 billion to replace their capacity with batteries  even if prices fell dramatically we are still talking about a 60 billion price tag greater interconnection is something energy industry regulator ofgem and the national infrastructure commission nic are calling for but national grid has voiced concerns that wholesale market price swings could lead to changes in power flows across interconnectors this in turn could impact great britains system however they remain a potential solution to solving flexibility not just for their ability to deliver power but in their ability to deliver ancillary services  something which will become increasingly important in a more volatile power system for example if built hinkley point c will have some of the biggest single units on the system 1600 mw which will create more demand for ancillary services such as frequency response technologies such as biomass and gas are well placed to provide this as well as quickly respond to changes in demand and supply they also highlight why it is important to consider each megawatt coming onto the system not all technologies offer electricity and system stability tools ancillary services and so each one should be assessed from a whole system cost perspective  and according to how they fit into the overall supply mix each type of generation can bring diverse services so to achieve true flexibility we cant rely on one technology  instead we will need to rely on many better together to achieve full system flexibility we will need a coordinated combination of sources this means maintaining a stable system that includes increasing levels of intermittent renewables and flexible generation sources like biomass and gas that will supply baseload megawatts plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables and provide ancillary services the four rapid response gas power plants we are developing will play a key role once they are consented secure capacity market contracts and become operational in the early 2020s they will be crucial to plugging gaps in power supply as a result of unfavourable weather conditions creating a system that is sufficiently flexible will make britain much more effective in responding to stresses such as very low wind speeds over several hours  unexpected power station unit outages or high demand more than this it will keep us on track to meeting carbonreduction challenges for an affordable decarbonised power system we need to be stable to be stable we need to be flexible and to be flexible we need to be varied and we need to work together tags investors  decarbonisation active management of forests increases growth and carbon storage 28 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy a study on the historical trends in the forest industry of the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the forest2market report found that increased demand for wood is statistically correlated with more annual tree growth more wood volume available in the forest and more timberland for example between 1953 and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical perspective on the relationship between demand and forest

and remains unedited below the uk electricity market used to be simpler coal gas and nuclear plants generated energy and fed power into the national grid  retail companies then delivered that power to homes and businesses across the country thanks to regional distribution network operators  today its not as simple the energy system of great britain has grown more complex  it needed to the push to lower carbon emissions led to the introduction of an array of different power generation technologies and fuels to the energy mix these all generate power in different ways at different times and in different conditions added to this are government schemes that have changed how this is all funded in short our electricity market is now more complex drax group has transformed itself to align with this new system it is now an energy company with complementary operations across its supply chain  sourcing fuel  generating 17 of great britains renewable power and then selling much of that electricity directly to business customers in the retail market  this has fundamentally changed both how we do business and the financial mechanisms behind the business where are we now draxs financial and operating strategies are very much interlinked shifting how we generate energy changes how we generate revenue the company is structured according to a set of distinct business segments each of which is treated in a slightly different way the generation business drax has adapted its business model to the uk governments regulatory framework which through successive administrations has broadly promoted investment in renewable and low carbon power generation three of our six electricity generation units  accounting for 68 of our output in the first half of 2017  have been upgraded from coal to produce renewable electricity from sustainable compressed wood pellets  these units are a core part of britains renewable energy mix guaranteed income from the third unit conversion has given us a significantly higher degree of earnings visibility and reduced our exposure to commodity prices h1 2017 107 twh total generation 73 twh biomass generation our coal generation units no longer provide 247 baseload electricity this means we primarily use our coal generation as a support system when the grid needs it we can ramp up and down coal generation responding to demand and ancillary service needs  our renewable generation units do this too ultimately however our longterm goal is to convert the remaining coal units  either to renewables or to gas our research and innovation team is currently looking into how we might be able to do this but early indications show that coaltogas conversion could be an attractive option for delivering flexible and reliable generation capacity for the uk drax power is doing well and generated 137m of ebitda in the first half of this year a 51m increase compared to the first half of 2016 we are confident about the projected growth of our power generation business to 300 million ebitda by 2025 that plan is aided by our move into rapid response gas  a technology that can meet urgent needs of a power system that includes an increasing amount of weatherdependent renewables two of the four rapid response gas projects were developing are ready to bid for 15year capacity market contracts this coming february they are designed to start up from cold faster than coal and combined cycle gas turbine ccgt units these smallyetpowerful plants will respond to shortterm power market price signals and be capable of providing other ancillary services to further enhance security of supply these projects should add an attractive additional source of earnings to our generation business they also will have attractive characteristics as a significant element of their earnings will come from the capacity market  guaranteed government income for 15 years the retail business we directly serve the retail market through haven power  which supplies renewable electricity primarily to industrial and commercial customers last week we announced that haven power was able to breakeven six months ahead of schedule retail is an area were growing and in february 2017 we acquired opus energy  the largest nondomestic uk energy company by meters installed outside the big six this has had a marked effect  today were the largest challenger b2b energy retailer in the uk there is a healthy and regular annuity coming in through the existing retail business and we believe this can generate 80 million of ebitda by 2025 which together with our growing biomass supply business will make up a third of our earnings we demonstrated good progress in the first half of the year earning 11m of ebitda the biomass business our two operational wood pellet manufacturing plants in louisiana and mississippi are progressing well they are both still ramping up to full production and have seen marked improvements in pellet quality and production we are looking to grow our us business and as part of this well need to build on the recent addition of lasalle bioenergy with further acquisitions expansion will grow our capacity for the selfsupply of pellets from 15 to 30 of drax power stations requirements adding an additional one million tonnes of production in the second half of 2017 we expect the profitability of drax biomass to increase lasalle will be commissioned in the first half of 2018 and reach capacity in 2019 whats next the energy landscape continues to change and well need to change with it phasing out coal entirely is priority number one for this well continue to look at options how and when we can convert more units to sustainable biomass depends on trials that we are conducting at drax power station during 201718 the right government support would also make further conversions cost effective we also recognise that its important to look at alternative possibilities for our remaining coal units this is why we are seeking planning permission to convert one or more of our 645 mw megawatt coal units to 1300 mw of gas such an upgrade would be at a discount to a newbuild combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power station of equivalent capacity and thats simply because we would use much of the existing infrastructure and equipment another major prospect is in the technology space and so were continuing to invest in research and innovation batteries and storage are a huge opportunity for us  both in how they could benefit our retail customers and how they could provide solutions for largescale centralised energy systems in short its an area with huge potential we welcome the governments recent initiatives designed to stimulate the development of battery technology  as well as encourage the use of electric vehicles drax has gone through a period of considerable change and that will continue as we meet the uks lowcarbon energy demands we are improving the quality of our earnings reducing our exposure to commodities and positioning to take advantage of future opportunities as we told investors in june if we deliver on these plans we can expect 425 million of ebitda in 2025  tags will gardiner  electricity generation  investors  gas  supply chain  financial reports how lasers reduce emissions 25 july 2017 power generation of the air that makes up our atmosphere the most abundant elements are nitrogen and oxygen in isolation these elements are harmless but when exposed to extremely high temperatures such as in a power station boiler or in nature such as in lightning strikes they cling together to form nox nox is a collective term for waste nitrogen oxide products  specifically nitric oxide no and nitrogen dioxide no 2   and when released into the atmosphere  they can cause problems like smog and acid rain at a power station where fuel is combusted to generate electricity some nox is inevitable as air is used in boilers to generate heat but it is possible to reduce how much is formed and emitted at drax power station a system installed by siemens is doing just that it begins with a look into swirling clouds of fire not your average fireplace getting rid of nox is at heart a problem of getting combustion temperatures to a point where they are hot enough to burn fuel effectively too hot and the combustion will form excess amounts of nox gases too cool and it wont combust efficiently says julian groganz a process control engineer who helped install the sppap3000 combustion optimisation system at drax combustion temperatures are the result of the given ratio of fuel and air in each spot of the furnace this is our starting point for optimisation an industrial boiler works in a very different way to your average fireplace in draxs boilers the fuel be it compressed wood pellets or coal  is ground up into a fine powder before it enters the furnace this powder has the properties of a gas and is combusted in the boilers the space inside the boiler is filled with swirling clouds of burning fuel dust says groganz ensuring uniform combustion at appropriate temperatures within this burning chamber  a necessary step for limiting nox emissions  becomes rather difficult heat up the cold spots cool down the hotspots if youre looking to balance the heat inside a boiler you need to understand where to intervene the sppap3000 system does this by beaming an array of lasers across the inside of the boiler lasers are used because different gases absorb light at different wavelengths explains groganz by collecting and analysing the data from either end of the lasers  specifically which wavelengths have been absorbed during each beams journey across the boiler  its possible to identify areas within it burning fuel at different rates and potentially producing nox emissions for example some areas may be full of lots of unburnt particles meaning there is a lack of air causing cold spots in the furnace other areas may be burning too hot forcing together nitrogen and oxygen molecules into nox molecules the lasers detect these imbalances and give the system a clear understanding of whats happening inside but knowing this is only half the battle a breath of fresher air the next job is optimising the rate of burning within the boiler so fuel can be burnt more efficiently explains groganz this is achieved by selectively pumping air into the combustion process to areas where the combustion is too poor or limiting air in areas which is too rich if you limit the air being fed into airrich overheated areas temperatures come down which reduces the production of nox gases says groganz if you add air into airpoor cooler areas temperatures go up burning the remaining particles of fuel more efficiently its a twoforone deal not only does balancing temperatures inside the boiler limit the production of nox gases but also improves the overall efficiency of the boiler bringing costs down across the board it even helps limit damage to the materials on the inside the boiler itself thanks to this system and thanks to its increased use of sustainable biomass which naturally produces less nox than coal drax has cut nox emissions by 53 since the solution was installed more than that it is the first biomass power station to install a system of this sophistication at such scale this means it is not just a feat of technical and engineering innovation but one paving the way to a cleaner more efficient future tags coal  investors  wood pellets half year results for the six months ended 30
