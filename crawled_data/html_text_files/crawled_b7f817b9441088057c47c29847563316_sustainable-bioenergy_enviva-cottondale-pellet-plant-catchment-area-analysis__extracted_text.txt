enviva cottondale pellet plant catchment area analysis a stable and maturing forest resource of managed pine and unmanaged hardwood devastated by hurricane damage in 2018 but recovering to prestorm status the drax forestry team assesses the evidence 18 august 2021 sustainable bioenergy the enviva cottondale pellet mill has a production capacity of 760000 metric tonnes of wood pellets annually raw material used by the mill includes a combination of roundwood chips and secondary residuals ie sawdust and shavings with pine accounting for 8090 of total feedstock in october 2018 hurricane michael passed through the centre of the cottondale catchment area causing significant damage to the forest resource with more than 500000 hectares ha of forestland destroyed and an estimated loss of 42 million m 3 of timber equivalent to around 4 times the uk annual production of roundwood this event has had an impact on the data trends for forest inventory growth and harvesting removals  as harvesting levels were increased to salvage as much timber as possible before it became unusable due to decay this can be clearly seen in many of the charts below however these forest areas have been restored and now continue to grow allowing the catchment area to return to its prehurricane trends in the medium term forest area the catchment area around envivas cottondale pellet mill includes 43 million ha of land based on the historical feedstock sourcing patterns of the mill timberland represents 687 295 million ha of the total land area in the cottondale catchment area this has increased slightly since 2000 from 678 and can be considered to have remained stable over this time period there are also around 300000 ha of woodland associated with agricultural land and around 800000 ha of cropland and pastureland forestry is the dominant land use in this catchment area figure 1 figure 1 land area by usage planted pine represents 33 of the timberland area natural pine 20 with 10 mixed stands and the remainder being hardwood forest of which 94 is naturally regenerated figure 2 the breakdown of forest type and species composition has remained relatively stable and largely unchanged over the last 20 years in contrast to other parts of the us south where some natural pine stands have been converted to planted pine the pine and mixed forest areas are actively managed and produce the majority of the timber harvest in the catchment area despite the large area of hardwood forest management and timber production is limited much of this area is classified as bottomland hardwood located alongside rivers streams and creeks and in streamside management zones smzs which restricts active management in addition the proportion of this catchment area located in florida contains a large area of swampland which is largely composed of hardwoods and cannot be actively managed for timber production and is recognised as having important ecological value figure 2 breakdown of forest type volume and growth the overall trend of volume and growth in the cottondale catchment area is of a maturing forest resource and an increasing accumulation of standing volume particularly in the larger forest product classes sawtimber and chipnsaw figure 3 shows that total standing volume increased by 64 million m 3 from 2000 to 2018 with the largest increases in the pine sawtimber and chipnsaw categories in 2018 the devastating impact of hurricane michael caused a substantial reduction in the standing volume across every product category with the total standing volume being reduced by 42 million m 3  this event has had a significant impact on the forest resource and is a primary cause of recent data trends however the overall longterm trend in the catchment area is of maturing forest and increasing inventory this should continue in the longterm once the impact of the hurricane damage has been managed and replacement forest areas begin to mature figure 3 standing volume by product category pine pulpwood inventory increased steadily by around 8 million m 3 from 2000 to 2013 reaching a peak of 49 million m 3  this then declined slightly to 46 million m 3 in 2018 due to the maturing age class of the forest and pulpwood forest growing into the larger size class of chipnsaw and sawtimber forest figure 4 in addition to an increase in pulpwood demand as biomass markets became operational and ramped up production following the hurricane in 2018 the pine pulpwood inventory dropped by more than 10 million m 3  replanting and reforestation of damaged areas will ensure that future pine pulpwood production will increase again once these forests start to mature in the period from 2000 to 2018 pine sawtimber standing volume increased by 415 million m 3 78 and chipnsaw by 196 million m 3 73 indicating a maturing age class and a growing forest resource the 2018 hurricane caused a reduction in standing volume in both of these product categories of 116 and 8 million m 3 respectively 12 and 17 of the 2018 volume however the increasing trend is likely to continue once the forest area recovers figure 4 standing volume by product category the growth drain ratio gdr is the comparison of average annual growth to removals typically harvesting where the growth exceeds removals the gdr will be in excess of 1 and this is considered sustainable where removals exceed growth then the gdr will be less than 1 and this is not sustainable if maintained in the longterm  although in the shortterm this can be a factor of large areas of mature forest with low growth rates and high rates of harvesting short periods of high demand for a particular product or salvage harvesting after a natural disturbance the gdr should be considered over a longer time period to ensure it reflects the longterm trend in the period from 2003 to 2020 the combined gdr for pine products averaged 152 with a high of 184 and a low of 108 figure 5 figure 5 growth to drain ratio by product category the maturing forest resources can be clearly seen from the growth to removals data for each product category average tree sizes getting larger and more pulpwood class stands moving into the larger sawtimber and chipnsaw categories this trend can be seen by comparing the data values from 2003 and 2018 where sawtimber average annual growth increased by 90 16 million m 3  and removals by 41 098 million m 3  chipnsaw growth increased by 73 13 million m 3  whilst removals increased by 160 19 million m 3  pulpwood growth decreased by 75 04 million m 3  whilst removals increased by 63 16 million m 3  over this time period the total annual surplus of pine growth compared to removals averaged 37 million m 3 per year figure 6 figure 6 pine growth and removals by product category and year hardwood sawtimber and pulpwood removals declined by 20 and 40 respectively between 2000 and 2018 whilst growth increased by 23 for hardwood sawtimber and declined by 16 for hardwood pulpwood the average annual hardwood surplus over this time period was 15 million m 3 per year figure 7 figure 7 hardwood growth and removals by product category and year despite a shortterm imbalance in some product categories the overall surplus of pine growth compared to removals has remained strong with an average of 33 million m 3 between 2000 and 2020 which includes the increased salvage harvesting in 2018 figure 8 figure 8 cumulative annual surplus of growth compared to removals wood prices stumpage price is the value paid to the forest owner for each category of product at the time of harvesting the variation in prices in the cottondale catchment area has been significant and shows some interesting trends the higher value pine products sawtimber and chipnsaw began with high stumpage values in 2000 as markets were strong for construction and furniture grade timber and supply limited at that stage due to the young age class and predominance of pulpwood stands at that time in 2008 following the global economic crisis and the crash in housing and construction markets sawtimber prices declined substantially reaching a low of 23 per ton a 47 decline from the 2000 price this stumpage price has never recovered despite an improvement in the economy and an increase in housing starts and demand for structural timber the reason for the continued deflated sawtimber stumpage price is a substantial surplus of supply in this catchment area as the forest area has matured and more sawtimber grade stands are available markets have been able to satisfy demand without an increase in price pine pulpwood prices at cottondale were lower than the us southwide average in 2000 and remained relatively low until around 2013 a reduction in sawtimber production and consequent reduction in mill residuals due to the recession of 2008 led to a shortage of pulp mill feedstock and increased harvesting of pulpwood stands this caused an increase in pine pulpwood stumpage values alongside an overall increase in demand as biomass and pellet markets began production around this time the data shows a shortterm spike in pine pulpwood stumpage prices in 201314 but this returned to a more normal trend as more sawtimber residues became available and pulpwood stumpage values have been around 1011 per ton since 2015 figure 9 figure 9 variation in stumpage value over time biomass demand biomass demand in the cottondale catchment area began in 2008 and has averaged around 800 thousand m 3 per year since that time with a high of just over 1 million m 3 in 2013 to 2015 and a low of 200 thousand m 3 in 2008 other pulpwood markets have had an average annual demand of 397 million m 3 between 2000 and 2020 with a high of 476 million m 3 in 2018 and a low of 32 million m 3 in 2009 in 2020 the biomass market represented 16 of the total pulpwood demand in the cottondale catchment area figure 10 figure 10 total pulpwood demand forest management the average size of clearcut harvesting sites from 2000 to 2020 has been 47 ha ranging from 38 ha up to 56 ha the average size of thinning sites has been 65 ha ranging from 55 ha up to 76 ha when isolating the period from 2000 to 2010 and 2011 to 2020 the averages and range remain very similar suggesting that there has been no significant change in harvesting coupe size over this period figure 11 average size of harvesting sites the impact of biomass and wood pellet demand on the key metrics in this catchment area are considered below this is a summary of hood consultings view on the trends and impacts in the cottondale catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows a 55166hectare 19 increase in the total area of timberland in the enviva cottondale catchment area since the enviva cottondale pellet mill commenced production in 2008 furthermore a strong positive relationship was identified between biomass demand and timberland area suggesting that the increase in timberland area since 2008 can be linked to a degree to increased demand attributed to bioenergy a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however the evidence is inconclusive as to whether increased demand attributed to bioenergy has caused or is responsible for these changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that thinnings accounted for 63 of total reported harvest area in the cottondale market from 20052011 but only 39 of total harvest area reported from 20122020 specifically the decreased prevalence of thinning since 2012 can be linked to the strengthening of pine pulpwood markets and concurrent weakening of pine sawtimber markets beginning in the mid2000s prior to the bursting of the us housing bubble in 2006 timber management in this market had been driven to a large degree by pine sawtimber production however challenging market conditions saw pine sawtimber stumpages prices decline more than 40 from 20062011 at the same time pine pulpwood markets started to strengthen with pine pulpwood stumpage prices increasing more than 50 from 20062010 so with sawtimber markets weakening and pulpwood markets strengthening the data suggests that many landowners decided to alter their management approach ie to take advantage of strong pulpwood markets and focus on short pulpwood rotations that typically do not utilize thinnings bioenergy has had an impact on this market by adding an average of roughly 680000 metric tons of additional pine pulpwood demand to this catchment area annually since 2008 however bioenergy has accounted for only 17 of total softwood pulpwood demand in this market since enviva cottondales startup ultimately the shift in management approach that occurred in this market can be more closely linked to other factors such as increased softwood pulpwood demand from nonbioenergy sources ie pulppaper as well as the weakening of pine sawtimber markets diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 23 in the cottondale catchment area from 20082020 also there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused a diversion from other softwood pulpwood markets ie pulppaper as softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has increased 25 since the cottondale mills startup in 2008 an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices inconclusive the startup of enviva cottondale added more than 900000 metric tons of softwood pulpwood demand to the catchment area from 20082013 and this increase in demand coincided with a 28 increase in the delivered price of pine pulpwood ppw  the primary roundwood product consumed by the enviva cottondale mill however since 2013 delivered ppw prices have held flat despite biomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand falling to an average of roughly 635000 tons per year since 2016 down more than 40 compared to 2013 peak levels note the decrease in roundwood consumption was due to a higher utilization of secondary residuals its also important to point out that the roughly 410000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand from 2013 to 2020 was offset by a roughly 455000metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand from other sources statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however that relationship was found to be relatively weak the relationship between delivered ppw price and softwood pulpwood demand from other sources was found to be much stronger which was not unexpected to find given that softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 83 of total softwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2008 furthermore there is some evidence linking the increase in pine sawmill chip prices to increased consumption of secondary pine residuals by enviva cottondale specifically consumption of secondary pine residuals by enviva cottondale more than doubled from roughly 213000 metric tons in 2012 to nearly 490000 metric tons in 2016 and this increased consumption of pine residuals coincided with a nearly 20 increase in the price of pine sawmill chips however increased consumption of residuals by the bioenergy sector was only one of several contributing factors that can be linked to the increase in pine sawmill chip prices increased consumption of pine residuals by the pulppaper industry also contributed to higher pine sawmill chip prices in addition there is a strong linkage between pine sawmill chip prices and softwood lumber production specifically the increase in softwood lumber production that begun in the earlytomid2010s consequently resulted in the increased production of secondary residuals and the increased availability of this lowercost material led to greater competition and ultimately higher pine residual prices a reduction in growing stock timber no from 2008 the year enviva cottondale commenced production up until hurricane michael struck in late2018 total growing stock inventory increased an average of 18 per year 19 total in the cottondale catchment area specifically inventories of pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw increased 58 and 28 respectively while pine pulpwood ppw inventory decreased 4 over this same period however note that the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory from 20082018 was not due to increased demand from bioenergy or increased harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area as annual growth of pine pulpwood exceeded annual removals every year throughout this period rather this slight decrease in ppw inventory levels is more a reflection of the aging of the catchment area forest and the movement of stands classified as pulpwood to stands classified as chipnsaw a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service usfs data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber in the cottondale catchment area decreased from 59 in 2008 to 52 in 2020 suggesting that the sequestration rate of carbon also declined slightly over this period however there is little evidence to suggest that increased demand attributed to bioenergy is responsible for this change the reduction in overall growth rate and therefore reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon is more a reflection of the aging of the catchment area forest specifically growth rates decline as timber ages and this is exactly what usfs data shows in the cottondale catchment area with the average age of growing stock timber increasing from less than 44 years of age in 2008 to nearly 46 years of age in 2020 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual timber removals provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2020 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood ppw the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 126 recall that a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels note however that the ppw gr ratio averaged 157 in the catchment area from 20132017 before falling to 120 in 2018 and averaging 127 since this notable drop in 2018 was due to a nearly 35 increase in ppw removals due to hurricane michael its also important to note that while annual removals have moved back in line with premichael levels since 2019 this lower ppw gr ratio is likely reflective of the new norm at least over the midterm hurricane michael destroyed an estimated 22 of total pine pulpwood inventory in the cottondale catchment area and this loss in inventory will be reflected in reduced growth until the destroyed forests regenerate however in spite of this loss adequate ppw inventory levels still remain and sustainable market conditions are expected to persist moving forward timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood ppw decreased 25 in the catchment area from 20082020 however this substantial decrease was due to hurricane michael which destroyed nearly 520000 hectares of catchment area timberland when it hit the florida panhandle in late2018 prior to this event occurring ppw inventory levels had held relatively steady decreasing slightly but averaging 472 million m3 in the catchment area from 20082018 however the destruction caused by hurricane michael resulted in the immediate loss of more than 103 million m3 of ppw inventory or a 22 decrease compared to prehurricane levels moreover the slight decrease in ppw inventory levels that did occur from 20082018 was not due to increased demand from bioenergy typically a reduction in inventory is linked to harvest levels above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area but in the cottondale catchment area annual growth of ppw exceeded annual removals every year throughout this period ultimately the decrease in ppw inventory from 20082018 can be more closely linked to decreased pine sawtimber production beginning in the early to mid2000s specifically annual removals of pine sawtimber decreased 28 from 20032014 and the reduction in harvest levels over this period translated to a reduction in newlyreestablished pine stands and ultimately the slight reduction in ppw inventory levels that occurred in the midtolate 2010s timber growth rates neutral overall timber growth rates declined slightly in the catchment area from 2008 the year enviva cottondale commenced operations through 2020 however this decrease in timber growth rates was not due to increased demand attributed to bioenergy but rather to the aging of the catchment area forest specifically usfs data shows the average age timber inventory in the cottondale catchment area increased from an estimated 436 years of age in 2008 to 457 years of age in 2020 forest area positive in the enviva cottondale catchment area total forest area ie timberland increased more than 55100 hectares 19 from 2008 through 2020 and this increase can be linked to several factors including increases in softwood pulpwood demand from both bioenergy and other sources as well as conversion from farmland specifically the more than 55100hectare increase in catchment area timberland from 20082020 coincided with a 11million metric ton increase in annual softwood pulpwood demand roughly half of which was attributed to bioenergy while statistical analysis identified moderately strong positive relationships between timberland area and both softwood biomass demand and nonbioenergyrelated softwood pulpwood demand a strong positive correlation was found between timberland and total softwood pulpwood demand  suggesting that the increases in timberland since 2008 can be attributed in part to the increase in total softwood pulpwood demand from both bioenergy and other sources the more than 55100hectare increase timberland from 20082020 also coincided with a roughly 75000hectare decrease in farmland ie cropland woodland and pastureland over this period specifically the catchment area experienced a roughly 31800hectare loss in cropland 8900hectare loss in pastureland and 34300hectare loss in woodland from 20082020 furthermore statistical analysis confirmed this inverse relationship identifying a strong negative correlation between timberland and farmland in the cottondale catchment area wood prices negative  positive total softwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy in the cottondale catchment area increased from zero tons in 2007 the year prior to enviva cottondales startup to over 10 million metric tons in 2013 over this same period the price of delivered pine pulpwood ppw  the predominant roundwood product utilized by enviva cottondale for wood pellet production  increased 42 from 2106 per ton in 2007 to 2982 per ton in 2013 however the apparent link between increased softwood biomass demand and increased delivered ppw price is only loosely supported by statistical analysis which identified a relatively weak positive relationship between these two variables furthermore delivered ppw price has remained nearly unchanged in the catchment area since 2013 despite softwood biomass demand declining and averaging roughly 577000 metric tons per year since 2016 note that the roughly 410000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand from 20132020 was offset by a roughly 455000metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand from other sources ultimately the increase in delivered ppw prices in the catchment area can be linked to increased demand for softwood pulpwood from all sources and roughly half of the 12million metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand since 2007 can be attributed to bioenergy however its also important to note that the increase in bioenergyrelated wood demand has been a positive for forest landowners in the enviva cottondale catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood in this market but the increase in delivered ppw price resulting from increased softwood pulpwood demand from bioenergy has transferred through to landowners in the form of higher ppw stumpage prices specifically over the six years prior to enviva cottondales startup ppw stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  averaged roughly 740 per ton in the cottondale catchment area however since 2010 ppw stumpage prices have averaged more than 1115 per ton representing a more than 50 increase compared to premill startup levels markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva cottondale catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased an estimated 23 from 20082020 this increase in softwood lumber production has consequentially resulted in an increase in sawmill residuals ie chips sawdust and shavings  byproducts of the sawmilling process and materials utilized by enviva cottondale to produce wood pellets specifically softwood sawlog demand has increased more than 16 in the catchment area since 2014 and this increase in demand has coincided with a nearly 60 increase in pine residual purchases by enviva cottondale note that pine residuals constituted 25 of total raw material purchases by enviva cottondale in 2014 but 41 of total raw material purchases in 2020 so not only has enviva cottondale benefited from the greater availability of this sawmill byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as enviva cottondale has provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts read the full
