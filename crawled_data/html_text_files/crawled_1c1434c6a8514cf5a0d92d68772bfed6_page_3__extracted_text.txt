sustainability the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 13 april 2021 opinion today we completed a transformational deal  our acquisition of canadian biomass pellet producer pinnacle renewable energy im very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas we are determined to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass and deliver beccs  the negative emissions technology that will be needed around the world to meet global climate targets the acquisition of pinnacle takes us a big step forward in achieving our goals read press release drax completes acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc tags biomass

opinion will gardiner opened the second day of the chatham house energy transitions conference  watch his keynote address below or scroll down the page to read his speech in full the energy transition is central to our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future drax has been at the heart of britains energy system for decades and we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector drax power station in selby north yorkshire is the uks largest power station and europes largest decarbonisation project cruachan our scottish pumped storage facility is a key complement to britains ever increasing supply of offshore wind our transition from coal to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the uk this month saw the end of commercial coal generation at drax power station  a milestone in the history of our company and of the uk economy too but the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here which is why we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon water outlet into loch awe from cruachan power station today we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with one ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster  the benefits are enormous beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change expert bodies such as the climate change committee here in the uk and the ipcc at a global level are clear that we need negative emissions technologies including beccs to reach net zero and beccs is central to the uk and europes decarbonisation plans as the worlds largest and most experienced generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to pioneer beccs than at drax the economic social and environmental benefits are enormous beccs at drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help heavy industry in the uks largest emitting area decarbonise quickly and cost effectively it will enable the creation of tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england levelling up the economy and delivering a green recovery from the covid crisis and it will put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to develop carbon removal technology in this the year that we host cop26 in glasgow the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here a proven technology we know that beccs works and that the technology is available now looking at cost projections from the ccc we also know that it is the best value negative emissions technology engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station we have already successfully run two beccs pilots at the power station in 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock and in 2020 we began a second pilot working with mitsubishi heavy industries to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions we aim to deploy beccs at scale by 2027 to that end earlier this month we kickstarted the planning process for our proposals to build our first beccs units  marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 the support we need drax power station has a proud history of transformation and today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future the core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close partnership with government  and it is this partnership that will make beccs a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it an effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as drax we believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months with cop26 later this year making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the uk beccs in context but we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen beccs will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero click to read thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago a partnership with our stakeholders the purpose of todays session is to discuss all these issues and more our aim is clear to enable a successful energy transition at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england but i want your help in making beccs as sustainable and successful as it can be we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests thank you very much for listening and i wish you a good and constructive session tackling this critical global challenge will gardiner

october last year several of our employees from policy managers to apprentices took over the energy uk young energy professional yep forums twitter account to share their experiences so far working in the energy industry and their roles at drax the yep forum consists of a network of energy industry professionals with less than 10 years experience and aims to provide them with opportunities to collaborate develop and recognise successes the following insights from employees at drax show the importance of our workforce in achieving our ambition and what they have learnt so far about starting a career in the energy industry engineer working in the turbine hall at drax power station north yorkshire meet samuel the apprentice one of our technical apprentices samuel plumb explains why he decided to kickstart his career with a drax apprenticeship plus what the selection process involves i applied for this role because its a mix of practical skills and problemsolving drax has a large site with a huge range of equipment and processes so no two days are the same working here appealed to me because im really interested in the power industry and drax plays a key role in generation i found out about this apprenticeship through online research submitted an application completed aptitude tests online sat another aptitude test onsite and then eventually attended an interview meet richard the policy manager richard gow explains that with the right policies in place drax could become a carbon negative power station enabling a zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region the drax group policy and government relations manager outlines how his role helps to develop the necessary frameworks i engage with policymakers advisors and experts across the uk to understand the policy and political landscape and how this could impact draxs commercial objectives the energy sector is at the forefront of decarbonisation and its exciting to be involved in developing policies and market frameworks to support this transition to net zero by investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen and other green technologies in the humber industry can regain a competitive edge new jobs can help to rejuvenate communities and the wider region as evidenced by a recent report from vivid economics on the socioeconomic benefits of beccs this investment at drax supports the uks levelling up agenda and to build back better  emphasising the need for the uk to have a skilled workforce to achieve net zero will gardiner ceo of drax group has explained how our own ambitions will also boost our communities and local economies by helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses noting that beccs at drax is not just limited to new engineering or technician roles as a ukus company with sites from selby to the scottish highlands to louisiana and mississippi in the us south we

listen to webcast tags biomass energy  sustainability  customers  about us  investors  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage what is renewable energy 17 december 2020 sustainable bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore wind 29 the worlds largest power station of any kind  the three gorges dam in china runs on a renewable energy source hydropower and has a generation capacity of 225 gigawatts gw the total capacity of the worlds installed renewable electricity generation is

by hectares affected than forestry activity chart via natural government of canada the pinnacle pellet mills at burns lake and houston were established alongside the sawmills to utilise the sawmill residues as there were no other viable markets for this material these sawmills draw fibre from a large distance up to 300 miles away therefore the size of the catchment area in this piece of analysis is determined by the sourcing practices of the sawmills rather than the economic viability of low grade roundwood transport to the pellet mill see figure 1 damage to pine trees by mountain pine beetle mpb utilising forest residues the two mills producing highdensity biomass pellets have provided an essential outlet for residue material that would otherwise have no other market and until very recently were supplied almost entirely by mill residuals as the quantity of dead and dying timber has reduced and sawmill production has declined the pellet mills are beginning to utilise more lowgrade roundwood and forest residues that are otherwise heaped and burned at roadside following harvest to supplement the sawmill coproducts primarily state owned managed forests the total land area in the catchment for burns lake and houston is 447 million hectares ha of which 375 million ha is classed as forest land 94 of the catchment area is public land under provincial jurisdiction the provincial forest service is responsible for all decisions on land use and forest management on public land in consultation with communities and indigenous groups determining which areas are suitable for timber production and which areas require protection approximately 34 of the catchment area is not available for commercial timber harvesting because it is either nonforested or it has low productivity and other operational challenges or it is protected for ecological and wildlife reasons the chief forester for the province sets the annual allowable cut aac which determines the quantity of timber that can be harvested each year ordinarily this will be based on the sustainable yield capacity of the working forest area but in recent years the mpb damage has necessitated a significant increase in aac to facilitate the salvage of areas that have been attacked and damaged see figure 2 figure 2 changes in annual allowable cut 1980 to 2018 source nadina district flnrord click to viewdownload the catchment area is in the montane cordillera ecozone and the canadian forest service reports that between 1980 and 2017 the area of forest in the ecozone declined from 31181000 ha to 31094000 ha a decline of 87000 ha or 028  of the forest area deforestation in the catchment area was estimated at 300 ha per year most deforestation in the ecozone occurred because of conversion to agriculture as well as other contributing factors such as mining urban expansion and road construction including forest roads the forest area is dominated by coniferous species see figure 3 predominantly lodgepole pine spruce and fir 90 of the total area with hardwood species primarily aspen making up just 8 of the total area figure 3 species composition of forest land in the catchment area managing beetle damaged areas the annual harvest volume was at a peak in the early part of the last decade at over 12 million m 3 in 2011 this has now declined by around 45 million m 3 in 2019 see figure 4 as the beetle damaged areas are cleared and replanted the aac and harvesting levels are expected to be reduced in the future to allow the forest to regrow and recover figure 4 annual change in harvest volume of major species future increases in forest growth rates historically the forest area has naturally regenerated with selfseeded stands reaching a climax of mature pine spruce and abies fir mixtures as the forest matured it would often be subject to natural fires or other disturbance which would cause the cycle to begin again following the increase in harvesting of beetle damaged areas many forests are now replanted with mixtures of spruce and pine rather than naturally regenerated this is likely to lead to an increase in forest growth rates in the future and a higher volume of timber availability once the areas reach maturity see figure 5 figure 5 forecast of future volume production timber markets in the catchment area are limited in comparison to other regions like the us south the scale of the landscape and the inaccessible nature of many of the forest areas limit the viability of access to multiple markets sawmills produce the highest value endproduct and these markets have driven the harvesting of forest tracts for many years concessions to harvest timber are licensed either by volume or for a specific area from the provincial forest service this comes with a requirement to ensure that the forest regrows and is appropriately managed after harvesting there are no pulp mills within the catchment area and limited alternative markets for the lowest grades of roundwood or sawmill residuals other than the pellet mills consequently the pellet mills have a close relationship with the sawmills wood price trends prices for standing timber on public land are determined by the provincial government using results from public timber sales and set according to the species and quality of timber produced from the highestgrade logs through to forest residuals the lack of market diversity and challenging logistics mean that there is little competition for mill residuals and lowgrade fibre the price differential in endproduct value between sawtimber and wood pellets ensures that fibre suitable for sawmill utilisation does not get processed by the pellet mill a very small volume of larger dimension material can end up in a low value market when there are quality issues that limit the value for sawtimber eg rotten core structural defects but this represents a very small proportion of the supply volume there is no evidence that pellet mills have displaced other markets within this catchment area read the full report catchment area analysis pinnacle renewable energys burns lake  houston mills  this is part of a series of

that it has completed the refinancing of its revolving credit facility the new 300 million facility the facility matures in 2025 with an option to extend by one year 1  the facility replaces the current rcf which matures in 2021 and provides increased liquidity enabling the full facility to be drawn as cash the previous facility restricted cash drawn to support liquidity to 165 million the facility is currently undrawn for cash the facility has a customary margin grid referenced over libor which reflects a small reduction in cost versus the current rcf and includes an embedded esg component which adjusts the margin based on draxs carbon intensity measured against an annual benchmark drax has also agreed a change to the groups 35 million termloan facility maturing in 2022 in order to simplify its capital structure this facility will now rank as senior previously super senior drawing of previously agreed infrastructure facility on 14 september 2020 drax confirmed that it
