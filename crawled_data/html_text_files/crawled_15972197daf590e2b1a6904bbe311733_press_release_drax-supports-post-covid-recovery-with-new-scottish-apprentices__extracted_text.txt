it has been a very uncertain time for young people like me looking to start their careers over the last few months because of covid to not only secure an engineering apprenticeship but one based at draxs daldowie plant is incredibly exciting this is the second time drax has invested in apprenticeships at its scottish sites since it acquired them as part of a wider portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable assets at the start of last year the continued investment in young people has been welcomed by the scottish government jamie hepburn skills minister said as we recover from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic it is vital that we continue to develop scotlands young workforce to equip people with the skills they need to succeed while meeting the emerging needs and opportunities of our employers and economy apprenticeships are not only valuable for our young people they are a fantastic way for all employers to invest in their workforce and provide the skills the economy needs now and in the future i am delighted that drax continues to nurture new talent by appointing apprentices as part of its commitment to stem skills and training i would also like to take this opportunity to wish all those starting out in a new career the very best draxs technical apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers it is a fouryear programme and specialises in three engineering disciplines mechanical electrical and control  instrumentation this years apprentices at draxs scottish sites

across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax supplies energy to 250000 businesses across england scotland and wales pellet
