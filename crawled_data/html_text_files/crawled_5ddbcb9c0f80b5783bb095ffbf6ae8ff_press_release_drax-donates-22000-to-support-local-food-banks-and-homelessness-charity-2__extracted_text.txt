and we currently have around 900 people relying on us we are so grateful for the support weve received from drax  donations like these are vital to the work we do to help hundreds of people in goole and the surrounding areas every year the remaining 10000 was donated to the charity shelter after drax employees chose to give the money to charity instead of receiving a festive hamper shelter

important that we and other businesses do so now more than ever as people are struggling with the ongoing cost of living crisis i hope these donations will help ease some of the costs for the food banks and that the generosity of draxs employees will help shelter to deliver their vital services to those most in need of safe housing especially during the colder months drax is committed to
