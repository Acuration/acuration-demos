energy policy why we need the whole country on the same frequency 23 june 2017 power generation the modern world sits on a volatile fizzing web of electricity in 2015 the uk consumed roughly 303 terawatt hours twh of electricity according to government statistics  thats an awful lot of power humming around and in this country we take it for granted that electricity is controlled this means the power supply coming into your home or place of work is reliable and wont trip your fuse box in short it means your mobile phone will keep on charging and your washing machine will keep on spinning but generating and circulating electricity at safe usable levels is not an easy task one of the most overlooked aspects of doing this is electrical frequency  and how its regulated what is electrical frequency to understand the importance of frequency we need to understand a couple of important things about power generation generators work by converting the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine into electrical energy in a steamdriven generator like those at drax power station  high pressure steam turns a turbine which turns a rotor mounted inside a stator copper wire is wound around the rotor energised with electricity this turns it into an electromagnet with a north and south pole the stator is made up of large heavy duty copper bars which enclose the rotor as the rotor turns its magnetic field passes through the copper bars and induces an electric current which is sent out onto the transmission system as the magnetic field has a north and south pole the copper bars experience a change in direction of the magnetic field each time the rotor turns this makes the electric current change direction twice per revolution and is called an alternating current ac there are in fact three sets of copper bars in the stator producing three electrical outputs or phases termed red yellow and blue electrical frequency is the measure of the rate of that oscillation and is measured in the number of changes per second  also called hertz hz a generator running at 3000 rpm  with two magnetic poles produces electricity at a frequency of 50hz why is this important maintaining a consistent electrical frequency is important because multiple frequencies cannot operate alongside each other without damaging equipment this has serious implications when providing electricity at a national scale the exact figure is less important than the need to keep frequency stable across all connected systems in great britain the grid frequency is 50hz in the us its 60hz in japan the western half of the country runs at 60hz and the eastern half of the country runs at 50hz  a string of power stations across the middle of the country steps up and down the frequency of the electricity as it flows between the two grids sticking to one national frequency is a team effort every generator in england scotland and wales connected to the high voltage transmission system is synchronised to every other generator when the output of any of the three phases  the red yellow or blue  is at a peak the output from all other phases of the same colour on every other generating unit in great britain is also at a peak they are all locked together  synchronised  to form a single homogenous supply which provides stability and guaranteed quality how is frequency managed the problem is frequency can be difficult to control  if the exact amount of electricity being used is not matched by generation it can affect the frequency of the electricity on the grid for example if theres more demand for electricity than there is supply frequency will fall if there is too much supply frequency will rise to make matters more delicate theres a very slim margin of error in great britain anything just 1 above or below the standard 50hz risks damaging equipment and infrastructure  see how far the countrys frequency is currently deviating from 50 hz  managing electrical frequency falls to a countrys high voltage transmission system operator the national grid in the uk the grid can instruct power generators like drax to make their generating units automatically respond to changes in frequency if the frequency rises the turbine reduces its steam flow if it falls it will increase changing the electrical output  a change that needs to happen in seconds in the case of generating units at drax power station the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension which minimises large frequency swings frequency on a fastchanging system not all power generation technologies are suited for providing high quality frequency response roles and as the uk transitions to a lowercarbon economy ancillary services such as stabilisation of frequency are becoming more important neither solar nor wind can be as easily controlled its possible to regulate wind output down or hold back wind turbines to enable upward frequency response when there is sufficient wind similarly solar panels can be switched on and off to simulate frequency response as solar farms are so widely dispersed and tend to be embedded  meaning they operate outside of the national system it is not as easy for national grid to instruct and monitor them both wind and solar have no inertia so the allimportant damping effect is missing too using these intermittent or weatherdependent power generation technologies to help manage frequency can be expensive compared to thermal power stations nor are the current fleet of nuclear reactors flexible  nuclear reactors in great britain were designed to run continuously at high loads known as a baseload power although they cannot deliver frequency response services the countrys nuclear power stations do provide inertia twenty times faster thermal power generation technologies such as renewable biomass or fossil fuels such as coal and gas are ideal for frequency response services at scale because they can be easily dialled up or down as both the fuel supply to their boilers and steam within their turbines can be regulated the 645 mw thermal power units at drax have the capability to respond to the grids needs in as little as half a second or less complete their change in output in under one second and maintain their response for many minutes or even hours before the introduction of high volumes of wind and solar generation almost all generators excluding nuclear running on the system could provide frequency response as these generators are increasingly replaced by intermittent technologies the system operator must look for new services to maintain system stability an example is national grids recent enhanced frequency response tender which asked for a solution that can deliver frequency stabilisation in under a second  20 times faster than the primary response provided by existing thermal power stations drax was the only participating thermal power station however all contracts were all won by battery storage projects frequency future given the decline in fossil fuel generation and uncertainty around our power makeup in future decades national grid is consulting on how best to source services such as frequency response the ideal scenario for national grid is one where services can be increasingly sourced from reliable flexible and affordable forms of low carbon generation or demand response the next generation of nuclear power stations as with some already operating in france can provide frequency response services however the first of the new crop hinkley c is around a decade away from being operational  likewise solar or wind coupled with battery molten salt or flywheel storage will provide an increasing level of flexibility in the decades ahead as storage costs come down thanks to power generation at drax with compressed wood pellets  a form of sustainable biomass britain has already begun moving into an era where lower carbon frequency response can begin to form the foundation of a more reliable and cleaner system this

may 2017 power generation more of britains electricity is coming from renewables than ever before new offshore wind farms solar capacity hitting double figures and the reliability of biomass are having a marked effect on the countrys power our electricity make up is more diverse than ever more than this it is cleaner during the first three months of 2017 emissions from power generation were 10 lower than the same period last year and 33 lower than the first quarter of 2015 and while this is a huge and necessary step in the uks efforts towards slowing global warming it would mean little if renewables werent also keeping our lights on thats exactly what they are doing  powering businesses industries and homes across the country but how many exactly the scale of renewables in 2015 the total electricity consumption of the uk was 303 twh  to put that into perspective thats roughly enough power to boil 1211 billion kettles a quarter of the 360 twh of electricity generated that year came from renewables  84 twh  a massive 29 increase over 2014 of that figure draxs biomass units contributed 115 twh  approximately 3 of that years total power generation so renewables are big but how big according to the 2011 census there are 264 million households in the uk ofgem the energy regulator says the average uk household uses roughly 31 mwh of electricity a year the average us household uses approximately 108 mwh  if we were to hypothesise that all the renewable power generated in 2015 had been consumed by uk households there would be enough to power every single one and thered be enough left over to power 600000 more using just the power generated thanks to sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets at drax power station would be enough to satisfy the equivalent of 41 million homes  nearly twice the number of households in scotland or 800000 more homes than in the whole of london 15 of all uk homes could have been powered by just half that one station in selby north yorkshire finding the right mix for the future electricity is used to power more than just homes it powers businesses transport and infrastructure  almost all parts of our lives are fuelled by electricity while there may be the hypothetical equivalent to power every single household in the uk with renewables with room to spare the reality is there is a far larger nationwide demand that needs to be fulfilled and this means we cant rely on renewables alone instead whats required is an energy mix that also includes other low carbon sources of electricity  backed up by a new fleet of gas power stations and storage that can respond rapidly to changes in demand while were not yet in a position where we can power all homes all the time using renewables that day could well be coming a new report from the international renewable energy agency irea suggests a mix of renewable technologies including biomass and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could meet the majority of global energy demand across all sectors of the world economy by 2050  while helping to keep the rise in global temperatures to under two degrees celsius above 1990 levels tags biomass energy  energy policy  about us why you shouldnt be surprised by another recordbreaking quarter for renewable energy 11 may 2017 power generation its been another recordbreaking quarter for britains power system during the first three months of 2017 biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output and while this is all worth celebrating it shouldnt come as a surprise  the last few years have seen britains power system take several significant steps toward decarbonisation and this year is no different electric insights the quarterly report on britains power system by dr iain staffell from imperial college london commissioned by drax via imperial consultants documents the new gains and confirms the trend renewables are fast becoming the new norm and in 2017 they continued their growth the renewable record breakers over this quarter biomass electricity generation hit a record production figure of 44 twh which means that biomass generators ran at 95 of full capacity  higher than any other technology has achieved over the last decade hydro went 4 better than its previous energy production best by generating 16 twh while britains wind farms produced 113 twh 10 higher than the previous record set in 2015 this was helped in part by several new farms being built which increased installed capacity by 5 over last year but it was also indebted to the mild windy weather wind farms produced more electricity than coal 57 days out of 90 during the first three months of 2017 solar hit a new record peak output at the end of march when it generated 767 gw  enough to power a fifth of the country in fact during the last weekend of march for the first time ever the countrys demand for electricity from the national grid was lower during an afternoon than during the night this was because solar panels which only generate power when the sun is up tend to sit outside of the national high voltage transmission grid understanding how this happened is to understand how solar energy is changing our national power system a reverse of the trend electricity demand on the national grid  think of it as the power systems motorways  is typically higher during the day and early evening when people are most active using lights and gadgets than overnight however on the last weekend in march 2017 the opposite was true because of how much solar energy was generated solar panels and some smaller onshore windfarms are invisible  they dont feed into the national grid instead these sources either feed into the regional electricity distribution networks  the power systems a and b roads  or as many of them are on peoples roofs and used in their own homes or business premises it never gets down their driveway this can mean when solar panels are generating a lot of electricity there is a lower demand for power from the grid making it appear that less of the country is using electricity than it actually is this was the case during the last weekend of march when solar generated enough power to satisfy a large part of britains demand and while this is another positive step towards a lower carbon energy mix it is about to change the way our power system works particularly when it comes to the remaining coal power stations what the power system needs to provide today and in the future is flexibility  to ramp up and down to accommodate for the shifting demand based on supply of intermittent  weather dependent  renewables thermal power stations such as gas coal and biomass can meet much of this demand but even more rapid response from technologies such as the open cycle gas turbines that drax is developing and batteries could fulfil these needs quicker todays dirty is yesterdays clean the record breaking and increased renewable generation of the period from january to march 2017 would mean nothing if it wasnt matched by a decrease in emissions during the first three months of 2017 emissions dropped 10 lower than the same period in 2016 and a massive 33 lower than 2015 coal output alone fell 30 this quarter compared to q1 2016 to put the scale of this progress into context we need only look at the quarters dirtiest hour  the hour in which carbon intensity from electricity generation is at its highest between january and march it peaked on a calm and cold january evening with 424 grams of co 2

march 2017 sustainable bioenergy of all the changes to drax power station over the last decade perhaps the biggest is one you cant see since converting three of its six generating units from coal to run primarily on compressed wood pellets  drax has reduced those units greenhouse gas ghg emissions by over 80  and while this is a huge improvement it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isnt sustainably sourced  for this reason drax works with internationallyrecognised certification programmes that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental social and economic criteria thanks to these certification programmes drax can be confident it is not only reducing ghg emissions but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced sustainability certifications the compressed wood pellets used at drax power station come from various locations around the world so drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes the three main ones being the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council  fsc   1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc the programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management but adoption rates vary by region european landowners and regulators are most familiar with the fsc and national pefc standards while north american landowners generally prefer sfi and american tree farm system also members of the pefc family in instances in which drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications or in instances in which drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable over 50 of the pellets used at drax power station come from the southern usa  where sfi and american tree farm system are the most widely implemented certification programmes overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest however the sfi offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by woodprocuring entities such as sawmills pulp mills and pellet mills this programme is referred to as sfi fiber sourcing and to obtain it participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources these sources may or may not include certified forests the programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity water quality landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals together these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides drax with a significant proportion of its pellets and since the sfi and atfs programmes are endorsed by pefc north american suppliers have a pathway for their regions sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by european stakeholders these certification programmes have been in use for many years but with recent growth in the market for wood pellets a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass new kid on the block the sustainable biomass program sbp was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources but rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes it builds on them for example sbp recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes however the pefc sfi and fsc programmes do not include requirements for reporting ghg emissions a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to european regulators sbp fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets when a new entity such as a wood pellet manufacturer first seeks certification under sbp that entity is required to assess its supply base feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme sfi fsc   pefc or pefc approved schemes is considered sbpcompliant all other feedstock must be evaluated against sbp criteria and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 sbp indicators if during the process a specific risk is identified for example to the forest ecosystem the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded these assessments are audited by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee in conducting the risk assessment the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes sustainable energy for the uk counting major energy companies including dong energy eon and drax as members the sbp has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry at the end of 2016 the sbp had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries  including draxs pellet manufacturing arm drax biomass  in mississippi and louisiana its a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides drax with the assurance that it is powering the uk using biomass from legal and sustainable sources like the fastreducing

affordable renewable power but people need electricity instantly  not just when its a windy night or a sunny day so until a time when storage can provide enough affordable capacity to store and supply the grid with power from ample solar and wind farms the country has to rely in part on thermal generation like gas coal and biomass reliable and available on demand yes but renewable low carbon and affordable too it can be a year ago a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers at imperial college london highlighted how a balanced mix of renewable technologies could save bill payers more than 2bn  now publicly available ofgem data on which its newly published renewables obligation annual report 201516 is based reinforces the case for government to continue to support coaltobiomass unit conversions within that technology mix why because out of all renewables deployed at large scale biomass presents the most value for money  less public funding is required for more power produced renewable costs compared drax power stations biomass upgrades were the largest recipient of renewable obligation ro support during the period 201516 the transformation from coal to compressed wood pellets has made drax the largest generator of renewable electricity in the country and by a significant margin drax power station produced more than five times the renewable power than the next biggest project supported under the ro  the london array dr iain staffell lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy imperial college london and author of electric insights  who has analysed the ofgem data commented based on ofgems renewables obligation database the average support that drax power station received was 4305 per mwh generated this compares to 8870 per mwh from the other nine largest projects biomass receives half the support of the uks other large renewable projects which are all offshore wind the average support received across all renewable generators in the ro scheme  which includes much smaller projects and all types of technology  is 58 per mwh that is around 15 per mwh more than the support received by drax ending the age of coal drax group isnt arguing for limitless support for coaltobiomass conversions and drax power station being the biggest most modern and efficient of power stations built in the age of coal  is a special case but if the ro did exist just to support lots of biomass conversions like drax but no other renewable technologies then in just one year between 201516 1bn of costs saving could have been made for the public purse drax power station may be the biggestsingle site recipient of support under the ro  but it does supply more low carbon power into the national grid than any other company supported by renewable obligation certificates rocs in fact 65 of the electricity generated at its selby north yorkshire site is now renewable thats 16 of the entire countrys renewable power  enough to power four million households thanks to the support provided to drax by previous governments the current administration has a comparatively cost effective way to help the power sector move towards a lower carbon future biomass electricity generated at drax power station has a carbon footprint that is at least 80 less than coal power  supply chain included drax group stands ready to

2017 power generation in the spring budget 2017 the chancellor announced that the government remains committed to carbon pricing philip hammonds red book revealed that from 202122 the government will target a total carbon price and set the specific tax rate  giving businesses greater clarity on the total price they will pay further details on carbon prices are to be set out at autumn budget 2017 researchers at imperial college london have modelled what would have happened during 2016 with no carbon tax and also with an increased carbon tax they have compared both with what actually happened their conclusion no carbon tax would mean more coal less gas higher emissions a higher carbon tax would mean less coal more gas lower emissions since it was announced in 2011 the carbon price support cps has encouraged generators and industry to invest in lower carbon and renewable technologies it has also forced coal generators to fire their boilers only when they are really needed to meet demand such as during the winter months or at times of peak demand and still or overcast weather conditions during the summer months the introduction of the carbon price has meant that gas power stations which are less carbon intensive than coal have jumped ahead of coal in the economic merit order of energy generation technologies and produced a greater share of the uks power the same is the case for former coal generation units that have since upgraded to sustainable biomass  three such units at drax power station result in savings in greenhouse gas ghg emissions of at least 80 a coal cliff edge the carbon price support has resulted in significant savings in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions helping the uk meet its international climate change commitments removing or reducing the cps too soon and britains power mix risks going back in time it would improve the economics of coal and encourage britains remaining coal power stations to stay open for longer creating a risk to security of supply through a cliff edge of coal closures in the mid2020s changing the economics to favour coal also makes it harder to reach the uk governments goal of bringing a new fleet of gas power stations online what if  dr iain staffell from the centre for environmental policy at imperial college london has modelled a scenario in which the carbon price support did not exist in 2016 if the government had abolished all carbon pricing we would probably have seen a 20 increase in the power sectors carbon emissions said staffell removing the carbon price support would have the equivalent environmental impact of every single person in the uk deciding to drive a car once a year from lands end to john ogroats without the carbon price support emissions from electricity consumption would be 20 higher meaning an extra 250 kg per person equivalent to driving a car 800 miles running the numbers the carbon price support is capped at 18tco 2 until 2021 in his budget on 8 th march 2017 chancellor philip hammond  rightly in the view of drax  confirmed the governments commitment to carbon pricing using data from national grid and elexon and analysis from dr iain staffell electric insights shows how coal power generation was only needed last winter when electricity demand was greater than could be produced by other technologies alone coal was only used at times of peak demand because it was among the most expensive energy technologies in part due to the cps what if that wasnt the case and the government had decided to scrap the cps before that point in time more coal is burnt particularly during the daytimes  on average coal produces 2500 mw more over this week equivalent to four of drax power stations six generation units and what does dr iain staffells model suggest would have happened if the cap was doubled to 36tco 2  the change is stark even for a week in the winter with an average temperature across the country of 86 o c to see coal generation reduced so much compared to the actual cps of 18tco 2 or the 0tco 2 scenario model illustrates the impact of the carbon price support could bill payers save one argument for reducing the carbon price support  or scrapping it altogether  is the possibility that consumers and nondomestic electricity bill payers would save money its worth noting that apparent savings for electricity bill payers are lowered when the whole way that power is priced is accounted for by the time it reaches homes and businesses carbon price support does increase the cost of wholesale power says staffell but if you add the extra taxes other renewable and low carbon support measures transmission and balancing charges and fees imposed by electricity suppliers the overall impact on consumer bills is modest so if the government abolished all carbon pricing we could expect a 1 pkwh reduction in our tariffs but a 21 increase in our carbon emissions as a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers from imperial college london has already shown there are other ways to save bill payers money while encouraging a low carbon future their analysis published in early 2016 found that households and businesses could save 2bn if the government considered the whole system cost of electricity generation and supply when designing its competitions for support under its contracts for difference cfd scheme 2016 redux without the carbon price support the uk wouldnt have managed to send carbon emissions back to 19 th century levels  so if 2016 was played out one more time but with no carbon price support coal generation would have increased by 102 28 terawatthours to 56 twh gas generation would have decreased by 21 27 twh to 101 twh carbon emissions would have risen by 21 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to 92mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have increased by 20 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 349 gco 2 kwh and if 2016 had seen a doubling of the cps to 36tco 2  coal generation would have decreased by 47 129 twh to 147 twh gas generation would have increased by 9 118 twh to 1395 twh carbon emissions would have decreased by 10 73 mt co 2  to 686 mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have decreased by 9 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 263 gco 2 kwh the two scenarios presented above only modelled the impact of no or a higher carbon price support on nuclear coal and gas power supply in the realworld changes to the carbon price support would also impact on energy technologies that operate under the renewables obligation ro such as two of draxs three biomass units and much of the countrys other renewable capacity cps changes would also likely impact imports and storage while no analysis is perfect this clearly illustrates the significantly negative impact that scrapping or reducing the carbon price support would have on the uks decarbonisation agenda it also highlights the benefits that the governments decision to remain committed to carbon pricing will deliver what if  britain had no carbon

britains power system 9 february 2017 power generation its no secret 2016 was a year of change but beyond the high stakes political changes were events that indicate a shift of a similar size if far less controversial  the move to a decarbonised power network in the last three months of 2016 this change was characterised by four firsts in the history of britains power network each one signals a continuing trend that could offer a sign of whats to come in the future the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report from researchers at imperial college london commissioned by drax it tracks the rises and falls of the power generation system in england scotland and wales plus its environmental impact 1 wind power reached record output but was down overall one of the most interesting events was the way the wind blew  both a lot and not very much 2016 was the first ever year that wind generated more power than coal and a large part of that was thanks to the weather on the 23 rd december storm barbara hit the uk bringing strong winds of up to 90 miles per hour as a result wind output produced more than 10gw for the first time ever beating the previous record of 94gw set in 2014 at its peak wind power met 37 of british demand generating enough electricity for 15 million people  or everyone and everything north of nottingham but despite these peaks over the full quarter wind output was in fact 7 lower than the same time period in 2015 so while it was a quarter that showed how important a part of our power make up wind is right now and will be in the future it also showed how much it depends on the weather 2 britain exported more power to france than it imported for the first time in six years britain exported more electricity to france than it imported electricity flows between the two countries via an undersea interconnector called the interconnexion franceangleterre  and normally we accept more from the french nuclear generators and its other power sources than we send back that changed at the end of 2016 more than a dozen of frances nuclear power stations where turned off after safety checks found a flaw in their design while urgent maintenance took place during the last few months of 2016 british electricity generators exported power to meet french demand  taking advantage of higherthanusual electricity prices on the other side of the english channel in fact britain exported more in one week in november than over the whole of 2014 and 2015 combined 3 carbon emissions were at a 60year low low carbon energy sources keep on rising as a proportion of the uks total output and in the last quarter of 2016 this meant carbon emissions fell to their lowest autumn level for 60 years overall in 2016 coal generation fell by 61 as a mixture of low gas prices and the carbon price floor continued to force it off the system low carbon power sources grew to fill the gap contributing an average of 40 of the uks power while gas generation was up by more than 50 more than that the quarter also saw another record  britains cleanest christmas in history  up to 81 of britains power was generated by low carbon sources and the share of nuclear biomass hydro wind and solar did not fall below 60 during the three days between christmas eve and boxing day 4 electricity prices hit a new peak but also dipped below zero electricity prices reached their highest in a decade 1528 per mwh but they didnt stay there  for nineteen hours during the quarter they also dropped below zero negative energy prices occur when there is low demand and power being generated from inflexible sources for example the current british nuclear fleet plus wind and solar exceeds the amount needed when this happens generators have to pay to offload the excess electricity which means elexon  the body that handles payments in the balancing market  is essentially managing a market thats paying below zero for electricity these extremes raise the question of whether such price volatility is the new normal as more renewable energy comes onto the network its sensitivity to the elements increases which in turn can increase volatility the answer is possibly what does this mean for the future the number of firsts in britains power system signifies the scale of change its currently seeing with the end date for coal coming ever closer the country is increasingly realising the importance of exploring  and using  lowercarbon fuels to generate its electricity given the pace of change weve already seen by the time we reach the last few months of 2017 britain may well be welcoming in another new range of electricity firsts explore the data in detail by visiting wwwelectricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric insights is

electric insights your neighbourhood electricity network 31 january 2017 electrification britains electricity network is a lot like its roads for long distance highspeed journeys the road network has motorways  the electricity networks equivalent is the national grid  which transfers power across the country at extremely high voltages between 400000132000 volts and high speeds for shorter journeys at progressively lower speeds the traffic network has a and b roads these are the regional distribution networks these regional distribution networks take power at 132000 volts and transform it down in stages to 230 volts and make the link from the national grid to local distribution systems that deliver electricity to homes and businesses and while these a and b roads of electricity may be one of the most important parts of getting electricity from power station to plug very few people spare them any thought electricity in the north west when the government first privatised the electricity network in 1989  it set up different distribution regions to provide national coverage through a series of similarlysized regions says pete emery senior director of electricity north west  today each part of the uk is served by one of 14 different regional networks and in the north west across the pennines from where drax power station operates in north yorkshire thats the job of electricity north west it was formed in 1995 and today delivers around 23 terawatts of power to 22 million homes and 200000 business every year it does that using a vast network of more than 13000 km of overhead cables 44000 km of underground cables making it the second most underground electricity network in the uk behind london and more than 34000 transformers which work to convert the electricity from transmission voltage to one that can be used in uk homes  the scale of infrastructure needed to create these regional networks mean that each one is a natural monopoly in this case its a monopoly that benefits customers a natural monopoly a natural monopoly is when the cost of duplicating the assets needed to provide the service outweighs the benefits of efficiency that having competition would provide explains emery so it is in the public interest to have only one provider for decades each regional distribution network has operated the same way delivering power consistently to uk homes but as the country moves into the future of cleaner more sustainable energy  these grids are changing rapidly the potential proliferation of battery technologies and the increasing variation of power sources and their demands on the grid mean changes are in store for distributors like electricity north west one such factor already having an effect is embedded generation across the country there are sources of electricity generation that arent connected to regional distribution networks  for example private solar panels on domestic roofs wind turbines on private land or smallscale power stations connected to a single private distribution network and when there is excess electricity generated from these sources it can be sold back to electricity suppliers in the north west this embedded generation is fed back into emerys network in our region alone we have 2200 mw of embedded generation  more than half the capacity of drax power station  which means we already manage and control the power this input brings to the electricity system says emery they are invisible to national grid this is a radical change and its happening now regardless of whats to come whats certain is therell be traffic on the a roads of electricity tags energy policy  electricity  national grid a positive negative 18 january 2017 carbon capture this story was updated in june 2018 following the announcement of draxs pilot beccs project is there a way to generate electricity not only with no emissions but with negative emissions its an idea that after decades of being reliant on coal had seemed almost impossible but as drax has shown by announcing a pilot of the first bioenergy carbon capture storage beccs project of its kind in europe  it might not be impossible for much longer a few years on from the historic paris agreement  which sets a target of keeping global temperature rise below two degrees celsius  innovative solutions for reducing emissions are critical among these few are more promising than beccs it sounds like a straightforward solution  capture carbon emissions and lock them up hundreds of metres underground or turn the carbon into useful products  but the result could be gamechanging generating electricity with negative emissions capturing carbon carbon capture and storage ccs technology works by trapping the carbon dioxide co 2  emitted after a fuel source has been used and moving it to safe storage  often in depleted oil and gas reservoirs underground there are a number of ccs technologies available but one of the simplest is oxyfuel combustion fuel such as coal gas or biomass is burnt in a high oxygen environment and co 2  rather than carbon c or carbon monoxide co  is produced other impurities are removed and the resulting pure co 2 is compressed to form a liquid this co 2 can then be transported via pipeline to its designated storage space normally hundreds of metres underground the uk is wellplaced to benefit from the technology thanks to the north sea  which has enough space to store the eus carbon emissions for the next 100 years its a technology that can drastically reduce the emissions from fossil fuel use but how can it be used to produce negative emissions two technologies working as one biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured as part of its life in the forest is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report published by the energy technology institute eti looking at the uk has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year  approximately half the nations emissions target its not the only body heralding it as a necessary step for the future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated in a 2014 report that keeping global warming below two degrees celsius would be difficult if beccs had limited deployment support is widespread but for it to lead to a practical future beccs needs suitable support and investment mills such as morehouse bioenergy manufacture compressed wood pellets  a sustainablysourced fuel for beccs power plants of the future positive support for negative emissions there are only a handful of ccs projects in operation or under construction across the world and many simply reuse rather than capture the co 2  part of the reason is cost its estimated that optimal ccs technology can cost about as much as the power station itself to install and running it can consume up to 20 of a stations power output this means more fuel is needed to produce the same amount of power compared to a conventional power plant of similar efficiency without government support it remains a prohibitively expensive solution for many power generators with government support in the form of multidecade contracts large ccs or beccs plants could leverage economies of scale they could deliver energy companies and their shareholders a return on the investments in the longterm drax research and development past plans by drax could have put the company on a timeline towards becoming the worlds first large scale negative emitter of co 2  it would have achieved it firstly with the construction of a ccs power station at its selby north yorkshire site the 428 mw white rose power station was to be fuelled by a mixture of coal and biomass and once in operation could have paved the way for similar facilities elsewhere as carbon capture technology improved and costs came down but unfortunately the project never went ahead  there are some positive signs that carbon capture technologies are developing around the world the first clean coal power station became operational in the us earlier this month  and a second ccs plant is on the way a ukbacked carbon capture and use ccu project in india recently opened at a chemicals factory involving the capture of emissions for use in the manufacturing process  back in the uk where the government outlined plans to end coalfired power generation by 2025  carbon capture power stations must become financially competitive if they are to become a major part of the countrys low carbon future but if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must and beccs remains a leading technology to help achieve it tags power station  negative emissions  beccs bioenergy with
