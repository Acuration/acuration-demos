subject to ts capacity and ministerial sign off following the designation of the viking ccs cluster as a track2 cluster in july 2023 there are now two potential routes which could support the drax power station beccs project and wider ccs in the humber region by 2030  the east coast cluster and viking ccs cluster desnz also set out an indicative timeline that shortlisted projects would commence negotiations from autumn 2024 desnz will now receive feedback on its draft proposals pending further updates and the publication of final guidance in due course will gardiner drax ceo said the governments statements are a helpful step forward not just for beccs in the uk but for the wider fight against climate change we can only reach net zero by investing in critical new green technologies such as beccs i welcome the governments draft position and urge them to progress with both track1 expansion and track2 processes in parallel this winter separately in august 2023 the uk government published a biomass strategy which set out its position on the use of biomass in the uks plans for delivering net zero the biomass strategy outlined the potential  extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon dioxide removals this is in addition to formal bilateral discussions between drax and the government in relation to a potential bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and

end tags drax power station  beccs biomass and beccs are essential in the uks journey to net zero 10 august 2023 opinion the strategy provides an important steer on the short medium and longterm use of biomass in the uks 2050 net zero target with the governments strategy in hand i am more certain than ever on two things first that there remains a clear and powerful role for biomass and beccs in helping the uk balance harder to abate sectors like aviation and reach net zero and secondly that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs has a vital role to play in our global energy transition  and that drax is well placed to deliver why we should be confident in developing the strategy the government has considered several factors including availability of biomass and the priorities for end use impacts on air quality the sustainability of biomass use as well as the role of beccs in helping to reach our longterm climate goals the priority use framework evaluates where biomass would be most sustainably and efficiently used across sectors given supply constraints this framework is an important tool which has been developed with four key principles in mind sustainability air quality the circular economy and resource efficiency and ability to support us getting to net zero critically the priority use framework states that in the shortterm 2020s government will continue to facilitate sustainable biomass deployment through a range of incentives and requirements covering power heat and transport in the mediumterm to 2035 government intends to further develop biomass use for utilities such as heat and power with a view to where possible transition to beccs biomass for use in beccs should be prioritised in the long term to 2050 its very encouraging to see government recognise the important role that biomass plays in our energy transition in both the short and medium term as well as its prioritisation of beccs in the long term although there are various routes for deploying beccs across different industries the strategy further prioritises the deployment of beccs on existing biomass generation plants with established supply chains further supported by the development of the powerbeccs business model for the first beccs projects the strategy is also promising as it presents an evidencedriven basis for longterm policy stability and i believe if the government continues in this direction it will draw investment to the uks bioenergy industry why this is critical for the country biomass has already played an important role in supporting energy security while helping the uk decarbonise displacing fossil fuels with a source of renewable dispatchable power our work has also made a significant contribution to the uk economy adding an estimated 18 billion to the uk gdp and supporting 17800 jobs in 2021 alone and looking to the future beccs presents an enormous opportunity to the uk early investment in this critical technology has the potential to support energy security and climate targets whilst creating jobs and making the uk a leader in the potentially trilliondollar global cdr market this work needs to happen now  nearly all realistic pathways to limit warming to 15c require the carbon removal technology and renewable power beccs offers and expert voices at the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change the uks climate change committee and forum for the future have said that carbon removals will be needed to address the climate crisis todays strategy is a clear signal from government that they recognise the importance of beccs and the urgency with which we must employ it within the uk why this is encouraging for drax drax is an international growing sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security and i believe the strategy we have seen from government today is a clear indication of their support for the work that we do with beccs drax has the ability to become a global leader in carbon removals technology we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in transforming drax power station into the worlds largest carbon removals project the prioritisation of beccs within the priority use framework shows the government is aligned to this vision as we look forward we welcome the governments biomass strategy and will continue to unpack what it means for our business over the coming days and weeks with a mind to our next steps government must now ensure that as it progresses its consultation on biomass sustainability that that process is equally evidencedriven and ensures that sciencebased methods drive the policy forward we hope to continue to work alongside government to support these efforts our formal discussions with the uk government on beccs and a bridging mechanism to support the transition to beccs have been productive but to realise the scale of the ambition included in the governments strategy we need commitment through the delivery of a clear business model that supports beccs todays support from government brings us a big step closer and we look forward to continuing the work will gardiner ceo drax read rns here  tags drax power station  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage

largescale carbon removals will gardiner drax ceo said will gardiner drax group ceo we welcome the uk governments clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that beccs can play in achieving the countrys climate goals the inclusion of beccs at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the uk wants to be a leader in carbon removals and drax is ready to deliver on this ambition we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in delivering beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire simultaneously providing reliable renewable power and carbon removals we look forward to working alongside the government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy through further progression of plans for beccs and ensuring an evidencedriven best practice approach to sustainability a priority role for beccs the strategy reiterates the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 with the potential for this to increase to 23mt by 2035 and up to 81mt by 2050 with beccs expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050 in the period to 2035 government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating whilst supporting projects transitioning to beccs beccs projects which includes drax power station are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and carbon capture and storage ccs technology ready to be deployed beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without beccs in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security the strategy notes the active work in government to support beccs including the development of business models biomass availability and sustainability the strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6 th carbon budget alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors a link to the strategy can be found here  scientific assessment of carbon removals from beccs alongside publication of the strategy the government has published an evidencebased assessment of beccs as a route to negative emissions the report sets out how well regulated beccs can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people the environment and the climate beccs at drax power station in march 2023 the government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of largescale powerbeccs projects by 2030 and that the drax power station beccs project had passed the deliverability assessment for the powerbeccs project submission process formal bilateral discussions with the government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 these discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of beccs at drax power station drax believes that beccs at drax power station is the only project in the uk that can enable the government to achieve this ambition in addition to the largescale renewable power and system support services it provides to the uk power system in july 2023 the government designated the viking ccs cluster as a track 2 cluster progressing a co 2 transport and storage network in the humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of highskilled

development at drax key takeaways the humber industrial cluster contributes 18 billion a year to the uk economy and supports 360000 jobs in heavy industry and manufacturing as demand for industrial products with green credentials rises and net zero targets demand decarbonisation businesses in the humber need to begin implementing carbon capture at scale the size of the humber and diversity of industries make it a significant challenge but if we get it right the humber will be a world leader in decarbonisation without investment in decarbonisation infrastructure the region risks losing its status as a world leading industrial cluster putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk when the iconic humber bridge opened in june 1981 it did more than just set records for its size it connected the region uniting both communities and industries and allowing the humber to become what it is today a thriving industrial hub that contributes more than 18 billion to the uk economy and supports some 360000 jobs as the uk works towards a lowcarbon future the shift to a green economy will require new regional infrastructure that once again unites the humbers people and businesses around a shared goal while the humber bridge connected the region across the estuary waters a new subterranean pipeline that can transport the carbon captured from industries will unify the regions decarbonisation efforts its infrastructure that will be crucial in helping the uk reach its net zero goals but also cement the humbers position as a global decarbonisation leader the humber bridge capturing carbon across the humber capturing carbon  preventing emissions from entering the atmosphere and storing them safely and permanently is a fundamental part of decarbonising the economy and tackling climate change aside from the chemical engineering required to extract carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial emissions one of the key challenges of carbon capture is how you transport it at scale to secure storage locations such as below the north sea bed where the carbon can be permanently trapped and sequestered  click to viewdownload engineers at drax power station at drax were pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology but carbon capture will play an important role in decarbonising a wide range of industries the humber region not only produces about 20 of the uks electricity its also a major hub for chemicals refining steel making and other carbonintensive industries the consequence of this industrial mix is that the humbers carbon footprint per head of population is bigger than anywhere else in the country at an international level its the second largest industrial cluster by co 2 emissions in the whole of western europe if the uk is to reach net zero the humber must decarbonise and carbon capture and storage will be instrumental in achieving that the scale of the challenge in the humber also makes it an opportunity to significantly reduce the countrys overall emissions and break new ground implementing carbon capture innovations across a wide range of industries these diverse businesses can be united in their collective efforts and connected through shared decarbonisation infrastructure  equipment to capture emissions pipelines to transport them and a shared site to store them safely and permanently economies of scale through shared infrastructure the idea of a co 2 transport pipeline traversing the humber might sound unusual but largescale natural gas pipelines have crisscrossed the region since the late 1960s when gas was dispatched from the easington terminal on the east yorkshire coast under the humber to killingholme in north lincolnshire further the uks existing legislation creates an environment to ensure they can be operated safely and effectively co 2 is a very stable molecule compared to natural gas and there are already thousands of miles of co 2 pipelines operating around the us where its historically been used in oil recovery a shared pipeline also offers economies of scale for companies to implement carbon capture allowing the humbers cluster of carbonintensive industries to invest in vital infrastructure in a costeffective way the diversity of different industries in the region from renewable baseload power generation at drax to cuttingedge hydrogen production  also offers a chance to experiment and showcase whats possible at scale the humbers position as an estuary onto the north sea is also advantageous its expansive layers of porous sandstone offer an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space the humber estuary but this isnt just an opportunity to decarbonise the uks most emissionsintensive region its a stage to present a new green industrial hub to the world a hub that could create as many as 47800 jobs including high quality technical and construction roles as well as other jobs throughout supply chains and the wider uk economy british innovation as a global export as industries of all kinds across the world race to decarbonise theres an increasing demand for products with green credentials if we can decarbonise products from the region such as steel  it will give uk businesses a global edge failure to follow through on environmental ambitions however will not just damage the clusters status it will put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk breaking new ground is difficult but there are firstmover advantages the products and processes trialled and run at scale within the humber offer intellectual property that industrial hubs around the world are searching for creating a new export for the uk but this vision of a decarbonised humber that exports both its products and knowledge to the world is only possible if we take the right action now we have a genuine global leadership position if we dont act now that will be lost through projects like zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster  alongside net zero teesside the regions businesses have shown our collective commitment to implementing decarbonisation at scale through collaboration as a track 1 cluster  the humber presents one of the uks greatest opportunities to level up  attracting global businesses and investors as well as protecting and creating skilled jobs we need to seize this moment and put in place the infrastructure

the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in

gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2021 opinion leaders from 40 countries are meeting today albeit virtually as part of president joe bidens leaders summit on climate  the event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change set a clear pathway to net zero emissions while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition since taking office president biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the united states back into the paris agreement ahead of the twoday summit he announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target and new nationally determined contributions the us joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per year sending it for secure storage permanently locking it away deep under the north sea experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy it would also act as an anchor project for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to create the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the humber region and more than 200000 around the uk in 2039 additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south and western canada a global company as a britishnorth american company drax embodies the positive impact that clean energy investments have we directly employ 3400 people in the us canada and the uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on

working forests of the us south and western canada to the yorkshire and humber region and scotland we have a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 at drax we believe the challenge of climate change is an opportunity to improve the environment we live in we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 and transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the rest of the world  a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green economic recovery if we are to reach the targets set in paris global leaders must lock in this
