power station could hydrogen power stations offer flexible electricity for a net zero future the most abundant element in the universe offers a superior source of gas 26 august 2020 power generation were familiar with using natural gas every day in heating homes powering boilers and igniting stove tops but this same natural gas  predominantly methane  is also one of the most important sources of electricity to the uk in 2019 gas generation accounted for 39 of great britains electricity mix  but that could soon be changing hydrogen the super simple super light element can be a zerocarbon emissions source of fuel while were used to seeing it in everyday in water h 2 o as a gas it has been tested as an alternative to methane in homes and as a fuel for vehicles  could it also replace natural gas in power stations and help keep the lights on the need for a new gas hydrogen fuel station natural gas has been the largest single source of electricity in great britain since around 2000 aside from the period 2012 14 when coal made a resurgence due to high gas prices the dominance of gas over coal is in part thanks to the abundant supply of it in the north sea along with carbon pricing  domestic supply makes gas much cheaper than coal and much cleaner emitting as much as 60 less co 2 than the solid fossil fuel added to this is the ability of gas power stations to start up change their output and shut down very quickly to meet sudden shifts in electricity demand this flexibility is helpful to support the growth of weatherdependant renewable sources of power such as wind or solar the stability gas brings has helped the country decarbonise its power supply rapidly hydrogen on the other hand can be an even cleaner fuel as it only releases water vapour and nitrous oxide when combusted in large gas turbines this means it could offer a low or zerocarbon flexible alternative to natural gas that makes use of great britains existing gas infrastructure but its not as simple as just switching fuels switching gases some thermal power stations work by combusting a fuel such as biomass or coal in a boiler to generate intense heat that turns water into highpressure steam which then spins a turbine gas turbines however are different engineer works on a turbine at drax power station instead of heating water into steam a simple gas turbine blasts a mix of gas plus air from the surrounding atmosphere at high pressure into a combustion chamber where a chemical reaction takes place  oxygen from the air continuously feeding a gaspowered flame the highpressure and hot gasses then spin a turbine the reaction that takes place inside the combustion chamber is dependent on the chemical mix that enters it natural gas turbines have been tailored and optimised for their working conditions explains richard armstrong drax lead engineer hydrogen is a gas that burns in the same way as natural gas but it burns at different temperatures at different speeds and it requires different ratios of oxygen to get the most efficient combustion switching a power station from natural gas to hydrogen would take significant testing and refining to optimise every aspect of the process and ensure everything is safe this would no doubt continue over years subtly developing the engines over time to improve efficiency in a similar way to how natural gas combustion has evolved but its certainly possible what may be trickier though is providing the supply of hydrogen necessary to power and balance the countrys electricity system  making hydrogen hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but its very rare to find it on its own because its so atomically simple its highly reactive and almost always found naturally bonded to other elements water is the prime example its made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom making it h 2 o hydrogens tendency to bond with everything means a pure stream of it as would be needed in a power station has to be produced rather than extracted from underground like natural gas hydrogen as a gas at standard temperature and pressure is known by the symbol h 2  a power station would also need a lot more hydrogen than natural gas by volume it would take three times as much hydrogen to produce the same amount of energy as would be needed with natural gas however because it is so light the hydrogen would still have a lower mass a very large supply of hydrogen would be needed which doesnt exist in the uk at the moment says rachel grima research  innovation engineer at drax so at the same time as converting a power plant to hydrogen youd need to build a facility to produce it alongside it one of the most established ways to produce hydrogen is through a process known as steam methane reforming this applies high temperatures and pressure to natural gas to break down the methane which makes up the majority of natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide co 2  the obvious problem with the process is it still emits co 2  meaning carbon capture and storage ccs systems are needed if it is to be carbon neutral source zero carbon humber its almost like capturing the co 2 from natural gas before its combusted rather than postcombustion explains grima one of the advantages of this is that the co 2 is at a much higher concentration which makes it much easier to capture than in flue gas when it is diluted with a lot of nitrogen using natural gas in the process produces whats known as grey hydrogen adding carbon capture to make the process carbon neutral is known as blue hydrogen  but there are ways to make it with renewable energy sources too electrolysis is already an established technology where an electrical current is used to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen this green hydrogen cuts out the co 2 emissions that come from using natural gas however like charging an electric vehicle the process is only carbonneutral if the electricity powering it comes from zero carbon sources such as nuclear wind and solar its also possible to produce hydrogen from biomass by putting biomass under high temperatures and adding a limited amount of oxygen to prevent the biomass combusting the biomass can be gasified meaning it is turned into a mix of hydrogen and co 2  by using a sustainable biomass supply chain where forests absorb the equivalent of the co 2 emitted but where some fossil fuels are used within the supply chain the process becomes low carbon carbon capture use and storage ccus incubation area drax power station ccs can then be added to make it carbon negative overall meaning more co 2 is captured and stored at forest level and in belowground carbon storage than is emitted throughout its lifecycle this form of green hydrogen is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen or negative emissions hydrogen there are plenty of options for making hydrogen but doing it at the scale needed for power generation and ensuring its an affordable fuel is the real challenge then there is the issue of transporting and working with hydrogen the difficulty is less in converting the uks gas power stations and turbines themselves thats a hurdle but most turbine manufacturers already in the process of developing solutions for this says armstrong the challenge is establishing a stable and consistent supply of hydrogen and the transmission network to get it to site working with the lightest known element today hydrogen is mainly transported by truck as either a gas or cooled down to minus253 degrees celsius at which point it becomes a liquid lh 2  however there is plenty of infrastructure already in place around the uk that could make transporting hydrogen significantly more efficient the uk has a very advanced and comprehensive gas grid a conversion to hydrogen would be more economic if you could repurpose the existing gas infrastructure says hannah steedman innovation engineer at drax the most feasible way to feed a power station is through pipelines and a lot of work is underway to determine if the current natural gas network could be used for hydrogen hydrogen is different to natural gas in that it is a very small and highly reactive molecule therefore it needs to be treated differently for example parts of the existing gas network are made of steel a metal which hydrogen reacts with causing whats known as hydrogen embrittlement which can lead to cracks and failures that could potentially allow gas to escape there are also factors around safety and efficiency to consider like natural gas hydrogen is also odourless meaning it would need to have an odourant added to it experimentation is underway to find out if mercaptan the odourant added to natural gas to give it a sulphuric smell is also compatible with hydrogen but for all the challenges that might come with switching to hydrogen there are huge advantages the uks gas network  both power generation and domestic  must move away from fossil fuels if it is to stop emitting co 2 into the atmosphere and for the country to reach net zero by 2050 while the process will not be as simple as switching gases it creates an opportunity to upgrade the uks gas infrastructure  for power in homes and even as a vehicle fuel  source zero carbon humber it wont happen overnight but hydrogen is a proven energy fuel source while it may take time to ramp up production to a scale which can meet demand at a reasonable cost transitioning to hydrogen is a chance to futureproof the gas systems that contributes so heavily to the uks stable power system  share
