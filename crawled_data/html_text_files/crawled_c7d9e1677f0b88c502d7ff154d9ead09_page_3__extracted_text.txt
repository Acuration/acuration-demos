biomass energy supporting the deployment of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs in the uk business model options 8 april 2021 carbon capture click to viewdownload the report pdf drax power station is currently exploring the option of adding carbon capture and storage equipment to its biomassfired generating units the resulting plant could produce at least 8 million tonnes mt of negative co 2 emissions each year as well as generating renewable electricity drax is planning to make a final investment decision fid on its bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs in power 1  investment in q1 2024 with the first beccs unit to be operating by 2027 the potential of beccs as part of the path to net zero has been widely recognised beccs in power is an important part of all of the climate change committee cccs net zero scenarios contributing to negative emissions of between 16 39mt co 2 e per year by 2050 2  investment needs to occur early by 2035 the ccc sees a role for 34gw of beccs as part of a mix of low carbon generation 3  the governments energy white paper commits by 2022 to establishing the role which beccs can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed the government has also committed to invest up to 1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture usage and storage ccus in four industrial clusters 4  national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes indicate that it is not possible to achieve net zero without beccs 5  however at present a business model 6 which could enable this investment is not in place a business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible there is no market for negative emissions there is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them positive spillovers are not remunerated  positive spillovers that would be delivered by a firstofakind beccs power plant but which are not remunerated include providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage ts infrastructure that can be used by subsequent ccs projects delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent beccs power plants and delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of ccs projects including hydrogen production with ccs beccs relies on the presence of co 2 transport and storage infrastructure  where this infrastructure doesnt already exist or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain this presents a significant risk to investors in beccs in power ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload frontier economics has been commissioned by drax to develop and evaluate business model options for beccs in power that could overcome these barriers and help deliver timely investment in beccs business model options we started with a long list of business model options after eliminating options that are unsuitable for beccs in power we considered the following three options in detail power contract for difference cfd the strike price of the cfd would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits carbon payment a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions the payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two options above the carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power cfd would support power market revenues for the plants renewable power output we first considered if committing to any of these business model options for beccs in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader ggr support scheme we assessed whether these options could over time be transitioned into a broader ggr support scheme ie one not just focused on beccs in power and concluded that this would be possible for all of them we then considered how these business model options could be funded and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds for example power cfds are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the low carbon contracts company lccc we concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options so the two decisions can be made independently this means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel we then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the beis consultation on business models for ccs summarised in the figure below figure 1 principles for design of business models instil investor confidence  attract innovation  attract new entrants  instil supply chain confidence cost efficiency  drive efficient management of investment costs  drive efficient quantity of investment  drive efficient dispatch and operation  risks allocated in an efficient way taking into account the impact on the cost of capital feasibility  limit administrative burden  practicality for investors  requirement for complementary policy  wider policy and state aid compatibility  timely implementation fair cost sharing  allows fair and practical cost distribution ease of policy transition  ease of transition to subsidy free system  ease of transition to technology neutral solution source frontier economics click to viewdownload graphic all three business model options performed well across most criteria however our evaluation highlighted some key tradeoffs to consider when choosing a business model investor confidence the power cfd and the twopart model with a cfd performed better than the carbon payment on this measure as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations feasibility the power cfd performed best on this measure because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood it will be quick to implement introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation however this will be needed in any case to support other ccus technologies 7  and could be introduced in time before projects come online and potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free all three options could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral however the standalone power cfd performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions overall the twopart model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world delivering learnings that will be relevant for other ggrs as well conclusions the uks net zero target will be challenging to achieve and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hardtoabate sectors as highlighted by the ccc 8  beccs in power is a particularly important part of this picture and represents a costeffective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed early investment in beccs is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of back ending significant abatement effort however market failures most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings and reliance on availability of ts infrastructure mean that without policy intervention the required level of beccs in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to net zero there are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers in our view a twopart model combining a power cfd and a carbon payment is preferable this measure addresses identified market failures can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early beccs in power investment and can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers including with reference to investors likely cost of capital and in a way that allocates risks appropriately viewdownload the full report pdf  1 biomass can be combusted to generate energy typically in the form of power but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel or gasified to produce hydrogen the resulting emissions can then be captured and stored using ccs technology the focus of this report is on biomass combustion to generate power with ccs which we refer to as beccs in power we refer to biomass gasification with ccs as beccs for hydrogen 2 ccc 2020  the sixth carbon budget greenhouse gas removals

keynote address below or scroll down the page to read his speech in full the energy transition is central to our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future drax has been at the heart of britains energy system for decades and we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector drax power station in selby north yorkshire is the uks largest power station and europes largest decarbonisation project cruachan our scottish pumped storage facility is a key complement to britains ever increasing supply of offshore wind our transition from coal to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the uk this month saw the end of commercial coal generation at drax power station  a milestone in the history of our company and of the uk economy too but the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here which is why we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon water outlet into loch awe from cruachan power station today we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with one ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster  the benefits are enormous beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change expert bodies such as the climate change committee here in the uk and the ipcc at a global level are clear that we need negative emissions technologies including beccs to reach net zero and beccs is central to the uk and europes decarbonisation plans as the worlds largest and most experienced generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to pioneer beccs than at drax the economic social and environmental benefits are enormous beccs at drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help heavy industry in the uks largest emitting area decarbonise quickly and cost effectively it will enable the creation of tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england levelling up the economy and delivering a green recovery from the covid crisis and it will put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to develop carbon removal technology in this the year that we host cop26 in glasgow the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here a proven technology we know that beccs works and that the technology is available now looking at cost projections from the ccc we also know that it is the best value negative emissions technology engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station we have already successfully run two beccs pilots at the power station in 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock and in 2020 we began a second pilot working with mitsubishi heavy industries to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions we aim to deploy beccs at scale by 2027 to that end earlier this month we kickstarted the planning process for our proposals to build our first beccs units  marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 the support we need drax power station has a proud history of transformation and today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future the core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close partnership with government  and it is this partnership that will make beccs a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it an effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as drax we believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months with cop26 later this year making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the uk beccs in context but we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen beccs will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero click to read thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago a partnership with our stakeholders the purpose of todays session is to discuss all these issues and more our aim is clear to enable a successful energy transition at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england but i want your help in making beccs as sustainable and successful as it can be we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests

ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  engineer in the workshop at drax power station we will achieve this by increasing our capacity to generate renewable electricity and by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere  we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with the same ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster i am delighted to confirm today that the zero carbon humber cluster project has received more than 21m in funding from the governments industrial strategy challenge fund to help accelerate our plans and to help transform our vision of a zero

in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 a partnership between industry and government successful decarbonisation has always been a partnership between industry and government  this is evident looking at the incredible rise of britains offshore wind sector as a direct response to governments political commitment a strong price signal and an investable contract for difference mechanism offshore wind capacity has grown from 1gw to over 10gw in a decade and build costs are now two thirds lower than what they were 10 years ago pylon that takes excess wind power to be stored at cruachan pumped hydro storage power station in scotland at drax our conversion from coal to biomass was benefited from much the same framework the uk government was  and continues to be  very strong in its support for biomass as a renewable technology to replace coal our cfd mechanism has given investors the certainty they need to invest and successive governments commitment to a carbon price that matches or exceeds that of our european neighbours has told the market that britain is serious about decarbonising the power sector rapidly that combination of factors  a clear transparent investable framework for renewables combined with a strong price signal from the uk government discouraging fossil fuel power generation  has been the key to driving private sector investment in renewable power technology in the uk as a result the uk leads the world in decarbonising its electricity sector  while also enabling a global technology revolution in offshore wind power importantly the whole effort has been underpinned by transparency competition and confidence in the regulatory and legal framework all of which are critical building a partnership for the future by continuing this partnership between industry and government the uk could become the world leader in emerging green technologies such as beccs right now markets and regulatory frameworks for beccs or negative emissions more broadly either dont exist  or arent flexible enough  to support the scaling of the technologies we need to get to net zero  but the firstgeneration framework as i have just described provides a great model fundamentally we believe that we can do beccs at a cost of less than 100t of co 2  which is less than any other negative emissions technology available we know this investment will help the uk reach net zero at a lower cost than it otherwise could do maintenance inside a water cooling tower at drax power station but although were ready to make the investment  the uks regulatory system isnt yet ready to support it despite being world leaders in these areas our carbon pricing system and financial markets dont yet recognise the value of negative emissions even though our political institutions and scientists say they are vital to tackling climate change  there is no government defined business model for beccs which will be essential to signalling long term political support as well as operational support and despite being the best placed country in the world to develop beccs we risk losing out as other countries race to deploy this technology first just last week we saw aker microsoft and orsted sign a memorandum of understanding to develop beccs in denmark however in its tenpoint plan  the uk government has committed to outline what role biomass and beccs will play in the uks transition to net zero by the end of this year soon it will be consulting on a new bioenergy strategy and it has already taken evidence on greenhouse gas removal technologies and consulted on ccs clusters this we believe demonstrates that a set of policies could emerge in the coming months that will support investment in beccs at their core we think these policies should capture the stability and investability of a cfd for the renewable power that we will produce as well as deliver payment for the negative emissions by compensating negative emissions with a credit for every ton of co 2 they remove from the environment the government can properly reward those technologies and add a critical new set of tools to the fight against climate change  ultimately lower the cost of winning that battle this would enable drax to invest in beccs begin delivering negative emissions and helping to decarbonise the north of england as soon as 2027 with cop26 later this year making this policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future develop here in the uk beccs in context we know

which is a point on the tree stem 137m above the base of the tree or the root collar the exact height can vary by country the height of a standing tree is conventionally measured using a clinometer or hypsometer which measures the angle from the top of the tree to a measured distance away from the base this forms a triangle from which the tree height can be calculated dbh measurement using girth tape tree height measurement using clinometer example of girth and height measurement in the us south the combination of height and girth are then used to estimate total tree volume based on historical models for that particular species in that country or region many decades worth of data measurements and modelling have been used to develop complex equations to estimate volume for each species and circumstance this calculation process needs to estimate the rate of taper of the stem or the difference in diameter between the base and the top of the tree this can be consistent within a single species but it can depend on growth rates and planting density for example closely stocked trees may grow taller and thinner but more openly planted trees tend to be shorter and wider whether the site has been thinned  how many times and at what age can impact the degree of taper in the stem through many years of research measuring and modelling the southern research station srs fia team has developed the following formula for underbark volume calculation this is then modified according to the parameters shown below depending on species and stem characteristics example of volume once the volume has been calculated the basic density solid wood per cubic metre and moisture content can be used to calculate wet and dry weight fibre content and yield a comprehensive record of data the us forest service has built up an extensive historical record of data points through years of physical measurements  from both sampling and cutting down individual sample trees to determine the actual dimensions and statistics to compare against the estimated values over time forest scientists are able to build up reasonably accurate tables for each tree species that can be used to estimate growth and volume based on the dbh and estimated tree height in the uk we have a foresters handbook known as the blue book which contains a vast quantity of modelled data to help a forester calculate volume and growth in a range of different forest types across the country this data has been collected and modelled by the forestry commissions forest research branch  in the us they have a similar system of data collection and modelling but on a bigger scale given the much larger forest area and greater variety in tree species and site type how can you measure an entire forest the forestland area of the us south covers more than 100 million hectares ha in total which can present quite a challenge to measure survey and accurately predict forest growth and health the fia does this through a network of sample plots randomly but sequentially distributed across the forestland in each state with undisclosed locations so as to avoid biased management field crews collect data on forest type site attributes tree species tree size and overall tree condition on accessible forest land recently the programme has involved a fiveyear rolling measurement system where 20 of the plots are measured in each state on an annual basis at the end of a fiveyear period all plots will have been measured and the process begins again this process is overseen by a robust quality assurance system to maintain and ensure the quality and accuracy of the fieldwork plots are distributed at a rate of 1 plot per 6000 acres of land or one per 2400 ha this degree of plot distribution is at an extremely course scale if attempting to understand the growth of an individual stand or forest area for example the blue book recommends using 812 plots and top height measurements for a relatively uniform stand of around 10 ha this degree of accuracy would be required to calculate the volume of standing wood for sale in comparison the fia data would be completely inaccurate if trying to monitor growth and trends at an individual forest level or even at county level this sampling intensity and the scale of measurement are the most critical factors in assessing the validity of data and trends that are identified through the fia and through the caa analysis quantifying the level of accuracy the physical measurement procedure and volume modelling are well established processes with data and analysis collected over many decades to support the findings this leads to a clearly quantifiable degree of error for each measured plot the challenge comes when using plot data to estimate the values in the surrounding forest at this scale the level of accuracy will depend on the ratio of plots to total forest area and the total number of plots measured the ratio of plots per ha in the us south is predetermined limited by the physical and financial constraints of actually measuring trees on the ground however the total number of plots used to evaluate trends can vary according to how large an area is assessed fundamentally if a single county is assessed then the total number of sample plots will be low and the potential for error will be high if an entire state is assessed then the number of plots is much larger despite the same ratio of plots per ha therefore the data and the trend is statistically much more accurate draxs caa analysis falls somewhere in between these two points with each catchment area including multiple counties but not quite at the same scale as state level analysis an example of the variation in error is shown in the table below degree of error for key metrics in draxs caa analysis the data showing total inventory volume of wood growing in the forest has been assessed for the chesapeake catchment area in north carolina and virginia when looking at each individual county the data error calculation is  465 therefore not very accurate if looking at state level the data error is only  27 this degree of error is much more accurate and demonstrates more credible and reliable data due to the much larger number of plots available across the entire state the drax caa analysis for inventory in the chesapeake area is  47 which is reasonably close to the state level accuracy due to the large number of countries that are included in the caa analysis since the catchment area boundary is defined by the pellet mills historical and future sourcing pattern this can vary in size according to each mills procurement strategy and local market conditions for example the amite bioenergy pellet plant sources from a much smaller area close to the mill and therefore the catchment area includes fewer counties this can lead to a higher degree of error than in the other caa reports as the total number of plots used is smaller a long history of measurement and analysis despite this the overall degree of error is still in single figures and can be considered reasonable in each caa report by the standards of forest measurement and modelling an error of under 10 is generally considered acceptable measuring standing trees that are still growing is not an exact science  it is an estimation trees cannot be accurately weighed or measured until they are cut down therefore there will always be degree of error in estimated data in the us south the long history of measurement analysis and data modelling and the relatively homogenous nature of the main commercial species southern yellow pine mean that the error is relatively uniform and predictable if a large sample area is considered the potential for remote sensing data collection and analysis to replace traditional field measurement is an interesting and developing field at an individual forest or stand level it is possible to carry out intensive measurement with laser or lidar to calculate volume and growth however there is currently no reliable accurate and costeffective way to do this at a largescale across several million hectares this may be a possibility as the technology and data interpretation tools continue to develop and drax is working closely with remote sensing specialists to trial and develop this process until then we can rely on boots on the ground and traditional fieldwork for an accurate view of the forest trends across our supply chain this blog supports a series of catchment area analyses around the forest biomass pellet plants supplying drax power station

positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business progressing our strategy to increase our selfsupply reduce our biomass production cost and create a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload we expect to benefit greatly from pinnacles operational and commercial expertise and i am looking forward to what we can achieve together it will pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and become a carbon negative company by 2030  permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year negative emissions from beccs are vital if we are to address the global climate emergency whilst also providing renewable electricity needed in a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery duncan davies chief executive officer of pinnacle said pinnacles board of directors has unanimously determined that the transaction represents the best course of action for the company and its shareholders on closing the transaction will deliver immediate significant and certain cash value to our shareholders at the same time the combination of pinnacle and drax will create a global leader in sustainable biomass with the vision technical expertise and financial strength to help meet the growing demand for renewable energy products which is exciting for our employees customers and others around the world draxs sustainable biomass strategy sustainable biomass has an important role to play in global energy markets as a flexible and sustainable source of renewable energy as well as having the potential to deliver negative emissions drax believes that the acquisition accelerates the groups strategic objectives to increase its available selfsupply of sustainable biomass to five million tonnes per annum drax currently operates 16 million tonnes of capacity with 04 million tonnes in development and reduce the cost of biomass to 50mwh 4 by 2027 through the delivery of these strategic objectives drax aims to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass including thirdparty supply beccs and merchant biomass generation employee at morehouse bioenergy in louisiana the groups enlarged supply chain will have access to 49 million tonnes of operational capacity from 2022 of this total 29 million tonnes are available for draxs selfsupply requirements in 2022 increasing to 34 million tonnes in 2027 drax aims to increase the level of thirdparty sales and further expand its capacity to meet its target of five million tonnes of selfsupply by 2027 drax believes that the acquisition is highly complementary to the groups other longterm strategic options for biomass once optimised the enlarged groups biomass supply chain will support draxs own generation requirements including the potential development of beccs whilst also serving the growing biomass markets in europe and asia via longterm offtake agreements a major producer and supplier of goodquality lowcost sustainable biomass pinnacle which is listed on the toronto stock exchange operates 25 million tonnes of biomass capacity at sites in western canada and the southeastern us with a further 04 million tonnes of capacity in development commissioning in 2021 investment in this new capacity is expected to be substantially complete in the first half of 2021 once the new capacity is commissioned pinnacles nameplate production capacity is expected to increase to 29 million tonnes per annum pinnacle has ownership of c80 of this nameplate capacity with the remaining c20 coowned with its forestry industry joint venture partners ensuring strong commercial relationships and shared interests in security of supply pinnacle has sales and marketing rights to 100 of the output from all sites pinnacle is a key supplier of wood pellets for drax and other third parties in asia and europe with c67 billion of contracted thirdparty sales including sales to drax wood pellets loaded onto vessel at westview terminal british columbia through scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing pinnacle is currently produces biomass at a lower cost than drax with a likeforlike 2019 production cost of us124tonne 3  compared to draxs 2019 production cost of us161tonne 3  the pro forma 2019 production cost for the combined business is us141tonne pinnacles lower cost partially reflects the use of high levels of lowcost sawmill residues british columbia has a large and wellestablished commercial forestry industry which has in recent years seen increased harvest levels in part associated with management of a pine beetle infestation producing good levels of residue material availability for the production of biomass this infestation has now run its course and alongside other influences on the forest landscape including wildfire is resulting in a reduction in the annual harvest and sawmill closures the industry is adjusting to this with some production curtailment as well as developing approaches to fibre recovery and use which is expected to result in some increase in fibre costs since 2017 the sustainable biomass program has conducted annual audits of each of pinnacles operational sites allowing drax to ensure through its diligence that the material that it purchases from pinnacle is in line with its sustainability standards drax is committed to ensuring best practice in health and safety operational efficiency and sustainability across the enlarged group and intends to invest accordingly to deliver this outcome drax is committed to ensuring that its biomass sources are compliant with draxs wellestablished responsible sourcing policy and drax expects to invest in adapt and develop sourcing practices to ensure compliance with draxs policies to deliver both draxs biomass strategy and positive forest outcomes a large and geographically diversified asset base pinnacle has ownership interests in ten operational plants and one in development commissioning 2021 six of which are operated through joint venture arrangements providing access to nameplate production capacity of 29 million tonnes per annum seven of pinnacles sites are in british columbia 16 million tonne nameplate capacity and two are in alberta 06 million tonne nameplate capacity all of these sites have rail lines to ports at either prince rupert or vancouver both accessing the pacific ocean providing routes to asian and european markets pinnacle also operates a us hub at aliceville alabama 03 million tonne nameplate capacity and is developing a second site in demopolis alabama 04 million tonne nameplate capacity which pinnacle expects to commission in 2021 pinnacles total operational and development nameplate capacity in the us is 07 million tonnes pinnacles us sites are close to draxs existing operations in the southeastern us and will utilise river barges to access the port of mobile and bargetoship loading reducing fixed port storage costs working forest in lasalle bioenergy catchment area louisiana all production sites are located in areas with access to fibre and are able to operate with a range of biomass material from existing commercial forestry activities including sawmill residues precommercial thinnings and lowgrade wood combined with a geographic spread of production capacity and access to three separate export facilities pinnacle benefits from operational and sourcing flexibility further enhancing draxs security of supply further information is set out in appendix 1 to this announcement longterm biomass revenues with access to asian and european markets pinnacle has contracted sales of c67 billion with highquality asian and european counterparties including drax this equates to 99 of its current production capacity contracted to third parties through 2026 and a significant volume contracted in 2027 and beyond providing longterm highquality revenues vessel carrying biomass pellets at westview terminal british columbia pinnacle has been supplying biomass to europe since 2004 the location of the majority of pinnacles production capacity in western canada with access to the pacific ocean provides a strong position from which to serve the growing demand for biomass in asian markets in 2018 and 2019 pinnacle entered into 12 new longterm contracts in japan and south korea totalling over 13 million tonnes per annum valued at c46 billion with most contracts commencing between 2021 and 2023 the average contract duration is nine years with certain contracts extending significantly beyond this point contracts typically operate on a takeorpay basis global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the global biomass wood pellet market has a broad range of providers that are expected to expand their production capacity including operators such as enviva graanul invest pinnacle an viet phat fram and sy energy the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by asian demand 5  drax believes that increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and an improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand train pulling biomass wagons storage domes and wood pellet conveyor system drax power station north yorkshire as a vertically integrated producer and consumer of sustainable biomass drax is differentiated from its peers and well positioned to deliver supply chain efficiencies and an expanded range of sustainable biomass materials for ownuse and thirdparty sales through its expanding lower cost supply chain expertise in biomass generation and enhanced global footprint drax believes that there will be opportunities to work with other companies and countries in developing their own biomassenabled decarbonisation strategies strong return on investment the acquisition is expected to be cash generative and represent an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders with expected returns significantly in excess of the groups weighted average cost of capital the addition of longterm contracts with highquality counterparties in growing international biomass markets will reduce the groups relative exposure to commodity prices in line with the groups objective to improve earnings quality and visibility in total the acquisition increases access to lower cost biomass by a further 29 million tonnes after the commissioning of the demopolis plant in 2021 the price paid for this capacity is consistent with the previously outlined strategy to invest in the region of c600 million to deliver draxs plans for five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity and a biomass cost of 50mwh by 2027 for the year ended 27 december 2019 pinnacle generated adjusted ebitda 6 of c47 million from pellet sales of 17 million tonnes pinnacles 2019 performance was impacted by fire at its entwistle plant reduced rail access due to rail industrial action and weather disrupted forestry activity at the same time pinnacle experienced regional canadian sawmill closures resulting in some reduction in sawmill residues and an increase in provincial fibre prices fibre diversification and the development of a second hub in the southeastern us is expected to partially mitigate the risk of fibre price rises taking these factors into account alongside the commissioning of new capacity and the commencement of asian supply contracts pinnacles 2022 consensus ebitda is c99 million increasing to c126 million in 2023 bloomberg the acquisition strengthens the groups ability to pay a sustainable and growing dividend drax does not expect the acquisition to have any impact on its expectations for the final dividend payment for 2020 financing the acquisition the acquisition is expected to be funded from cash and existing agreements on 15 december 2020 the group issued a trading update which noted cash and total committed liquidity of 643 million at 30 november 2020 following the completion on 31 january 2021 of the sale of four gas power stations previously announced on 15 december 2020 the group received cash of 188 million being the agreed purchase price consideration of 164 million and 24 million of customary working capital adjustments net debt to adjusted ebitda 7 in 2021 is expected to be above draxs longterm target of around 2 times immediately after completion of the acquisition but is expected to return to around this level by the end of 2022 management of foreign exchange exposure the acquisition price will be paid in canadian dollars pinnacles existing contracts with drax and third parties are denominated in canadian and us dollars and drax expects to manage any exposure within its foreign exchange processes draxs policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposure on contracted biomass volumes over a rolling fiveyear period this has given rise to an average foreign exchange rate hedge around 140 usgbp sustainable sourcing sustainably sourced biomass is an important part of uk and european renewable energy policy the renewable status of sustainably sourced biomass is based on wellestablished scientific principles set out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and reflected in the european unions eu second renewable energy directive and the uk renewables obligation drax maintains a rigorous approach to biomass sustainability ensuring the wood fibre it uses is fully compliant with the uks mandatory standards as well as those of the eu dead pine trees in background infected with mountain pine beetle british columbia drax recognises that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to commercially managed forests in the southeastern us working in partnership with engo earthworm drax has a good understanding of the considerations associated with sourcing residues from harvesting of primary forest and the particular characteristics of the forests in british columbia and alberta in line with its responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with engo partners indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas operational efficiencies improvements and savings the strong financial returns associated with the acquisition are not dependent on synergy benefits but the group has identified areas for potential operational improvements and efficiencies and opportunities to invest across the supply chain to achieve consistent standards and improve outputs across the enlarged group portfolio optimisation drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio drax believes that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers with existing plans to widen of the groups
