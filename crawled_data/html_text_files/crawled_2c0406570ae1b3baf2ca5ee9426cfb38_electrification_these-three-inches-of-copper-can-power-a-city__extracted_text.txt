power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station these three inches of copper can power a city getting electricity from power stations to plug needs a network of cable and wires that was once britains biggest construction project 17 january 2017 electrification a series of unassuming cables extend out of the turbine hall at drax power station  theyre easily missed but these few inches of copper play an instrumental role in powering your home surging through each one is enough electricity to power a city but the process of getting electricity from power station to plug isnt as simple as connecting one wire to a live turbine and another to your iphone charger we need an entire network of power stations cables and transformers linking the network when the country first became electrified it did so in stages each region of the uk was powered by its own selfcontained power supply that changed in 1926 when the uk set up the central electricity board and began what was at the time the biggest construction project britain had ever seen the national grid the project took 100000 men and five years to complete and when it was finished it connected 122 of the countrys most efficient power stations via 4000 miles of overhead cabling it had a sizeable effect in 1920 there were roughly 750000 electricity consumers by 1938 that had risen to 9 million the grid has changed in the 80 years thats passed but it remains the network that transfers power across the country to where its needed whenever its needed the strange thing about electricity is that you could live 10 miles from a power station and you cant be sure the electricity youre using is coming from that station says callan masters an engineer with national grid whose job it is to maintain and upgrade the network the whole system works together  the whole system has a demand and the whole system has to deliver it and to do this the network has to be able to deliver electricity quickly and efficiently masters explains it acts like a motorway for power riding the motorway for power the process of transporting electricity involves a series of stages the first of which is stepping up the voltage when electricity is transported via cables or wires it loses some of its energy as heat think of a lightbulb  as it illuminates it heats up because its losing energy the lower the current of that electricity however the less energy is lost so to reduce these losses when transporting power national grid transmits electricity at low currents which it can do by increasing its voltage at the power station electricity is generated at 23500 volts and is then stepped up to 400000 volts by a transformer the first of these is located on a substation on site at the power station once stepped up the electricity is transported through high transmission cables  before being stepped down via a transformer on the other end this stepped down electricity is passed onto a regional distribution system such as the overhead cables you might find on top of wooden poles before being stepped down a final time thats the role of a little transformer at the end of your street masters explains finally the electricity is transported via a final cable into your home  this time at 230 volts all this needs to happen incredibly quickly as thousands of kettles are switched on to herald the end of eastenders  the demand of electricity surges delivering that electricity at the touch of a button relies on a complex network but it starts with those inconspicuous few inches of copper at the power
