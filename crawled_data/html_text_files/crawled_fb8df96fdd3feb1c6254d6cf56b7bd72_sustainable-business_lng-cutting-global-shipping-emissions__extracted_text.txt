power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station what is lng and how is it cutting global shipping emissions how freezing cold gas could be key to cleaner waterways  until a postfossil fuel future is possible 5 july 2019 sustainable business shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways share related stories press releases drax welcomes 16 new graduates into career scheme press releases accelerating the development of ccs clusters could
