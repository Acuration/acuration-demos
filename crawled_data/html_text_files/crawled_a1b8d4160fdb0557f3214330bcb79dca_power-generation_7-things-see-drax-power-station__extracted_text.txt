things to see at drax power station getting up close and personal with an industrial powerhouse 4 october 2017 power generation chimneys taller than the london eye domes bigger than the albert hall and enough steel tubing to run the length of the uk twice drax power station is a structure of superlatives but its visiting the site that truly drives home the scale of the electricity generating process from tiny biomass pellets to landscapeshaping cooling towers here are seven of the mostimpressive and interesting parts of drax power station cooling towers arguably the power stations most recognisable landmarks draxs 12 giant cooling towers each measure 114 metres tall to put that in perspective each is large enough to fit the entire statue of liberty inside it  with room to spare these massive concrete structures cool the water used as part of the generation process water is pumped into the tower at roughly 40 degrees celsius and is cooled by air naturally pulled into the structure by its unique shape once the water is cooled it is safely returned to the river ouse so whats coming out the top of a cooling tower water vapour and it only accounts for roughly 2 of all the water pumped into the tower biomass domes standing 65 metres tall draxs four biomass domes are each larger than the royal albert hall and between them hold approximately 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days each dome was constructed by inflating a massive pvc dome  coating its inside with a layer of polyurethane foam and then adding steel and concrete reinforcements because of the sensitive nature of compressed wood pellets the environment inside each dome must be very carefully monitored one of the measures to keep the biomass inert is to feed in nitrogen extracted from the air into the dome  rail unloading bay coals days traversing the uk by train are almost numbered  biomass is taking over its routes compressed wood pellets arrive to english shores at the ports of liverpool  hull and immingham and are then transported across the country in specially designed trains roughly 14 arrive every day collectively unloading about 20000 tonnes of pellets draxs bespoke wagons ensure the wood pellets are kept dry during transportation and unloaded as efficiently as possible this includes a hatch on the bottom of the wagons that is opened magnetically to drop the pellets down into the collection area as they arrive turbine hall heres where the magic happens  its in the turbine hall that electricity is generated biomass is fast replacing coal to be combusted to produce steam which is used to spin massive electromagnets at 3000 rpm inside copper windings which in turn generates electricity with each of the six turbines capable of exporting over 600 megawatts mw into the national grid  the total capacity of drax power station sits just shy of 4000 mw 70 of which now comes from sustainable biomass  an impressive 17 of great britains renewable electricity from this one epic site control room the nerve centre of the power station data from across the plant is fed into the control room giving engineers a view of every stage of the generation process the information displayed across the web of dials and screens around the room shows data on temperatures levels or positioning of equipment and enables operators to monitor and adjust activity around the plant this command and control centre at the heart of drax power station is off the beaten track of most tours  so if seeing it is top of your list please sayso on the tour booking form  as impressive as the control room and on the regular tour is the queens gallery giving a birdseye view over the turbine hall visitor centre first port of call on a tour of drax power station the visitor centre offers an interactive history of drax  from when construction began in the 1960s via coals decline as a fuel source and through to the modern predominantlybiomass power plant of today its here that visitors can step inside the electricity generation process and learn from draxs experienced guides about what happens at the heart of the uks largest power plant the skylark centre and nature reserve away from the noise of the turbine hall a weekend trip to drax also offers the chance to enjoy a peaceful walk through a unique natural environment the skylark centre and nature reserve drax is home to more than 100 species of wildlife including rare and endangered varieties guests might encounter along the reserves nature walks the centre offers the chance to learn more about this environment its inhabitants and the unique story of its creation the reserve is spread across barlow mound a structure created as a means of safely storing the ash created in burning coal at the power station more than 301 million m 3 of ash is safely stored in the current site on top of which grasses and trees have been planted to allow nature to thrive its reinvention into an area of natural beauty reflects the power stations own transformation away from coal  public tours of and visits to drax power station are currently suspended the suspensions are to reduce the risk to businesscritical areas of our operation we are planning to resume tours and visits in 2021 but we cannot guarantee this at the present time please
