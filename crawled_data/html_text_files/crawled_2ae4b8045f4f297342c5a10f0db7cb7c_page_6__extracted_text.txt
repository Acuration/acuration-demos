existing forest certification programmes such as the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council fsc and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc these evidence sustainable forest management practices but do not yet encompass regulatory requirements for reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions  this is a critical gap for biomass generators who are obligated to report ghg emissions to european regulators there is also limited uptake of forestlevel certification schemes in some key forest source areas sbp is working to address these challenges sbp certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met the tool is a unique certification scheme designed for woody biomass mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips used in industrial largescale energy production sbp certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of wood pellet and wood chip producers and biomass traders carried out by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee tags biomass energy  forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy 28 november 2017 sustainable bioenergy biomass is playing an important role in moving the uk away from coal at drax power station in the form of compressed wood pellets  biomass is already supplying roughly 17 of great britains renewable power  but more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network among renewable sources of power biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations  such as frequency control and inertia  this inherrent flexibility is vital in maintaining stability on britains high voltage transmission system wood pellets can also reliably generate power helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine and avoiding reliance on diesel coal and gas however for the uk and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass it must be produced sustainably more than this its supply chain must be low in emissions so that clear savings can be made versus power generation with fossil fuels to ensure this the use of biomass is regulated in the uk under eu timber regulations and the renewables obligation ro  but further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the european parliaments update to the renewable energy directive red which will specify criteria for all biomass there is a clear need for this but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles a new report by drax outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future 1 forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests the sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental social and economic health of that supply region for example a properly managed forest can boost carbon stock as the younger faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more co 2 than older overmature trees thinning operations also increase the growth of the biggest and best trees  ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higherrisk areas where extracting biomass could cause longterm carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss soil erosion or depletion of water sources 2 bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from highrisk feedstocks feedstocks the raw materials turned into biomass pellets must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk in 2016 around 40 of all feedstock supplied to drax originated as a sawmill residue  processes such as thinning also serve as a source of biomass feedstock while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest thinning a semi mature stand of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value sawtimber trees storing more carbon and generating more stable revenue streams having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises land owners to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development 3 carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted to understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy carbon savings need to be measured factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure 4 bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied unlike coal or oil which will eventually run out more trees can be planted grown and harvested that said there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet and so it should not be considered an infinite resource this is why its crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines in short to ensure biomass truly is sustainable it is essential that working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity  5 support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings one of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the uk rapidly adapt to meet the eu target of achieving 27 of final energy consumption from renewables the fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the uks carbon emissions is through converting coal power stations to biomass  as is the case at drax power station this repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources cant quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise 6 the efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets globally there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry byproducts that currently go unused biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained to enable this to function effectively on a global scale trade restrictions should be avoided pelletisation offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe costefficient and lowcarbon to transport around the world these principals are tried and tested by drax and known to protect forests and ecosystems  as well as optimise supply chains to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum ultimately draxs experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems 7 the sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified one of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing thirdparties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with in europe forest level management certification schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by forest europe  outside of europe where drax sources most of its biomass  independent third part auditors can ensure the uks stringent criteria are being met on the ground read the full report the 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass

of mystery for people its within a dark wood that virgil and then dante locate the gates to the underworld while shakespeares magical midsummer nights dream plays out in a mystical forest near athens and while fairies and portals may be the stuff of fantasy the forests that inspired them remain a source of mystery to this day here are five more things you might not know about forests the forest sector employs more than 50 million people around the world employment is one of the major driving forces of global urbanisation as waves of people in both developed and less developed countries head to cities in search of better wages and living standards but outside of cities industries still thrive  particularly forestry which officially employs 132 million people around the world  the world bank even suggests that by counting people in informal forestry employment and those who earn a living indirectly through forests timber or fuel the number of people professionally involved in forestry is closer to 54 million worldwide forestrys total contribution to global gdp is also sizeable it currently adds an impressive 120 billion directly  a number expected to grow by as much as 50 over the next 10 to 15 years even more impressive is the contribution of the wider timber and wood product sector which generates as much as 600 billion  1 of global gdp according to the world bank we will soon be able weigh the worlds forests we know forests blanket about 30 of the land on earth  but what about calculating the mass and volume of all those trees thats a different task entirely but one which could offer important insights for sustainable forestry in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch earth explorer biomass  the first satellite to carry a pband radar which is capable of penetrating the forest canopies and capturing data on the density of tree trunks and branches essentially it will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the result will be a much clearer image of the amount of biomass present around the earths different forested areas and how it is changing over time as a result of carbon dioxide co 2  absorption forests are an energy source that clean up after themselves for all the ikea furniture made from wood 50 of the worlds total wood production is still used for energy with some 24 billion people globally using it for heating cooking and electricity generation the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the annual primary energy consumption making it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand  if it is managed and used in a sustainable way as with other energy sources that are combusted wood releases co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or a sustainable system of growing forests its carbon emissions are offset by new tree plantings which absorb carbon as they grow this means the only emissions produced are those that come from transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predicts that by 2030 forestry mitigation  with the help of carbon pricing  could contribute to co 2 reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes a year  forests improve drinking water forests provide whats known as natural infrastructure which not only regulate water levels but also improve the quality of drinking water root systems and organic material like the leaves and twigs that make up the forest floor absorb water reducing runoff and erosion they also play a part in absorbing nutrients that are harmful to water quality the forest canopy further helps this process by releasing water vapour helping regulate rainfall and providing protection against aerial drifts of pesticides which can filter back into water systems forests can suck up a third of co 2 emissions while governments around the world look to shift to cleaner renewable energy sources and cut emissions forests have been silently tackling climate change for centuries over the past few decades the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global human generated co 2 emissions in fact their ability to deal with fossil fuelderived carbon emissions is even written into the paris climate agreement while natural forests can contribute massively to sequestering absorbing and storing greenhouse gases managed forests can play an even more powerful role younger trees absorb more co 2 to fuel their rapid growth compared to older trees with stored carbon reserves managed forests with regular thinning and replanting of trees ensure there are plentiful numbers of these carbonhungry young trees around the world read the original 5 things you never knew about forests here  tags forests  sustainability keeping the options open 19 october 2017 sustainable bioenergy roughly 750 million acres of the us is covered in forestland  an area nearly 12 times the size of the uk approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets longleaf pine how wood product markets help to conserve a protected species 22 september 2017 sustainable bioenergy longleaf pine forests were once a dominant ecosystem across the southern us gulf and atlantic states spanning from the east coast in virginia as far west as texas however centuries of overuse and conversion to agriculture and to faster growing pine species mean today less than 5 of the estimated 90 million acres remain restoration of the longleaf pine savanna is now underway and the careful management of both public and private forests is key to preserving this ecosystem wood product and biomass markets play an important role in this ensuring there is an economic incentive for landowners to plant highvalue longleaf pines and manage them in a way that promotes conservation an ecosystem shaped by fire the ancient abundance of longleaf pines across the southern us owes to their highly pyrophytic nature meaning they are resistant to fire this allowed the trees to survive both the naturally occurring forest fires from summer thunderstorms and those started as land management by native americans these regular fires help give the longleaf savanna its distinctive features with a limited canopy providing ample sunlight and allowing grasses and herbs to grow in the nitrogenrich soil as colonial settlements expanded across north america the long straight timber offered by the pines as well as the resin and turpentine made these forests a valuable resource longleaf pine ecosystems reached a depleted state the restoration push today americas longleaf restoration initiative alri is taking strides to restore the species the collaborative effort between public and private sector partners has set a 15year goal of increasing longleaf acreage from 34 million to 80 million acres by 2025 these ecosystems are currently home to an estimated 900 endemic plants and 29 federally listed species including the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and indigo snake restoring the environment in which the flora and fauna can flourish is not as simple as planting large numbers of longleaf pine trees conservation efforts must focus on not only the planting of the pine but also the restoration development and maintenance of the pine savanna ecosystem says kyla cheynet a forest ecologist at drax biomass this system requires predictable disturbance to maintain the open canopy and rich herbaceous vegetation the role of the wood product market these disturbances include prescribed fires and the careful harvesting of trees to ensure the landscape maintains its open canopy that allows plenty of sunlight to reach the grasses and other vegetation along the forest floor the alris 2016 report highlighted the importance of thinning and prescribed fires in conserving longleaf savanna it found that while new planting of longleaf pines declined slightly 8 from 2015 the wildlife quality plant diversity and overall health of forests improved by removing competing tree species and allowing more sunlight to enter the forest harvesting or thinning longleaf pine forests provides a small percentage of the fibre used to manufacture compressed wood pellets used at drax power station but these markets help to incentivise responsible forest management and offer a source of profit for landowners these revenuegenerating practices are crucial to ensuring the continued survival of longleaf pine forests by preventing them from being converted to agricultural land or lost to development  tags forests  sustainability how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power on our shores tags investors  railways and trains  supply chain  sustainability what is a working forest 1 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy for centuries civilizations have relied on forests and forest products forests provided fuel food and construction materials and there were plenty of them but when in 18 th century europe the needs of growing industrialisation sent development into overdrive a problem arose forests were struggling to meet demand in germany the problem was acute the growing steel industry had increased demand for wood to power its smelters and for wood used in mining operations large areas of forestland were stripped to meet industrys needs and overall supply was quickly decreasing no one was more acutely aware of the challenge than hans carl von carlowitz who at the time was the head of the saxon mining administration so in 1713 he published silvicultura oeconomica a book which advocated the conservation and management of german forests so they could provide for industries in the long term although he drew on existing knowledge from around europe it was the first time an important term was used nachhaltigkeit the german word for sustainability  carlowitz explained this new term conservation and growing of wood is to be undertaken in order to have a continuing stable and sustained use as this is an indispensable cause without which the country in its essence cannot remain it was arguably the start of the scientific approach to forestry and although our needs of forests have changed as have the words we use to describe them  working forest plantation forest and managed forest all refer to largely the same thing that same principle is at the heart of how a modern working forest functions to ensure what exists and is useful today will still be there tomorrow this approach relies on responsible forest management which sets out a few key principles on how a forest should be managed to sustain its life providing room to breathe working forests are commonly managed to produced sawlogs  high value wood that can be sawn to make timber for construction or furniture for a forester to optimise the quality and quantity of sawlogs regular thinning is required thinning is the process of periodically felling a proportion of the forest to aid its overall health and vigour this means there are fewer trees fighting for the same resources water sunshine soil more than that thinning can promote diversity by providing more light and space for other flora thinning can occur several times in a forests cycle it can be used to increase the size and quality of the remaining trees and also to encourage new seedlings to establish in place of the harvested trees when managing for continuous forest cover httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201705whatisaworkingforestfinalmp4 nothing should be wasted the roundwood produced by thinning is often too small to be sold as sawlogs but that doesnt mean its worthless it can be sold to the pulp industry to make paper or for particleboard or to the biomass industry to make compressed wood pellets  which can be used to fuel power generation  as is done at drax power station  these industries also provide a market for the lower grade roundwood removed when the more mature trees are finally harvested in areas where there was no robust market for this low grade wood it would often be left on site and become a fire risk or a haven for pest and disease attack too much low grade material left on site can also inhibit the regrowth of the next tree crop so markets for this material are important for the health of the forest and the value of the land to the forest owner also in the baltic countries markets for pulpwood are limited and the energy sector provides a valuable opportunity to clear the site for replanting and provide additional revenue to the forest owner this process of utilising all parts of the forest is essential for a healthy working forest on the one hand the revenue can cover the cost of thinning this husbandry enhances the quality of the final tree crop and ensures that money is available to invest in future planting and regeneration ensuring the forest area is consistently maintained and improved young regeneration in a shelterwood system demonstrating the continuous forest lifecycle the carbon benefits of a working forest rather than diminishing it actively managing a forest helps its ability to sequester  or absorb and store  more carbon  carbon sequestration is directly related to the growth rate of a tree  a young growing tree absorbs more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than an older one  older trees will have more carbon stored after a childhood spent absorbing it but if these are not harvested they are more susceptible to fire damage pests and diseases and their carbon absorption plateaus in an actively managed forest older trees ready for sawlog production can be harvested and replaced with vigorously growing young trees and in the process maximise the co 2 absorption potential of the forest the byproducts of this process  the low grade wood and thinnings  can be used for the pulp and biomass industry which both aids the health of the remaining forest and provides revenue for the forester to invest in the long term life of his or her forest  three centuries of sustainability in the 300 years since carlowitz published his book on sustainability a lot has changed and while its unlikely he foresaw forests providing fuel for renewable electricity and renewable heat  the approach remains as relevant what is a working forest it is one that is as productive and healthy tomorrow as it is today that were using the same resource today as we were 300 years ago is evidence to suggest its a practice that works tags forests  investors  sustainability how space tech helps forests 20 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing

is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags biomass energy  investors  sustainability  technology  1
