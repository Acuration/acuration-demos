Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships
Our apprenticeship schemes offer you the chance to learn, develop new skills and kick-start your career.
They are an opportunity to gain experience within our business while acquiring transferable skills. Apprenticeships vary in length from 1 – 6 years, dependent upon the type and level of apprenticeship.
We offer apprenticeships in several different business areas, for example Customer Services, Supply Chain & Logistics, Business Administration  together with Engineering (through our Technical/Craft apprenticeship schemes).  All opportunities are advertised on our
current vacancies page
.

Starting your career as a Drax Apprentice
Our apprenticeship schemes have many success stories, with former apprentices promoted within the business and continuing to develop their career within the Drax group.  Members of our Senior Leadership Team and Executive Committee started as apprentices.
As a Drax apprentice you will receive a considerable amount of support from your manager, mentor/buddy, and the Early Careers Team.  They’ll work closely with your training provider to ensure your apprenticeship equips you for your future career.  In addition to the specific experience and development relating to your apprenticeship, you’ll receive core skills development to prepare you for the world of work and your future career.
Drax works hard to recognise the achievements of its apprentices and holds annual apprenticeship awards to celebrate their success.
2022 Drax Apprentice Award Winners: (L-R) Sam Easthill, Sam Plumb, James Taylor, Simran Ley, Bruce Heppenstall, Patrick Harpham, Declan Farmer and Luke Crossland

Overview of the Technical/Craft Apprenticeship Schemes
Selection Process
Qualification requirements
We look for apprentices who share our values and want to join in the success of a company with a great future.
There is no age restriction or age limit for the Drax Apprenticeship Scheme.
If successful, you’ll be asked to provide evidence proving all the academic/vocational qualifications stated in your application form, whether required for the role or not. Do not claim a qualification in your application if you cannot do this. If you apply based on predicted grades you must achieve the required standard to confirm your appointment.
Application form
Applications for our apprenticeship schemes open throughout the year; however, vacancies are generally posted in December, January and February. All candidates apply via our
recruitment system
.
Prior to completing an application form, you’ll be asked several questions before being progressed to the form itself.
You are required to complete all sections of the application form (unless stated ‘optional’)
For applicants who have not yet completed their GCSEs/National Qualifications please provide predicted grades under the ‘Education’ section.
The application form may take up to one hour to complete, so please make sure you allocate sufficient time to complete it.
Aptitude tests
If you are shortlisted, you may be asked to complete a number of online aptitude tests which measure both technical and comprehension reasoning. Details of the tests will be sent to you via email.
Interview
If you are successful following the aptitude tests, you’ll be asked to attend an interview. Any specific interview requirements will be sent to you prior to the interview.
Final selection and start date
For successful candidates a provisional offer will be made subject to attaining the necessary qualifications. The schemes usually start mid- to end-of August/early September each year.
Email communication
Most communication during the application process will be made via email, therefore please ensure you enter your email address correctly and you have access to your email account during the application period.
Can I apply for the scheme again?
If you have previously applied for a place on the apprentice scheme and were unsuccessful then you can apply again. It is important to ensure you demonstrate how you have developed since you last applied, for example, any additional qualifications you have attained, or work experience you have undertaken.
