investors updated expectations for full year 2022 6 july 2022 investors rns number  5930r drax group plc drax or the group symboldrx in response to increased pressure on european gas markets and associated concerns about electricity security of supply in the uk this winter drax continues to optimise its biomass generation and logistics to accomplish this drax is reprofiling biomass generation and supply from the summer to the winter enabling it to provide high levels of reliable renewable electricity generation in the uk throughout the winter when demand is likely to be higher the group also expects to provide additional support from pumped storage hydro at cruachan power station building on a strong year to date performance which reflects a high level of system support activities separately at the request of the uk government drax has now entered into an agreement with national grid  in its capacity as the electricity systems operator  pursuant to which its two coalfired units at drax power station will remain available to provide a winter contingency service to the uk power system from october 2022 until the end of march 2023 the units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and only operate if and when instructed to do so by national grid under the terms of the agreement drax will be paid a fee for the service and compensated for costs incurred including coal costs in connection with the operation of the coal units in accordance with the agreement full year expectations reflecting these factors drax now expects that full year adjusted ebitda 1 for 2022 will be slightly above the top of the range of analyst expectations 2  subject to continued good operational performance notes  1 earnings before interest tax depreciation amortisation excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements 2 as of 5 july 2022 analyst consensus for 2022 adjusted ebitda was 613 million with a range of 584635 million the

security of supply in the uk this winter the uk government has asked owners of legacy coalfired generation assets including drax to work together with national grid to temporarily extend the life of their coal generation assets to march 2023 at the request of the uk government drax has now entered into an agreement with national grid  in its capacity as the electricity systems operator  pursuant to which its two coalfired units at drax power station will remain available to provide a winter contingency service to the uk power system from october 2022 until the end of march 2023 the units will

and compensated for costs incurred including coal costs in connection with the operation of the coal units in accordance with the agreement will gardiner draxs group ceo said at the request of the uk government drax has agreed to delay the planned closure of its two coalfired units and help bolster the uks energy security this winter drax has played a central role in ensuring britains energy security over several decades and our workforce is proud to be providing this critical support to the uk energy system drax is the uks largest generator of renewable power producing enough reliable renewable electricity for 5 million households from our sustainable biomass and hydro operations and we remain committed to delivering a coalfree future the uks longterm energy security depends on investment in innovative green technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which provides reliable renewable power whilst permanently removing co 2 from the atmosphere drax aims to invest billions of pounds developing beccs in the uk by 2030 provided that the uk government has in place policies to support the feasibility and delivery of negative emissions technologies which it has committed to developing this year drax ended commercial operations on its tworemaining coalfired generation units in march 2021 and formal closure was planned for september 2022 following the fulfilment of the groups capacity market obligations on these units a limited sixmonth extension to march 2023 is not expected to result in a material level of coal generation 1  throughout 2021 coalfired generation accounted for 3 of the groups generation output and in the first three months of 2022 this was less than 1 with the balance from renewables  sustainable biomass pumped storage and hydro the decision to end coal generation supports the groups purpose of enabling a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and the transition to a flexible renewable generation model this has led to a more than 95 reduction in the groups scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions since 2012 and enabled drax to become the uks largest source of renewable electricity by output investment in renewables to date drax has invested over 2 billion in renewables and uk security of supply with options for a further 3 billionto be invested this decade subject to the right investment environment these investment options include the development of negative emissions technologies and pumped storage which the uk government has said are necessary to decarbonise the electricity generation sector by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050 no expected impact on beccs drax continues to expect to take a final investment decision on its drax power station beccs project in 2024 subject to the right investment environment and in 2022 is investing incrementally in the development of this option this includes the removal of certain coal infrastructure a sixmonth extension of coal is not expected to impact on the timing of a final investment decision or intended commissioning date for the project site preparation works for beccs are ongoing and will accelerate following formal closure of the coal units in march 2023 the uk government recognises the important role which beccs has to play in delivering net zero requiring at least 5mt of co 2 per year from beccs and other engineered greenhouse gas removals ggr by 2030 to support this ambition in july 2022 the uk government published a consultation on engineered ggrs separately in order to develop the financial model required to support beccs  and reflective of its advanced technological readiness and the cobenefits of both power and negative emissions  the uk government is expected to publish a power beccs business model consultation during summer 2022 the group believes that negative emissions and beccs represent a trilliondollar global market opportunity and is separately continuing to develop options to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 notes  1 drax will work with national grid to source up to approximately 400000 tonnes of additional coal which together with current stocks is enough for c1twh of electricity generation to deliver the service and will only operate if and when instructed to do so by national grid enquiries drax investor relations mark

emissions for the uk and pioneer beccs technology at scale beccs is a vital carbon removals technology that the uns ipcc says is needed globally to achieve net zero with the right government support drax is ready to invest 3bn this decade in delivering vital renewable energy technologies including beccs a carbon removal technology that is costeffective but also the only one that generates reliable renewable electricity while removing millions of tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere pellet production in april 2022 the group completed the commissioning of its 360kt plant at demopolis alabama and its 40kt satellite plant in leola arkansas the group is also currently constructing a second 40kt satellite plant at russellville arkansas allowing greater utilisation of lower cost sawmill residues whilst leveraging on existing infrastructure in the us southeast leola satellite plant under construction february 2022 once at full capacity these developments alongside incremental capacity expansions at existing sites will increase nameplate production capacity to around 5mt pa over 2mt pa of production is contracted to highquality thirdparties under longterm contracts with the balance available to drax to fulfil its ownuse requirements strong demand for forest products in construction and manufacturing markets continues to support good fibre residue availability with no material change in fibre cost drax notes an incremental increase in transportation costs in north america principally related to truck driver shortages and haulage costs the group continues to target a final investment decision fid on up to 1mt of new capacity in 2022 as part of its plans to increase total pellet production capacity to 8mt by 2030 generation in the uk the groups biomass hydro and pumped storage assets have continued to play an important role in security of supply providing stability to the uk power system at a time when higher gas prices and interconnector availability have placed the system under increased pressure to maximise renewable output at times of high demand the group is continuing to optimise biomass generation across all four biomass units at drax power station contributing to an increase in average achieved power prices the current power price environment increases the importance of appropriate investment to ensure good operational performance and availability and in march and april 2022 two biomass units underwent planned maintenance outages the units contracted positions in this period were bought back and the generation reprofiled with no net change in output over the roc compliance period draxs two legacy coal units were called into the balancing mechanism by the system operator in january for limited operations to support security of supply these shortterm measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and did not result in any material increase in the groups total carbon emissions drax continues to expect to formally close these two legacy coal units following the fulfilment of their capacity market obligations in september 2022 but remains committed to supporting security of supply in the uk drax has recently been asked by the uk government to consider options for a limited extension of its coal operations and this remains under review generation contracted power sales the group has continued to add to its forward power sales book as at 22 april 2022 drax had 222twh of power hedged between 2022 and 2024 on its roc and hydro generation assets at an average price of 781mwh a further 18twh equivalent of gas hedges have been contracted in 2023 and 2024 for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward power sales from the roc units these contracts are highly

belarussian biomass which it has now removed from its supply chain the biomass that drax uses comes from stable sustainable markets in north america and europe and is sourced under longterm fixed formula contracts the removal of russian biomass cargoes from european supply chains has led to higher prices and lower availability in the small european spot market adding incremental costs and limiting the potential to source additional cargoes to support incrementally higher levels of generation in 2022 full year expectations reflecting these factors the group now expects that full year

ceo drax group click to viewdownload drax has made excellent progress during 2021 providing a firm foundation for further growth we have advanced our beccs project  a vital part of the east coast cluster that was recently selected to be one of the uks two priority ccs projects and were now setting out a strategy to take the business forward enabling drax to make an even greater contribution to global efforts to reach net zero we believe drax can deliver growth and become a global leader in sustainable biomass and negative emissions and a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation we aim to double our sustainable biomass production capacity by 2030  creating opportunities to double our sales to asia and europe where demand for biomass is increasing as countries transition away from coal as a global leader in negative emissions were going to scale up our ambitions internationally drax is now targeting 12 million tonnes of carbon removals each year by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this includes the negative emissions we can deliver at drax power station in the uk and through potential newbuild beccs projects in north america and europe supporting a new sector of the economy which will create jobs clean growth and exciting export opportunities capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the groups strategy market opportunities and development projects the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees to grow its biomass supply chain biomass sales and beccs as well as longterm dispatchable generation from biomass and pumped storage purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies which increasingly recognise the unique role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change strategic pillars to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets to be a global leader in negative emissions to be a leader in uk dispatchable renewable generation the development of these pillars remains underpinned by the groups continued focus on safety sustainability and biomass cost reduction a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets drax believes that the global market for sustainable biomass will grow significantly creating opportunities for sales to third parties in asia and europe beccs generation and other longterm uses of biomass delivery of these opportunities is supported by the expansion of the groups biomass pellet production capacity the group has 13 operational pellet plants with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further two plants currently commissioning and other developmentsexpansions which will increase this to c5mt once complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity to deliver this additional capacity drax is developing a pipeline of organic projects principally focused on north america drax expects to take a final investment decision on 051mt of new capacity in 2022 targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital underpinned by this expanded production capacity drax aims to double sales of biomass to third parties to 4mt pa by 2030 developing its market presence in asia and europe facilitated by the creation of new business development teams in tokyo and london drax is a major producer supplier and user of biomass active in all areas of the supply chain with longterm relationships and almost 20 years of experience in biomass operations the groups innovation in coaltobiomass engineering supply chain management and leadership in negative emissions can be deployed alongside its large reliable and sustainable supply chain to support customer decarbonisation journeys with longterm partnerships drax expects to sell all the biomass it produces based on an appropriate market price typically with longterm indexlinked contracts continued focus on cost reduction in 2018 the groups biomass production cost was 166t 2  at the h1 2021 results through a combination of fibre sourcing operational improvements and capacity expansion including the acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc the production cost had reduced to 141t 2  draxs aims to use the combined expertise of drax and pinnacle to apply learnings and cost savings across its portfolio and continues to target 100t 2 50mwh equivalent 4  by 2027 a global leader in negative emissions the intergovernmental panel on climate change 5 and the coalition for negative emissions 6 have both outlined a clear role for beccs in delivering the negative emissions required to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels and to achieve net zero by 2050 identifying a requirement of between 2bn and 7bn tonnes of negative emissions globally from beccs separately the uk government has recently published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support beccs to meet these requirements subject to the right regulatory environment drax plans to transform drax power station into the worlds biggest carbon capture project using beccs to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 emissions from the atmosphere each year by 2030 the project is well developed the technology is proven and an investment decision could be taken in 2024 with the first beccs unit operational in 2027 and a second in 2030 subject to the right investment framework the group aims to build on this innovation with a new target to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions pa from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation the uks plans to achieve net zero by 2050 will require the electrification of heating and transport systems resulting in a significant increase in demand for electricity drax believes that over 80 of this could be met by intermittent renewable and inflexible lowcarbon energy sources  wind solar and nuclear however this will only be possible if the remaining power sources can provide the dispatchable power and nongeneration system support services the power system requires to ensure security of supply and to limit the cost to the consumer longterm biomass generation and pumped storage hydro can provide these increasingly important services drax power station is the uks largest source of renewable power by output and the largest dispatchable plant the group is continuing to develop a lower cost operating model for this asset supported by a reduction in fixed costs associated with the end of coal operations drax is also developing an option for new pumped storage  cruachan ii  which could take a final investment decision in 2024 and be operational by 2030 providing an additional 600mw of dispatchable longduration storage to the power system in its smart systems and flexibility plan july 2021 the uk government described longduration storage technologies as essential for achieving net zero and has committed to take actions to derisk investment for largescale and longduration storage capital allocation and dividend strategic capital investment 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity beccs at drax power station and cruachan ii is expected to be in the region of 3bn between 2022 and 2030 backed by longterm contracted cashflows and targeting high singledigit returns and above no final investment decision has been taken on any of these projects and both beccs and cruachan ii remain subject to further clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms the group believes these investments can be selffunded through strong cash generation over the period with net debt to adjusted ebitda significantly below 2x at the end of 2030 providing flexibility to support further investment such as newbuild beccs as these options develop drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 noting that average annual dividend growth was around 10 in the last 5years webcast and presentation material the event will be webcast from 1000am and the material made available on the groups website from 700am joining instructions for the webcast and

group has made good progress integrating pinnacle renewable energy inc pinnacle since acquisition in april 2021 and is currently in the final stages of commissioning over 360kt of new production capacity at demopolis alabama in october 2021 the group commissioned a 150kt expansion at its lasalle plant in louisiana and at leola arkansas a new 40kt satellite plant is due to be commissioned in december these developments alongside incremental new capacity in 2022 support the groups continued focus on production capacity expansion and cost reduction once fully commissioned drax will operate around 5mt of production capacity across three major north american fibre baskets  british columbia alberta and the us southeast of which around 2mt are contracted to highquality thirdparty counterparties under longterm contracts with the balance available for draxs ownuse requirements there has been no disruption to ownuse or thirdparty volumes from the global supply chain delays currently being experienced in some other sectors however as outlined at the groups 2021 half year results summer wildfires led to pellet export restrictions in canada more recently heavy rainfall and flooding in british columbia have led to some further disruption to rail movements and regional supply chains through its enlarged and diversified supply chain drax has been able to manage and limit the impact on biomass supply for ownuse and to customers in addition due to the groups active and longterm hedging of freight costs there has been no material impact associated with higher market prices for ocean freight the group uses longterm contracts to hedge its freight exposure on biomass for its generation business and following the acquisition of pinnacle is taking steps to optimise freight requirements between production centres in the us southeast and western canada and end markets in asia and europe generation in the uk the groups biomass and pumped storage generation assets have continued to play an important role providing stability to the uk power system at a time when higher gas prices european interconnector issues and periods of low wind have placed the system under increased pressure the groups strong forward sold position means that it has not been a significant beneficiary of higher power prices from these activities in 2021 but has been able to increase forward hedged prices in 2022 and 2023 in march the groups two legacy coal units ended commercial generation activities and will formally close in september 2022 following the fulfilment of their capacity market obligations reflecting the system challenges described above these units were called upon in the balancing mechanism by the system operator for limited operations in september and november these shortterm measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and have not resulted in any material increase in the groups total carbon emissions in september the generation business experienced a twoweek unplanned outage on one biomass unit operating under the roc scheme the units contracted position in this period was bought back and the generation reprofiled across the two unaffected biomass roc units and deferred until the fourth quarter during this period the groups pumped storage power station cruachan provided risk mitigation from the operational or financial impact of any additional forced outages in november the generation business successfully completed a major 98 day planned outage on its biomass cfd unit which included the third in a series of highpressure turbine upgrades drax now expects the unit to benefit from thermal efficiency improvements and lower maintenance costs incrementally reducing the cost of biomass generation at drax power station customers the group continues to expect the customers business will return to profitability at the adjusted ebitda level for 2021 inclusive of an expected increase in mutualisation costs associated with the failure of a number of energy supply businesses in the second half of 2021 separately the group is continuing to assess operational and strategic solutions to support the development of the sme 5 supply business full year expectations reflecting these factors the group now expects that full year adjusted ebitda for 2021 will be around the top of the range of current analyst expectations 6  subject to good operational performance during december including baseload running of all four biomass units the groups financial expectations do not include any balancing mechanism activity in december for the coal units drax continues to expect net debt to adjusted ebitda to return to around 2x by the end of 2022 negative emissions in october the uk
