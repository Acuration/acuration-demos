drax power station how to switch a power station off coal 22 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy in 2003 the uks biggest coal power station took its first steps away from the fossil fuel which defined electricity generation for more than a century it was in that year that drax power station began cofiring biomass as a renewable alternative to coal it symbolised the beginnings of the power stations ambitious transformation from fossilfuel stalwart to the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator this plan presented a massive engineering challenge for drax with significant amounts of new knowledge quickly needed fifteen years later three of its generating units now run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of biomass while coal has been relegated to stepping in only to cover spikes in demand and improve system stability  now drax has converted a fourth unit from coal to biomass this development represents the passing of a two thirds marker for the power stations coalfree ambitions and adds 600plus megawatts mw of renewable electricity to great britains national transmission system  building on the past drax first converted a coal unit to biomass in 2013 with two more following in 2014 and 2016 this put drax in an interesting position going into a new conversion on one hand it is one of the most experienced generators in the world when it comes to dealing with and upgrading to biomass on the other its still relatively new to the low carbon fuel compared with its dealings with coal adam nicholson weve decades of understanding of how to use coal but weve only been operating with biomass since we started the full conversion trials in 2011 says adam nicholson section head for process performance at drax power weve got few running hours under our belts with the new fuel versus the hundreds of man years of coal knowledge and operation all around the country when converting a generating unit the steam turbine and generator itself remain the same the difference is all in the material being delivered stored crushed and blown into the boiler and burned to heat up water and create steam and because biomass can be a volatile substance  much more so than coal  this process must be a careful one drax could build on the learnings and equipment it had already developed for biomass such as specially built trains and pulverising mills  but storage proved a bigger issue the giant biomass domes at drax that make up the ecostore are advanced technological structures carefully attuned to storing biomass but for unit 4 they were off limits instead drax engineers had to come up with another solution the journey of a pellet through the power station normally wood pellets are brought into drax by train unloaded and stored in the biomass domes before travelling through the power station to the mills and then boilers  unit 4 however sits in the second half of the station  built 12 years after the first this slight change in location presented a problem theres no link from the eco store to unit 4 at all explains nicholson you cant use the storage domes and that whole infrastructure to get anything to unit 4 drax engineers set about designing a new conveyor system that could connect the domes to the mills and boiler that powers unit 4 after weeks of design the team had a theoretical plan to connect the two locations with one problem it was entirely uneconomical rail unloading building 1 and storage silos if we were building a new plant it would be relatively easy because you could plan properly and wouldnt have existing equipment in the way says nicholson we had to plan around it and make use of the preexisting plant within that preexisting plant though were vital pieces of equipment some of which had laid dormant since drax stopped fuelling its boilers with a mixture of coal and biomass and opted instead for full unit conversions drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003 using two different materials  a mix of around 5 biomass and 95 coal a direct injection facility was added in 2005 it involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power stations 60 mills  then the amount of renewable power drax was able to generate roughly doubled in the summer of 2010 when a 400 mw cofiring facility became operational back to the present day its fortunate for the unit 4 conversion that the cofiring facility includes its own rail unloading building rub 1 and storage silos they are located much closer to the unit than the bigger rub 2 and the massive biomass domes this solved the problem of storage but moving the required volumes of biomass through the plant without significant transport construction still posed a challenge rail unloading building 1 and storage silos for unit 4 left ecostore biomass domes for units 13 right to tackle this the team modified a pneumatic transport system previously tested during cofiring to have the capability to blow entire pellets from the storage facilities around the power station at speeds of more than 20 metres per second the success of this system proved key  it was the final piece necessary to make the conversion of unit 4 economical  the postcoal future andy koss for now draxs fifth and sixth generating unit remain coalpowered but are called upon less frequently with great britain set to go completely coalfree by 2025 there are plans to convert these too but as part of a system of combined cycle gas turbines and giant batteries rather than biomass powered units its an opportunity for drax to again leverage its preexisting plant and provide the grid with a fast actingsource of lowercarbon electricity as with converting to biomass it will pose a complex new engineering challenge  one that will prepare drax to meet the future needs of grid as it continues to change and demand greater flexibility from generators the speed at which the unit 4 project has been delivered is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we continue to see at drax were nimble and innovative enough to meet future challenges says andy koss chief executive drax power we may look very different in 10 or 20 years time but the ethos of that innovation and agility is something that will persist repowering the remaining coal plant with gas and up to 200 mw of batteries will sit alongside research into areas such as carbon capture use and storage ccus that is all geared towards expanding drax power beyond a single site generator into a portfolio of flexible power production facilities unit 4s conversion is more than just a step beyond halfway for the power stations decarbonisation but a significant step towards becoming entirely coalfree  find out more about unit 4  tags biomass energy  technology  drax power station  coal  investors drax a rail history 5 july 2018 power generation railways in great britain today are often seen as unreliable or chaotic yet they remain a vital part of the lives of the population and the economy of the country when rail transport first arrived in earnest in the 19 th century it suddenly allowed goods from around the world as well as people to quickly cross the country it reshaped perceptions of the countrys geography unlocked the population and accelerated industries over time however the role of the railways has diminished owing largely to the massive rise in car ownership and the shifting of freight onto the road but that is not to say it has completely lost its importance with 6000 trains passing through drax power station every year rail is still integral to drax and the region around it in fact since the very first introduction of the railways to the region it has played a major part in shaping the landscape a village with two stations before the construction of the power station or nationalisation of the railways drax village was wellconnected with two different railway lines running through it the north eastern railway ner selby to goole line and the hull and barnsley railways doncaster to hull line each of these lines ran through a different station with ner calling at drax hales station while hull and barnsley called at drax abbey station but following nationalisation and british rails modernisation plans drax abbey station which had closed to passengers in 1931 closed to goods traffic in 1959 drax hales station followed suit in 1964 when it was closed as part of what became known as the beeching axe british rail chairman richard beeching famously carried out a review of britains railways in the 60s and as a result closed vast quantities of  what he considered  uneconomical lines explains andrew christian fgd  byproducts section head at drax power station and expert on the areas history at that time oil was cheap people were increasingly using cars and motorways were being constructed nobody really foresaw the rail demand that would be needed in the future to serve the power station daleks on a merrygoround in the 1960s and 70s with the planning and construction of drax power station underway there was a new need for railways in bringing coal from the new selby coalfield this resulted in the reopening of a closed part of the hull and barnsley line for four miles from a reinstated junction at hensall known as hensall junction it was renamed drax power station branch junction and later shorted to drax branch junction a rail system known as a mgr loop was installed on the power station grounds which allows trains to loop around the station and deposit coal  today also wood pellets  without stopping the merrygoround trains as they are known were originally made up of 40 fourwheeled merrygoround mgr hopper wagons these were much smaller than the wagons that carry biomass from ports to power stations today and more than 11000 mgrs where built to serve coal power stations around great britain photo by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power station the opentopped wagons were each capable of carrying 33 tonnes of pulverised coal which was automatically released thanks to a piece of machinery alongside the track colloquially known as daleks thanks to their resemblance to the dr who villain but as the power station began to change and evolved to fit the modern world so too did the railway serving it rail at drax beyond coal  the original drax rail loop was a single track with three coal unloading points by 1993 there was 145 km of track with 27 sets of points and crossings allowing trains to switch rails thanks to the double tracked loop and extra tracks laid to serve traffic taking limestone in and gypsum out from the power station this was further expanded with the introduction of biomass and a new double track and unloading facility in 2013 the biomass trains are specially designed to keep compressed wood pellets dry and they are much longer than their mgr predecessors at 182 meters long their capacity is 30 greater than a coal wagon it means the 23wagon trains bringing biomass to the power stations from tyne hull immingham and liverpools ports are a quarter of a mile long it might be a far cry from the heyday in which the railways crisscrossed the region but they remain a vital part of the area and while the areas original lines are now 50 years dormant their remnants are still visible in the lasting impact theyve left on the surrounding landscape many of the embankments and bridges found in and around drax stem from those first railway lines while much of the a645 road that was constructed in the early 1990s runs along the track bed of ners route to goole photos by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power stati on the trains might not stop in drax village anymore but they remain a vital part of the landscape and how its powered northern powerhouse minister jake berry was in yorkshire on 5 july 2018 to unveil the first drax freight wagons with northern powerhouse branding to deliver biomass to the power station read more tags supply chain  drax power station  history  railways and trains  transport the night shift 21 june 2018 power generation things are different at night as darkness falls the familiar sights and sounds that make up daily life retreat creating a strange yet familiar world theres less activity but that doesnt mean there is no activity while great britain sleeps phones charge and fridges hum electricity is a 24hour need and so the stations generating it must be 24hour operations but the life of a power station by night is very different to that by day walking around the power station at night can almost feel like the mary celeste says simon acaster drax power stations generation manager there may be as few as 50 to 60 people on site which isnt a lot when you consider the size of the plant and compare it to the day when there are some 650 people around drax power station by day is a hive of activity alongside generation there are maintenance engineering  trading and contract support at night this is all stripped back work is focused on the core production issues looking after the asset and maintaining power generation output to meet our contract position keeping the teams safe and making sure we stay environmentally compliant  says mark rhodes shift manager at drax its a quieter place he adds keeping power flowing typically teams at drax swap over at 8pm and 8am on a cycle of day and night shifts during the summer months when one or more of the stations six 600 megawatt mw units can be on outage and maintenance is carried out across the station work often continues around the clock right through the night but during a period of normal operation the night workforce is reduced to basic operations and maintenance teams material handling teams receiving biomass deliveries  which continue through the night  and security staff  demand for electricity typically falls overnight so drax shuts down unneeded generation units around 10pm as morning approaches teams prep them to restart in time for when people wake up and turn on kettles  even when we shut the units down the turbine is still turning throughout the night says acaster all the hydraulic pumps and lube oil systems are still functioning a lot of plant is in service even when the units are shut down this means theres still the potential as during the day for something to need maintenance or attention at any moment requiring the teams to jump into action we aim to sort any shortterm issues through the night says rhodes but for any technical issues that can wait we tackle them when the day team returns and were fully staffed at night its more about safely managing the asset the hardest part of a running the power station overnight however is not a technical one its a human one theres no doubt about it working nights is tiring says acaster the biggest challenge is keeping everybody focused and aware of whats happening he continues unit controllers regularly talk to their plant operators checking in every hour so we know theyre safe supervisors need to be out on plant engaging and talking to employees checking on what theyre doing and keeping them active and alert the shifting of the night shift the decarbonisation of great britains electricity system has changed the way drax operates during the day and the same is true of the night historically we had six units and they would be baseload generating 645 mw each says rhodes they would operate continuously day and night but with the demand profile changing  lower power prices and other methods of generation coming onto the system  that model is changing overnight is normally the time of least demand and when the price of power becomes most depressed rhodes continues so we take units off and prepare them for the morning returning when there is value regularly shutting down and starting the units takes a tougher toll on the equipment than running them continuously which increases the need for maintenance teams on night shifts theres also a need for teams to be on standby to ramp up or down generation  the increased volatility of the countrys power network brought on in part by increasing levels of intermittent renewables means national grid can often ask drax to increase or decrease generation at short notice to provide balancing services like inertia frequency response or reserve power  our units can come down to 300 mw and stay at that level says acaster across three units that gives national grid 900 mw of spare capacity that can be turned up its like a sleeping giant awaiting start up at any time but unlike other sleeping giants this one is never truly at rest the demands of the network keep it and the men and women operating it humming through the night 24hours a day the power station at night is a quieter place but it is never a silent one tags power station  engineering  drax power station  flexibility and stability and power system security chief executives review will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 annual report market background the uk is undergoing an energy revolution  a transition to a lowcarbon economy requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy through our flexible lower carbon electricity proposition and business to business b2b energy solutions the group is positioning itself for growth in this environment more details can be seen on page 4 of our annual report  our strategy our purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used through addressing uk energy needs and those of our customers our strategy is designed to deliver growing earnings and cash flow alongside significant cash returns for shareholders our ambition is to grow our ebitda to over 425 million by 2025 with over a third of those earnings coming from pellet production and b2b energy supply to create a broader more balanced earnings profile we intend to pay a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders progression towards these targets is underpinned by safety sustainability operational excellence and expertise in our markets summary of 2017 we made significant progress during 2017 but were below our expectations on the challenging scorecard targets we set ourselves in pellet production and biomass availability the latter reflecting the significant incident we experienced on our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2017 which extended into january 2018 energy supply performed well with opus energy in line with plan and haven power exceeding its targets through a combination of this performance and the progress of our strategy we have delivered ebitda of 229 million significantly ahead of 2016 140 million and with each of our three businesses contributing positive ebitda for the first time the group scorecard is reported in full in the remuneration report  pp 81107 of our annual report  and the kpis are also shown below they reflect the diversity of our operations and our need to maintain clear focus on delivering operational excellence on a statutory basis we recorded a loss of 151 million which reflects unrealised losses on derivative contracts previously announced accounting policy on the accelerated depreciation on coalspecific assets as well as amortisation of newly acquired intangible assets in opus energy we also calculate underlying earnings a profit after tax of 27 million which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and to assess the performance of the group without the income statement volatility introduced by noncash fair value adjustments on our portfolio of forward commodity and currency futures contracts during the year we refinanced our existing debt facilities reducing our debt cost we also confirmed a new dividend policy which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend 50 million in respect of 2017 consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth at year end our net debt was 91 million below our 2x net debt to ebitda target providing additional headroom there is more detail on our financial performance in the group financial review on page 46 of our annual report  in the us our pellet production operations recorded yearonyear growth in output of 35 with our first two plants now producing at full capacity during the second half of 2017 we also completed the installation of additional capacity enabling our morehouse and amite facilities to handle a greater amount of residue material supporting efforts to produce good quality pellets at the lowest cost as part of our target to expand our biomass selfsupply capability we completed the acquisition of lasalle bioenergy lasalle adding pellet production capacity lasalle commenced commissioning in november 2017 and due to its close proximity to our existing us facilities once complete will provide further opportunities for supply chain optimisation as in 2016 we benefited from the flexibility of selfsupply this often overlooked attribute of our supply chain enables us to manage biomass supply across the power generation business planned outage season and to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the shortterm spot market in power generation we experienced a significant incident on our biomass rail unloading facilities including a small fire on a section of conveyor we fully investigated the incident and following repairs over the christmas period have now recommissioned the facility with enhanced operating procedures this is a timely reminder of the combustible nature of biomass and the need for strong controls and processes to protect our people and assets our biomass units continued to produce high levels of renewable electricity from sustainable wood pellets for the uk market  drax produced 15 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power sheffield leeds liverpool and manchester combined in doing so we are making a vital contribution to the uks ambitious targets for decarbonisation across electricity generation heating and transport  an 80 reduction by 2050 vs 1990 levels we benefited from the first year of operation of our third biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd scheme which provides an indexlinked price for the power produced until march 2027 the unit underwent a major planned outage between september and november with a full programme of works successfully completed the flexibility reliability and scale of our renewable generation alongside an attractive total system cost means we are strongly placed to play a longterm role in the uks energy mix to that end we continue to see longterm biomass generation as a key enabler allowing the uk government to meet its decarbonisation targets and the system operator to manage the grid the uk government recently confirmed support for further biomass generation at drax power station and we now plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  allowing us to provide even more renewable electricity whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer our heritage is coal but our future is flexible lowercarbon electricity we are making progress with the development of four new standalone ocgt plants situated in eastern england and wales and our work to develop options for coaltogas repowering with battery technologies  if these options would be supported by 15year capacity market contracts providing a clear investment signal and extending visibility of contractbased earnings out to the late 2030s in b2b energy supply we completed the acquisition of opus energy a supplier of electricity and gas to corporates and small businesses the transaction completed in february 2017 and opus energy has continued to operate successfully within the group achieving its targets and making an immediate and significant contribution to profitability alongside this good performance we have also implemented the operational steps necessary to realise further operational benefits of the acquisition and we now source all of opus power and gas internally haven power delivered a strong performance with the sale of large volumes of electricity to industrial customers through our customer focus and efficiencies margins have improved and the business generated a positive ebitda for the first time together our b2b energy supply business now has over 375000 customer meters making it the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk we are delivering innovative lowcarbon power solutions with 46 of our energy sold from renewable sources as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power we see this as a significant opportunity for the group in the medium to long term in october 2017 we completed the sale of billington bioenergy bbe to aggregated micro power holding amph consideration for the transaction was 23 million comprised of 16 million of shares in amph and 07 million of cash the sale of bbe is aligned with our strategy to focus on b2b energy supply however through our shareholding in amph we will retain an interest in the uk heating market whilst gaining exposure to the development of smallscale distributed energy assets political regulatory and economic background we continue to operate in a changing environment the full impact of the uks decision to leave the eu is still unknown the immediate impact on the group was a weakening of sterling and an associated increase in the cost of biomass which is generally denominated in other currencies through our utilisation of mediumterm foreign exchange hedges the group protected the cash impact of this weakness in 2017 sterling has generally strengthened and we have been able to extend our hedged position out to 2022 at rates close to those that we saw before brexit in terms of uk energy policy the governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts svt are not a common feature of the b2b market at the microbusiness end of this market which is closer in size to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are active in renewing contracts the uk governments response to its consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 has confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by october 2025 we believe our assets projects and ability to support our customers electricity management will support the governments ambition to maintain reliability when coal generation ceases running a resilient reliable grid is not simply about meeting the power demand on the system there are also system support services which are essential to its effective operation as the grid decentralises and becomes dependent on smaller distributed generation the number of plants able to provide these services is reducing biomass generation our proposed ocgts and our repowering project would allow us to meet these needs but this will not come for free a reliable flexible lowcarbon energy system will require the right longterm incentives in november 2017 the government confirmed that the uk will maintain a total carbon price the combined uk carbon price support  cps  and the european union emissions trading scheme  eu ets at around the current level cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing the level of carbon emissions in generation and we continue to support the pricing of carbon a view echoed in a report prepared for the uk government by the leading academic professor dieter helm against this backdrop we continue to make an important contribution to the uk economy according to a study published by oxford economics in 2016  draxs total economic impact  including our supply chain and the wages our employees and suppliers employees spend in the wider consumereconomy was 17 billion supporting 18500 jobs across the uk safety sustainability and people the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is vital to the group with safety at the centre of our operational philosophy we also recognise the growing need to support the wellbeing of our employees and their mental health during the year we continued to use total recordable injury rate trir as our primary kpi in this area performance was positive at 027 but we expect this to improve in the coming year the incident at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did not lead to physical injuries but was nonetheless a significant event and caused disruption into 2018 we consequently launched an incident investigation to ensure our personal and process safety management procedures are robust to promote greater awareness around wellbeing we have embedded this in our new people strategy and expect to focus more energy and resources on this important area during 2018 strong corporate governance is at the heart of the group  acting responsibly doing the right thing and being transparent as the group grows the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and recognising the importance of strong corporate governance  we have published a comprehensive overview of our sustainability progress in 2017 on our website  this also highlights future priorities to broaden our approach to sustainability and improved reporting of environment  social and governance esg performance we have also completed the process which allows us to participate in the un global compact ungc  an international framework which will guide our approach in the areas of human rights labour environment and anticorruption during 2017 we published our first statement on the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in compliance with the uk modern slavery act we have added modern slavery awareness to our programme of regular training for contract managers and reviewed our counterparty due diligence processes we have continued to maintain our rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability

actively manage and reinvest in their forests  operational review safety remains our primary concern and we have delivered yearonyear reduction in the level of recordable incidents output at our amite and morehouse pellet plants increased significantly although was below our target for the year we have remained focused on opportunities to improve efficiencies and capture cost savings as part of our drive to produce good quality pellets at the lowest possible cost we still have more work to do in this area to optimise quality and cost as our performance was below target for the year as part of our plans to optimise and improve operations we added 150k tonnes capacity at our existing plants bringing total installed capacity to 11 million tonnes and increasing the amount of lower cost sawmill residues we are able to process and used in our pellets  case study lowcost highimpact capacity increase byproducts of higher value wood industries such as sawdust from sawmills offer a lowcost source of residues for use in our pellet production process and during 2017 we added an additional 150k tonnes of capacity at our pellet plants to allow us to use more of this material by investing in giant hydraulic platforms known as truck dumps operators at amite and morehouse can unload a 50foot truck carrying either sawdust or wood chips and weighing 60 tonnes in less than two minutes increasing

this reinforces the drax proposition  flexible reliable lowcarbon electricity in november the government updated its intentions regarding the future trajectory of uk carbon price support cps indicating that the total cost of carbon tax in the uk the total of cps and the eu emissions trading scheme would continue at around the current level  the tax is currently set at 18tonne  whilst coal remains on the system we believe that cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing carbon emissions from generation and that having an appropriate price for carbon emissions is the right way to provide a market signal to further reduce emissions in support of the uks longterm decarbonisation targets the uk government has now confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by 2025 we support this move subject to an appropriate alternative technology being in place with this in mind we have continued to develop options for our remaining coal assets to convert to biomass or

earnings visibility for the group the safe and efficient completion of these complex works is a credit to those involved and reflects our continued focus on opportunities for improvement and efficiencies the entire organisation has responded to a number of challenging unplanned events most notably in december we experienced a fire on a section of conveyor at our biomass rail unloading facility and consequently an unplanned outage from late december 2017 to midjanuary 2018 following investigation and recommissioning the facility has returned to service with enhanced operating procedures although this issue did not relate to the operation of the biomassgenerating units the resulting restriction on fuel deliveries by rail required the optimisation of generation across our biomass units resulting in lower ebitda and full year biomass availability than our target for the year financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 238 million 2016 174 million principally due to the cfd mechanism value from flexibility was below our target for the year principally reflecting a lower level of ancillary service payments versus 2016 our operational performance drives the results the financial impact of the unplanned outage on the rail unloading facility was mitigated by optimisation of our available biomass and the use of additional generation capacity retained for selfinsurance purposes however this incident is a reminder of the need to invest appropriately to maintain a high level of operational availability and flexibility at

control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme which will enable drax to convert a fourth unit to biomass the response proposes that rather than imposing a cap on roc 1 support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all roc 1 units this would protect existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the

refurbishing a 300tonne generator core within the heart of a power station 6 december 2017 power generation at the centre of drax power station in a corner of the cavernous turbine hall is a white box the inside of this box is spotlessly clean not only are its white walls free of dirt they are free of even dust but there is one outlier inside this sterile environment a 300tonne chunk of industrial equipment this equipment is a generator core  the central component for converting the mechanical energy to electrical power the core is driven by the steam turbine ninety tonnes of generator rotor spinning at 3000 rpm with just millimetres of clearance from the core produce 660 megawatts mw of electricity thats enough  645 mw when exported from drax into the national grid  to power a city the size of sheffield the generator is a serious piece of industrial machinery and despite the pristine conditions this white box is the site of serious engineering a process normally done by largescale manufacturers in dedicated factories rewinding a generator core  as the process is called  is a major operation no other uk facility is capable of doing this complex job so its here in a white box in the middle of an operational power station in north yorkshire that a team of engineers is undertaking work that will secure the generators use for decades this is the drax rewinding facility how a generator works a generator consists of two main components a spinning rotor and a stationary stator the rotor which is directly connected to the main turbine and spins 50 times every second sits inside the stator both the stator and the rotor contain a large number of copper coils known as windings these windings are what carry the electrical current the rotor acts like a very strong electromagnet which when a voltage is applied produces a strong magnetic field because the rotor sits inside the stator this magnetic field intersects the copper windings of the stator and induces a voltage in these windings allowing current to flow this voltage is then brought out of the stator and passed through a stepup transformer where it is increased to a level suitable for transmission through the national grid the stator core is made from many elements with hundreds of thousands of laminations 84 watercooled insulated copper bars each 11 metres long and weighing 200kg forming the windings various insulating materials blocks packing wedges and condition monitoring equipment generator stators can operate for decades without fault diy at drax in 2016 a team of engineers at drax embarked on a project to construct a facility to rewind the stator on site this required crosscompany collaborative working to design and construct this huge purpose built facility contamination can cause operational problems so the team built a sterile white room within the turbine hall  one of just two places within the power station with foundations strong enough to support the incredible 450 tonnes required for the rewind facility designed to hold the stator core and the conductor bars air is forced out of the room to limit the possibility of contamination to the core during the rewind when the unit is in service it becomes magnetic so any metallic particles left in the space will be attracted to the core explains drax electrical engineer thomas walker once magnetised any metal particles could be drawn in burrowing into the insulation and core lamination this is the kind of event that an electricity generator wants to avoid  but when it happens be prepared to fix it roll with it when draxs stators were manufactured in the 1980s completing their construction relied on manual handling techniques modern day facilities however rotate the core to minimise human contact it took just six months for a partnership involving drax siemens and enser to manufacture what could be the largest stator rollers in the world and within that time ship them from the us to north yorkshire with the rollers installed the next step was to move in the core two of the turbine halls cranes each capable of lifting 150 tonnes were combined to lift it hoisting the core onto the mechanical roller within the rewind facility once in place the roller rotates the core allowing for the copper conductor bars to be safely removed and inserted despite this mechanical help the removing and replacing of each one is still at its heart a human job we still need 10 men to physically move the conductor bars with lifting aids which makes it not an easy process says walker using this method the bars weighing 200kg each can be safely and precisely fitted into the core opting for inhouse rewinding a stator is a complex process however when the time logistics and costs of shipping the core to siemens  the germanbased manufacturers  was factored in the decision to do the work at drax power station was an easy one  a 300tonne core is not easy to transport and the highways agency do not like things like that on the roads theyd want us to use waterways says drax lead engineer mark rowbottom logistically it just wasnt worth it its too much money to move and ship that weight to germany so we looked at what we could do onsite more than just an economical and logistical decision and with the uks diminishing manufacturing facilities drax is now equipped to support generator rewinds for many years to come building and operating the rewind facility was a project that leveraged the engineering abilities of drax employees they are increasingly doing engineering traditionally outsourced to equipment manufacturers the experience we have gained and the close working relationship we have established with siemens enables us to support the generator for the remaining life of the station says rowbottom to see the core in that many pieces and stripped down to this level is very rare says walker who began working at the plant as an apprentice  of the 84 conductor bars half have been fitted and the team is scheduled to complete the stator rewind in early 2018 i never thought id do anything like this but am proud to say that ive done it tags technology  engineering  drax power station  investors 7 things to see at drax power station 4 october 2017 power generation chimneys taller than the london eye domes bigger than the albert hall and enough steel tubing to run the length of the uk twice drax power station is a structure of superlatives but its visiting the site that truly drives home the scale of the electricity generating process from tiny biomass pellets to landscapeshaping cooling towers here are seven of the mostimpressive and interesting parts of drax power station cooling towers arguably the power stations most recognisable landmarks draxs 12 giant cooling towers each measure 114 metres tall to put that in perspective each is large enough to fit the entire statue of liberty inside it  with room to spare these massive concrete structures cool the water used as part of the generation process water is pumped into the tower at roughly 40 degrees celsius and is cooled by air naturally pulled into the structure by its unique shape once the water is cooled it is safely returned to the river ouse so whats coming out the top of a cooling tower water vapour and it only accounts for roughly 2 of all the water pumped into the tower biomass domes standing 65 metres tall draxs four biomass domes are each larger than the royal albert hall and between them hold approximately 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days each dome was constructed by inflating a massive pvc dome  coating its inside with a layer of polyurethane foam and then adding steel and concrete reinforcements because of the sensitive nature of compressed wood pellets the environment inside each dome must be very carefully monitored one of the measures to keep the biomass inert is to feed in nitrogen extracted from the air into the dome  rail unloading bay coals days traversing the uk by train are almost numbered  biomass is taking over its routes compressed wood pellets arrive to english shores at the ports of liverpool  hull and immingham and are then transported across the country in specially designed trains roughly 14 arrive every day collectively unloading about 20000 tonnes of pellets draxs bespoke wagons ensure the wood pellets are kept dry during transportation and unloaded as efficiently as possible this includes a hatch on the bottom of the wagons that is opened magnetically to drop the pellets down into the collection area as they arrive turbine hall heres where the magic happens  its in the turbine hall that electricity is generated biomass is fast replacing coal to be combusted to produce steam which is used to spin massive electromagnets at 3000 rpm inside copper windings which in turn generates electricity with each of the six turbines capable of exporting over 600 megawatts mw into the national grid  the total capacity of drax power station sits just shy of 4000 mw 70 of which now comes

generation batteries as big as biomass domes 24 may 2017 sustainable bioenergy renewables are playing a bigger part of our electricity mix as the uk moves towards a low carbon economy how we plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables is among the greatest challenges faced by the energy sector sources like wind and solar are intermittent  they cant generate electricity all the time when the sun doesnt shine or the wind doesnt blow they lack the fuel needed to generate power and cant feed into the grid this leaves a gap in the uks electricity supply that needs to be filled today thats done by sources like coal gas and biomass which can be dialled up and down to accommodate for the dips and peaks in generation created by changes in demand and the weather one alternative being touted as a possible solution is storage and in particular battery technology however creating batteries on a scale big enough to meet our incredible demand is a considerable challenge its a challenge that will be met in a future where giant affordable batteries are able to store solar power captured in the summer months for use in the winter but costs would have to come down at an even faster rate than they have done in recent years the challenge of building bigger batteries to demonstrate the size of this challenge consider the biomass storage domes at drax power station these effectively operate as giant energy stores with the flexible ability to quickly feed renewable fuel to the power station which generates electricity on demand our biomass domes can hold 300000 tonnes of sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets  the equivalent of 600 gwh worth of electricity currently batteries cost 350 per kwh meaning at present prices it would cost 210 billion to replace the capacity of all four of our biomass domes using battery power even if battery technology advances dramatically over the next few years that figure is only likely to fall to around 60 billion then there is the question of the ancillary services that thermal power stations provide the batteries of the future may be able to provide these vital services such as synthetic inertia shortterm reserve and reactive power but for now providing these via battery power is prohibitively expensive and in some cases best left to biomass and gas power stations we should not underestimate the challenges ahead the uks everchanging power system will need to balance more electricity generated via wind and solar with affordable solutions that are also reliable flexible and lower carbon than coal  this is why drax is developing
