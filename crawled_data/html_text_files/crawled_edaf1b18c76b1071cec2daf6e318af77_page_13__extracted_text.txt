decarbonisation decarbonisation the next step andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 19 december 2016 opinion half a decade ago we began a major transformation at drax power station converting it to run on sustainable biomass this week weve reached another milestone in that journey weve been granted a contract for difference cfd  a uk government financial support thats now been approved by the european commission it allows us to fully convert a third power generation unit to run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of renewable biomass the granting of the cfd is a symbolic moment in our decarbonisation journey  it marks the close of one phase of development where the power station now makes more renewable than fossil fuel power and the start of the next this next chapter began when we announced two major projects the acquisition of opus energy and our plans to build four new rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt power stations  like the upgrade of drax power station these new peaking plants are an important step in helping the country achieve a decarbonised energy system they will do this by enabling more renewables to come onto the system the need for a diverse power network nearly 45 of the uks power already comes from gas mostly generated by combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants but while ccgt plants can deliver a steady supply of baseload power and flex up and down within seconds  just like drax power station does with both coal and biomass  they cant turn on and be at full capacity at very short notice starting from cold to quickly power the equivalent of a small city in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days however is exactly what the uk power network is increasingly going to need solar and wind power cant generate electricity when its dark or still so to facilitate more of these intermittent renewables coming onto the grid we need sources that can be quickly ramped up to fill the gaps when lower carbon technologies arent able to provide the essential power for the modern world this is where ocgt stations come in alongside other standby technologies such as storage and demand side response ocgt stations have turbines that work like jet engines this means they can start up incredibly quickly getting to full load in just 30 minutes meeting surges quickly when intermittent renewables cant and nuclear biomass and ccgt power stations are already providing baseload electricity our proposed plants could be online as soon as the winter of 202021  a few years before the last remaining coalfired power stations close down they will operate for roughly 500 hours a year with a maximum availability of 1500 hours depending on demand and each will have a capacity of 299 mw each will generate enough instant power to simultaneously boil 120000 kettles  as well as allowing more renewables onto the system these gas plants support the governments vision for reducing the carbon intensity of our energy grid  gas has half the carbon footprint of coal  more than that we have expertise in it drax ceo dorothy thompson  has developed and operated 3160 mw of gas assets in the past for intergen while a number of our engineers have worked across development construction and operation of gas projects we trade in it too so we know the market well in short a move into gas is one we are well suited too a secure economic future thanks to capacity market contracts our ocgt plants will have limited reliance on income from the energy markets in the future the capacity market is a government scheme designed to boost the uks energy security it does this by paying new and existing power plants a fixed price to be available to generate electricity in future winters the time of the year when demand is at its highest the price they are paid is determined by a competitive auction which allows government to secure as much capacity as it needs at the lowest price possible building new power stations requires substantial investment so having fixedprice contracts for power allows generators  like us  and their shareholders to invest in low carbon projects  safe in the knowledge that it will be economical to do so were aiming to secure 15year capacity contracts for one ocgt in england and one in wales within the next two years in the most recent capacity auction  the price was driven too low to justify a commitment to build the first two plants this doesnt mean development on the plants will stop critical development work will continue throughout 2017 and next december the plants will be reentered into the competition continued commitment to biomass our new power stations mark a new chapter for drax group but what they dont affect is our commitment to biomass drax power station is already generating a majority of its electricity using high density wood pellets  and the granting of the cfd means we can now finalise the coaltobiomass upgrade of half of the uks biggest power station and continue to invest in these assets with the right support we stand ready to complete the conversion of our north yorkshire site and run entirely on sustainablysourced biomass a study from engineering and design company arup found that after onshore wind converted biomass power plants are the most affordable largescale renewable power solution in the uk more than that the costs of undertaking this conversion have come down over the last few years however there is still room to bring this cost down further and we believe this needs to happen before we can fully convert drax power station we are as determined to achieve this as we have ever been our view has always been to ensure we provide power for a brighter future and our new power stations are the next step in doing this tags energy policy  gas  decarbonisation renewables better together andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 5 april 2016 opinion theres more pressure than ever to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation and no one is keener than the team here at drax power station to make it happen in fact weve been doing it for a decade but we need the right support to finish the job we upgraded our turbines between 200712 to save one million tonnes of co2 emissions weve converted half our station to run on compressed wood pellets instead of coal  reducing emissions by up to 86 per cent  our friends in the north of england have invested millions of pounds to help us make that happen through building new infrastructure at our landing and loading facilities at the port of tyne  the new port at liverpool  at hull and at immingham  weve designed and commissioned our own rolling stock with lloyds register rail to ensure that the compressed wood pellets can be transported to the power station in the most energyefficient way possible and while many jobs in the north of england are being lost with the planned closure of a number of older coalfired power stations we continue to employ over a thousand people directly here in north yorkshire in fact its no exaggeration to say that drax is a genuine northern powerhouse to borrow a phrase from the chancellor of the exchequer which is why we hope he and his colleagues in government will listen when we say that were seriously concerned that the planned auctions for new green energy could result in bill payers missing out on savings of over 2 billion the government has committed to three further renewable energy auctions that will happen over the next few years the first of them is already planned for later in 2016 as far as we know those auctions will only be open to offshore wind and perhaps also something being referred to as less established technologies but independent research published by nera and imperial college london suggests that a single technology approach could waste a significant amount of money the research was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main renewable energy technologies  wind solar and biomass as a result economists conclude that hard working families and businesses could enjoy significant savings if these auctions were opened up to include other renewables but the sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow this makes wind and solar intermittent energy technologies backup power is needed when the weathers not right or when demand is high naturally this standby energy isnt free someone has to pay for it but those additional costs are not currently included in the way that the government calculates how much support the different kinds of renewable energy require and the iclnera research shows that when the true costs are added in offshore wind is actually the most expensive form of renewable energy the affordable solution is to convert existing power stations to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal  this balanced approach also allows more offshore wind and solar onto our electricity network without the need for more fossil fuels to provide overall reliability more biomass conversions can also help the uk end coal by energy secretary amber rudds 2025 target date  thats what we mean when we say drax needs the right support to finish the job were asking the government to consider the true cost of bringing new renewable capacity on stream and then to add sustainable biomass to the auctions for new contracts that decision could save bill payers up to 2bn  it could safeguard thousands of direct and indirect jobs in yorkshire and the north of england and it will give our country the reliable renewable power we need when others just cant deliver it tags biomass energy  ships and shipping  transport  decarbonisation  1  8 9 10 11 12 13 name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our
