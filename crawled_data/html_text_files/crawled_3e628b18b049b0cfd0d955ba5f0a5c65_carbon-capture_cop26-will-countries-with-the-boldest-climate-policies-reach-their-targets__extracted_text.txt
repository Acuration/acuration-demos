power station cop26 will countries with the boldest climate policies reach their targets which countries are on track to achieve their climate goals in the first global stocktake since the paris agreement 30 october 2020 carbon capture to tackle the climate crisis global unity and collaboration are needed this was in part the thinking behind the paris agreement it set a clear collective target negotiated at the 2015 united nations climate change conference and signed the following year to keep the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in november 2021 cop26 will see many of the countries who first signed the paris agreement come together in glasgow for the first global stocktake of their environmental progress since its creation cop26 will take place at the sec in glasgow already delayed for a year as a result of the pandemic covid19 and its effects on emissions is likely to be a key talking point so too will progress towards not just the paris agreement goals but those of individual countries known as national determined contributions ndcs these sit under the umbrella of the paris agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries with many countries still reeling from the effects of covid19 the question is which countries are actually on track to meet them what are the goals the ndcs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change these incorporate various targets from decarbonisation and forestry to coastal preservation and financial aims while all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the paris agreement targets not all have an equally sized task the principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions capabilities and economic conditions the universal ecological fund outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters showing that combined they account for 56 of global greenhouse gas emissions china is the largest emitter responsible for 268 followed by the us which contributes 131 the european union and its 28 member states account for nine per cent while india is responsible for seven per cent of all emissions these nations have ambitious emissions goals but are they on track to meet them china traffic jams in the rush hour in shanghai downtown contribute to high emissions in china by 2030 china pledged to reach peak carbon dioxide co 2   increase its nonfossil fuel share of energy supply to 20 and reduce the carbon intensity  the ratio between emissions of co 2 to the output of the economy  by 60 to 65 below 2005 levels covid19 has increased the uncertainty of the course of chinas emissions some projections show that emissions are likely to grow in the short term before peaking and levelling out sometime between 2021 and 2025 however according to the climate action tracker it is also possible that chinas emissions have already peaked  specifically in 2019 china is expected to meet its nonfossil energy supply and carbon intensity pledges united states the forecast for the second largest emitter the us has also been affected by the pandemic economic firm rhodium group has predicted that the us could see its emissions drop between 20 and 27 by 2025 meeting its target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels however president trumps rolling back of obamaera climate policies and regulations his support of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the paris agreement effective from as early as 4 november 2020 suggest any achievement may not be longlasting the united states coronavirus aid relief and economic security act known as the cares act does not include any direct support to clean energy development  something that could also change in 2021 european union carl clayton head of beccs at drax inspects pipework in the ccus area of drax power station the european union and its member states then including the uk pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40 below 1990 levels by 2030  a target the climate action tracker estimates will be achieved in fact the eu is on track to cut emissions by 58 by 2030 this progress is in part a result of a large package of measures adopted in 2018 these accelerated the emissions reductions including national coal phaseout plans increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency the package also introduced legally binding annual emission limits for each member state within which they can set individual targets to meet the common goal the uk has not yet released an updated independent ndc however it has announced a 350 million package designed to cut emissions in heavy industry and drive economic recovery from covid19 this includes 139 million earmarked to scale up hydrogen production as well as carbon capture and storage ccs technology such as bioenergy with carbon capture beccs  essential technologies in achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and protecting industrial regions  india india the fourth largest global emitter is set to meet its pledge to reduce its emissions intensity by 33 to 35 below 2005 levels and increase the nonfossil share of power generation to 40 by 2030 whats more the central electricity agency has reported that 64 of indias power could come from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030 wind turbines in jaisalmer rajasthan india along with increasingly renewable generation the implementation of indias national smart grid mission aims to modernise and improve the efficiency of the countrys energy system it is promising that the worlds four largest emitters have plans in place and are making progress towards their decarbonisation goals however tackling climate change requires action from around the entire globe in addition to ndcs many countries have committed to or have submitted statements of intent to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the coming years
