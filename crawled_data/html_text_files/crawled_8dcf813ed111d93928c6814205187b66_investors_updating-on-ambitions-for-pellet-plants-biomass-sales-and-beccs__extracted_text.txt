production and biomass sales biomass pellet production  targeting 8mt pa by 2030 currently c4mt biomass pellet sales to third parties  targeting 4mt pa by 2030 currently c2mt continued progress with uk beccs 1 and biomass cost reduction beccs at drax power station  targeting 8mt pa of negative co 2 emissions by 2030 biomass cost reduction  continuing to target biomass production cost of 100t 2 3bn of investment in opportunities for growth 2022 to 2030 pellet production uk beccs and pumped storage selffunded and significantly below 2x net debt to adjusted ebitda 3 in 2030 development of additional investment opportunities for newbuild beccs targeting 4mt pa of negative co 2 emissions outside of uk by 2030 targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital will gardiner drax group ceo said will gardiner ceo drax group click to viewdownload drax has made excellent progress during 2021 providing a firm foundation for further growth we have advanced our beccs project  a vital part of the east coast cluster that was recently selected to be one of the uks two priority ccs projects and were now setting out a strategy to take the business forward enabling drax to make an even greater contribution to global efforts to reach net zero we believe drax can deliver growth and become a global leader in sustainable biomass and negative emissions and a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation we aim to double our sustainable biomass production capacity by 2030  creating opportunities to double our sales to asia and europe where demand for biomass is increasing as countries transition away from coal as a global leader in negative emissions were going to scale up our ambitions internationally drax is now targeting 12 million tonnes of carbon removals each year by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this includes the negative emissions we can deliver at drax power station in the uk and through potential newbuild beccs projects in north america and europe supporting a new sector of the economy which will create jobs clean growth and exciting export opportunities capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the groups strategy market opportunities and development projects the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees to grow its biomass supply chain biomass sales and beccs as well as longterm dispatchable generation from biomass and pumped storage purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies which increasingly recognise the unique role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change strategic pillars to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets to be a global leader in negative emissions to be a leader in uk dispatchable renewable generation the development of these pillars remains underpinned by the groups continued focus on safety sustainability and biomass cost reduction a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets drax believes that the global market for sustainable biomass will grow significantly creating opportunities for sales to third parties in asia and europe beccs generation and other longterm uses of biomass delivery of these opportunities is supported by the expansion of the groups biomass pellet production capacity the group has 13 operational pellet plants with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further two plants currently commissioning and other developmentsexpansions which will increase this to c5mt once complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity to deliver this additional capacity drax is developing a pipeline of organic projects principally focused on north america drax expects to take a final investment decision on 051mt of new capacity in 2022 targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital underpinned by this expanded production capacity drax aims to double sales of biomass to third parties to 4mt pa by 2030 developing its market presence in asia and europe facilitated by the creation of new business development teams in tokyo and london drax is a major producer supplier and user of biomass active in all areas of the supply chain with longterm relationships and almost 20 years of experience in biomass operations the groups innovation in coaltobiomass engineering supply chain management and leadership in negative emissions can be deployed alongside its large reliable and sustainable supply chain to support customer decarbonisation journeys with longterm partnerships drax expects to sell all the biomass it produces based on an appropriate market price typically with longterm indexlinked contracts continued focus on cost reduction in 2018 the groups biomass production cost was 166t 2  at the h1 2021 results through a combination of fibre sourcing operational improvements and capacity expansion including the acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc the production cost had reduced to 141t 2  draxs aims to use the combined expertise of drax and pinnacle to apply learnings and cost savings across its portfolio and continues to target 100t 2 50mwh equivalent 4  by 2027 a global leader in negative emissions the intergovernmental panel on climate change 5 and the coalition for negative emissions 6 have both outlined a clear role for beccs in delivering the negative emissions required to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels and to achieve net zero by 2050 identifying a requirement of between 2bn and 7bn tonnes of negative emissions globally from beccs separately the uk government has recently published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support beccs to meet these requirements subject to the right regulatory environment drax plans to transform drax power station into the worlds biggest carbon capture project using beccs to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 emissions from the atmosphere each year by 2030 the project is well developed the technology is proven and an investment decision could be taken in 2024 with the first beccs unit operational in 2027 and a second in 2030 subject to the right investment framework the group aims to build on this innovation with a new target to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions pa from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation the uks plans to achieve net zero by 2050 will require the electrification of heating and transport systems resulting in a significant increase in demand for electricity drax believes that over 80 of this could be met by intermittent renewable and inflexible lowcarbon energy sources  wind solar and nuclear however this will only be possible if the remaining power sources can provide the dispatchable power and nongeneration system support services the power system requires to ensure security of supply and to limit the cost to the consumer longterm biomass generation and pumped storage hydro can provide these increasingly important services drax power station is the uks largest source of renewable power by output and the largest dispatchable plant the group is continuing to develop a lower cost operating model for this asset supported by a reduction in fixed costs associated with the end of coal operations drax is also developing an option for new pumped storage  cruachan ii  which could take a final investment decision in 2024 and be operational by 2030 providing an additional 600mw of dispatchable longduration storage to the power system in its smart systems and flexibility plan july 2021 the uk government described longduration storage technologies as essential for achieving net zero and has committed to take actions to derisk investment for largescale and longduration storage capital allocation and dividend strategic capital investment 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity beccs at drax power station and cruachan ii is expected to be in the region of 3bn between 2022 and 2030 backed by longterm contracted cashflows and targeting high singledigit returns and above no final investment decision has been taken on any of these projects and both beccs and cruachan ii remain subject to further clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms the group believes these investments can be selffunded through strong cash generation over the period with net debt to adjusted ebitda significantly below 2x at the end of 2030 providing flexibility to support further investment such as newbuild beccs as these options develop drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 noting that average annual dividend growth was around 10 in the last 5years webcast and presentation material the event will be webcast from 1000am and the material made available
