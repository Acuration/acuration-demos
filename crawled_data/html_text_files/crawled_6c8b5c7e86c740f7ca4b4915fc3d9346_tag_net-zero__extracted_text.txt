net zero why the humber represents britains biggest decarbonisation opportunity 5 september 2022 carbon capture richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax key takeaways the humber industrial cluster contributes 18 billion a year to the uk economy and supports 360000 jobs in heavy industry and manufacturing as demand for industrial products with green credentials rises and net zero targets demand decarbonisation businesses in the humber need to begin implementing carbon capture at scale the size of the humber and diversity of industries make it a significant challenge but if we get it right the humber will be a world leader in decarbonisation without investment in decarbonisation infrastructure the region risks losing its status as a world leading industrial cluster putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk when the iconic humber bridge opened in june 1981 it did more than just set records for its size it connected the region uniting both communities and industries and allowing the humber to become what it is today a thriving industrial hub that contributes more than 18 billion to the uk economy and supports some 360000 jobs as the uk works towards a lowcarbon future the shift to a green economy will require new regional infrastructure that once again unites the humbers people and businesses around a shared goal while the humber bridge connected the region across the estuary waters a new subterranean pipeline that can transport the carbon captured from industries will unify the regions decarbonisation efforts its infrastructure that will be crucial in helping the uk reach its net zero goals but also cement the humbers position as a global decarbonisation leader the humber bridge capturing carbon across the humber capturing carbon  preventing emissions from entering the atmosphere and storing them safely and permanently is a fundamental part of decarbonising the economy and tackling climate change aside from the chemical engineering required to extract carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial emissions one of the key challenges of carbon capture is how you transport it at scale to secure storage locations such as below the north sea bed where the carbon can be permanently trapped and sequestered  click to viewdownload engineers at drax power station at drax were pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology but carbon capture will play an important role in decarbonising a wide range of industries the humber region not only produces about 20 of the uks electricity its also a major hub for chemicals refining steel making and other carbonintensive industries the consequence of this industrial mix is that the humbers carbon footprint per head of population is bigger than anywhere else in the country at an international level its the second largest industrial cluster by co 2 emissions in the whole of western europe if the uk is to reach net zero the humber must decarbonise and carbon capture and storage will be instrumental in achieving that the scale of the challenge in the humber also makes it an opportunity to significantly reduce the countrys overall emissions and break new ground implementing carbon capture innovations across a wide range of industries these diverse businesses can be united in their collective efforts and connected through shared decarbonisation infrastructure  equipment to capture emissions pipelines to transport them and a shared site to store them safely and permanently economies of scale through shared infrastructure the idea of a co 2 transport pipeline traversing the humber might sound unusual but largescale natural gas pipelines have crisscrossed the region since the late 1960s when gas was dispatched from the easington terminal on the east yorkshire coast under the humber to killingholme in north lincolnshire further the uks existing legislation creates an environment to ensure they can be operated safely and effectively co 2 is a very stable molecule compared to natural gas and there are already thousands of miles of co 2 pipelines operating around the us where its historically been used in oil recovery a shared pipeline also offers economies of scale for companies to implement carbon capture allowing the humbers cluster of carbonintensive industries to invest in vital infrastructure in a costeffective way the diversity of different industries in the region from renewable baseload power generation at drax to cuttingedge hydrogen production  also offers a chance to experiment and showcase whats possible at scale the humbers position as an estuary onto the north sea is also advantageous its expansive layers of porous sandstone offer an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space the humber estuary but this isnt just an opportunity to decarbonise the uks most emissionsintensive region its a stage to present a new green industrial hub to the world a hub that could create as many as 47800 jobs including high quality technical and construction roles as well as other jobs throughout supply chains and the wider uk economy british innovation as a global export as industries of all kinds across the world race to decarbonise theres an increasing demand for products with green credentials if we can decarbonise products from the region such as steel  it will give uk businesses a global edge failure to follow through on environmental ambitions however will not just damage the clusters status it will put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk breaking new ground is difficult but there are firstmover advantages the products and processes trialled and run at scale within the humber offer intellectual property that industrial hubs around the world are searching for creating a new export for the uk but this vision of a decarbonised humber that exports both its products and knowledge to the world is only possible if we take the right action now we have a genuine global leadership position if we dont act now that will be lost through projects like zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster  alongside net zero teesside the regions businesses have shown our collective commitment to implementing decarbonisation at scale through collaboration as a track 1 cluster  the humber presents one of the uks greatest opportunities to level up  attracting global businesses and investors as well as protecting and creating skilled jobs we need to seize this moment and put in place the infrastructure that will put the humber at the forefront of a lowcarbon
