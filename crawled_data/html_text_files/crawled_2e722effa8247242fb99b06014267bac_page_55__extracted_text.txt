may not have been a white christmas  but it certainly was a green one more than 40 of the electricity generated on christmas day came from renewable sources  making it the greenest christmas ever for energy generation on average 124gw of electricity generated came from green sources  63 more than in 2015 when just 25 of the electricity generated came from renewables and up 195 compared to five christmases ago in 2012 when just 42gw or 12 of the energy generated came from renewables 75 of the renewable energy produced on christmas day came from wind turbines with 94gw generated on average  equivalent to 31 of all the electricity generated that day this was close to the record for wind generation reached just a couple of days earlier on friday december 23 2016 when at its peak 108gw of power was generated by wind the figures from electric insights commissioned by drax show that biomass generation has also increased from just 05gw on average on december 25 2012 to 2gw at christmas in 2016 this comes just days after the european commission approved the uk governments decision to award drax power a contract for difference cfd to upgrade the third of its six units at its power station in north yorkshire to run on wood pellets from coal andy koss drax power ceo said these christmas figures show that the uk energy system really is changing renewables are increasingly vital to the uks energy mix as we decarbonise and move away from coal since upgrading half of the power station to run on wood pellets three million households are powered with renewable energy generated by drax we provided 20 of the uks renewable power in the first half of 2016 biomass allows for more continuous power generation than other intermittent renewables which is important for security of supply with the right conditions we can do even more converting further units at drax to use sustainable biomass in place of coal and through rapid response gas projects to plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables drax is developing plans to build four stateof theart rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt power stations which could at the flick of a switch be running at capacity within ten minutes these more flexible plants will provide system support to the grid and plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables like solar and wind the proposed rapid response gas projects would further assist in getting coal off the system and so help the government achieve carbon saving targets andy koss commented its important to have the right mix of energy generation to ensure we are decarbonising whilst also keeping the lights on and the costs down this is the next step for us in helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future ends contact ali lewis head of media relations 01757 612165 email protected notes to editors table comparing the average electricity generation from renewables on christmas day for the last five christmases christmas day average renewable generation  of electricity generated by renewables 2016 124gw 413 2015 76gw 2525 2014 55gw 1703 2013 59gw 1766 2012 42gw 125 these figures include the electricity generated from wind solar hydro and biomass the findings come from electric insights  a realtime dashboard of great britains electricity demand supply price and environmental impact quarterly electric insights reports are produced independently by researchers from imperial college london commissioned by drax they look at britains publicly available electricity data and aims to inform the debate on the electricity system the government has set out proposals to end coalfired generation by 2025 as part of its plan to stimulate more clean energy generation the european commissions decision gives approval to the uk governments support for the upgrade of drax power station from coal to biomass and marks the culmination of a 650 million investment drax power station is the largest carbon saving project in europe saving 12 million tonnes of carbon each year total emissions are calculated from british electricity consumption in tonnes per hour including emissions from imported power and the carbon intensity of electricity  total emissions divided by total demand in grams per kilowatt hour gkwh about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future drax operates the largest power station in the uk and supplies up to 8 percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal into becoming a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator in addition to being one of the largest producers of renewable powers in the uk drax also holds the distinction of being europes single largest decarbonisation project its 1400strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group employs around 1400 people and also includes drax biomass  based in the us and manufacturers compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests haven power  the groups retail arm providing business electricity contracts that are simple flexible and designed to customers specific requirements billington bioenergy  is one of the leading distributors of wood pellets for sustainable heating in the uk for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk drax power chief executive why britain needs rapidresponse gas 19 december 2016 press releases nearly 45 of the uks power already comes from gas mostly generated by combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plantsbut while ccgt plants can deliver a steady supply of baseload power and flex up and down within seconds  just like drax power station does with both coal and biomass  they cant turn on and be at full capacity at very short notice starting from cold to quickly power the equivalent of a small city in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days however is exactly what the uk power network is increasingly going to need solar and wind power cant generate electricity when its dark or still so to facilitate more of these intermittent renewables coming onto the grid we need sources that can be quickly ramped up to fill the gaps when lower carbon technologies arent able to provide the essential power for the modern world this is where ocgt open cycle gas turbine stations such as millbrook power in bedfordshire come in alongside other standby technologies such as storage and demand side response read the article by drax power ceo andy koss drax given green light to complete biomass upgrade saving 12 million tonnes of carbon every year uncategorized the third generating unit at drax power station has been given european commission ec approval to be fully powered by sustainable biomass drax can now complete the upgrade of the third of its six units to run on wood pellets the third unit upgrade started in july 2015 and now half the power station will produce renewable electricity saving 12 million tonnes of carbon each year drax produces enough renewable electricity to power three million homes in the first six months of this year 20 of the countrys renewable power was provided by drax the government has set out proposals to end coalfired generation by 2025 as part of its plan to stimulate more clean energy generation the ecs decision gives approval to the governments support for the upgrade of drax power station from coal to biomass and marks the culmination of a 650 million investment andy koss drax power ceo said drax now leads the world in biomass technology  three million households are powered with renewable energy generated by drax and were the largest carbon saving project in europe we have demonstrated how to reinvent a coalfired power station using an existing asset so there are no hidden costs to the grid and it is quick to achieve this is a testament to the expertise and ingenuity of our engineering team and everyone at the power station mr koss said that what has been achieved to date at drax showed the power station could help switch from coal in an affordable way for bill payers sooner than the 2025 deadline the energy challenge facing the uk is how to replace the contribution currently made by coal biomass technology is proven ready to go and ideally placed to help the country transform to a low carbon future with reliable secure and affordable renewable power he added with the right support from the government we could upgrade the remainder of the power station to run solely on biomass and provide up to eight per cent of the uks total electricity from sustainable sources the ec approval follows the recent announcement by drax that it is diversifying its power generating capability it is developing plans to build four stateof theart rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt power stations which could at the flick of a switch be running at capacity within ten minutes these more flexible plants will provide system support to the grid and plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables like solar and wind the proposed rapid response gas projects would further assist in getting coal off the system and so help the government achieve carbon saving targets the uk energy system is changing and so is drax this is the next step for us in helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future said andy koss notes to editors drax calculates that with half of its six units completed it will save 12 million tonnes of carbon every year making an important contribution to helping the government meet its targets to tackle climate change upgrading to biomass saves more than 80 per cent of the carbon dioxide emissions compared to the use of coal two other units at the power station in north yorkshire were previously upgraded in 2013 and 2014  the upgrade of the third unit makes it the largest decarbonisation project in europe and britains biggest single site renewable power generator generating 20 of the uks renewable power a new report into the uks energy sector first published last month november by imperial college london in collaboration with drax showed biomass has helped contribute to a 56 fall in carbon emissions from electricity in the last four years this report titled electric insights also revealed that biomass generation has increased since 2010 from zero to 2gw enough to supply four per cent of the electricity used every day in the uk researchers at oxford economics studied the impact of drax group on the uks economy and found it contributed 493 million towards the gdp of yorkshire and the humber in 2015 and supported 4500 jobs in the regions economy  their report also estimates that the groups activities and that of companies in its supply chain last year contributed 12 billion to the uk economy and supported 14150 jobs 9
