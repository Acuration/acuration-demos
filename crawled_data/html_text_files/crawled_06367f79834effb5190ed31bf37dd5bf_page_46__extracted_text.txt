archives press release application for 8090m gas fired power station accepted for examination by the planning inspectorate 21 june 2018 press releases the examination of the development consent order dco application should get under way in the autumn with the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy expected to make a decision on the proposals next year prior to submitting its application for the dco to build a 299mw rapid response gas power station apl consulted widely with local people to ensure their views were taken into consideration if approved up to 150 jobs will be supported during the construction of the plant and once built it will produce enough electricity to power 150000 homes  equivalent to a city around the size of cardiff david ball project director from drax said were very pleased that our application for this rapid response gas power station is progressing through the planning process this type of power station is designed to be able to be up and running quickly  in as little as 20 minutes  helping to keep the lights on when the system needs support ends notes to editors local people can have their say on the proposals during the examination of the application by the planning inspectorate apl will now formally notify city  county of swansea council the community councils in the near vicinity of the site local landowners and other statutory consultees of its proposals they will receive a copy of the accepted application documents in addition a notice will be published around the site and in local and national media to publicise the accepted application the notice will provide information to local people on where they can review the application and how and when they can make representations to the planning inspectorate the planning inspectorate will appoint an independent inspector known as an examining authority to oversee the examination of the application a process that is likely to start in the autumn anyone who makes a representation can register to become an interested party once the examination starts a preliminary meeting with interested parties apl and the examining authority will be held to coincide with the start of the examination process this meeting will be held locally and interested parties will be given at least 21 days notice of the meeting at this meeting the examining

stations capacity will produce renewable power drax has already invested around 700 million in upgrading half the power station and associated supply chain infrastructure to use sustainable biomass instead of coal  transforming the business to become europes largest decarbonisation project the conversion of the fourth unit is expected to be complete over the summer returning to service in the second half of 2018 the cost of conversion is significantly below the level of previous conversions at around 30 million draxs engineers will upgrade the unit by reusing some redundant infrastructure left from when the company was first cofiring biomass with coal on a large scale around eight years ago a trial last year confirmed that by modifying the old cofiring delivery system compressed wood pellets can be delivered in the quantities required to fully convert the fourth generating unit andy koss drax power ceo said switching the fourth unit from coal to biomass is another milestone in the transformation of the power station it will extend the life of the plant protecting jobs both here at drax and in the supply chain whilst delivering cleaner reliable power for millions of homes and businesses the conversion thats underway is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we have at drax the team has developed some very innovative solutions for this upgrade using all the knowledge weve gained throughout the work we have done so far to transform the business using sustainable biomass once it comes back online the fourth unit will help the power station at selby in north yorkshire to deliver vital reliable and flexible power needed by the grid to maintain secure supplies as more renewables come online and the sector continues to decarbonise once the conversion is complete drax will turn its attention to its remaining two coal units which it plans to replace with gasfired power generating units the closed cycle gas turbines it is looking to develop could deliver up to 36gw of capacity as well as up to 200mw of battery storage draxs plans for the gas project have been submitted to the planning inspectorate which has 28 days to determine if it will accept the application if accepted the proposals will be examined by the planning inspectorate and then considered by the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy with a decision expected in 2019 in the uk there has been an 84 per cent reduction in coalfired power generation in the last five years as low carbon generation has increased ends media contacts jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07712 677177 editors notes drax welcomed the uk governments response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme published in january it proposed that rather than imposing a cap on renewable obligation certificate roc support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all units receiving rocs this will protect existing converted generating units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum as a result once the unit is converted this summer drax expects to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax also has a biomass generating unit which receives support under the contract for difference cfd scheme this unit is unaffected by the government consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the ro scheme the fourth generating unit at drax was switched on in 1986 when the second half of the power station known as drax b began generating power from coal this was 12 years after the first half of the power station began generating power in 1974 drax converted its first three coal units to use biomass between 2013 and 2016 65 of the electricity drax produced in 2017 was renewable  enough to power four million households drax signed up to the powering past coal alliance in april  the ukcanadian initiative seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries drax is the most efficient power station in the uks coal fleet and draxs fourth unit would have been one of the last to close

station will also be carried out to assess potential capture rates fgd equipment is vital for reducing sulphur emissions from coal but has become redundant on three of the generating units at drax that have been upgraded to use biomass because the wood pellets used produce minimal levels of sulphur depending on the outcome of a feasibility study the ccapture team will proceed to the second phase of the pilot in the autumn when a demonstration unit will be installed to isolate the carbon dioxide produced by the biomass combustion will gardiner ceo drax group said if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must  and beccs is a leading technology to help achieve it this pilot is the uks first step but it wont be the only one at drax we will soon have four operational biomass units which provide us with a great opportunity to test different technologies that could allow drax the country and the world to deliver negative emissions and start to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere unlike previous ccs projects drax has been involved with this is an early pilot for a new technology it will examine the potential of a new form of carbon capture post combustion on biomass rather than coal the governments clean growth strategy identified beccs as one of several greenhouse gas removal technologies that could remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation claire perry energy  clean growth minister said we aim to make the uk a world leader in carbon capture usage and storage a key part of our modern industrial strategy its hugely exciting that drax has chosen to invest in this innovative project demonstrating how government support for innovation can create an environment where companies can develop new technologies and scale up investment to build the sectors we will need to achieve long term decarbonisation ccapture is a spinout from the department of chemistry at the university of leeds established through funding from ip group plc chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds said we have developed fundamentally new chemistry to capture co 2 and have shown that it should be suitable for capturing the carbon produced from bioenergy processes the key part is now to move it from our own facilities and into the real world at drax through the pilot scheme we aim to demonstrate that the technology weve developed is a costeffective way to achieve one of the holy grails of co 2 emissions strategies  negative emissions in power production which is where we believe the potential co 2 emissions reductions are likely to be the greatest andy duley director of commercialisation at the university of leeds said the university has an established track record in working with private sector investors and leveraging its own funds to launch successful spin out companies ccapture is

exposed the countrys undue reliance on the biggest electricity interconnector with europe a new report shows despite great britains power demand surging as temperatures plummeted the interconnector actually exported power to france on two of the coldest days  28 th february and 1 st march the six days from february 26 to march 3 were the third coldest experienced this century these freezing temperatures pushed up power demand 10 per cent as consumers and industry used more electric heating to keep warm in response to increasing demand and more limited supply wholesale power prices surged five times the average for the quarter peaking at 990 per mwh as the market became volatile however despite surging demand and higher prices great britains interconnector exported power to europe on two of the six coldest days as prices on the continent rose even higher than the uk to meet increasing demand from french consumers who use more electricity for heating than in the uk great britainss interconnector with france can demand up to 2gw of the countrys demand  around 4 per cent it represents 50 per cent of the uks interconnector capacity with the remainder accounted for by transmission between the uk and the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland the drax electric insights report into the cold snap published by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax also showed biomass and hydro ran solidly throughout the cold spell wind output was particularly high when it was most needed ranging from 118 to 138 gw during march 1 st  coal generation surged for the weeks surrounding the cold spell not because more output from conventional plants was needed but rising gas prices made it more economical to burn coal than fireup additional gas capacity dr iain staffell of imperial college london who coauthored the report said march 1 was the coldest spring day on record averaging 38ºc these plunging temperatures put stress on the system due to surging demand while thermal and renewable generation worked together to meet demand britains electricity link to france was less than helpful which ultimately drove up wholesale power prices andy koss ceo of drax power said while the european interconnector is an an important part of great britains electricity infrastructure it responds solely to price therefore if europe has a cold snap the country is at the end of the line leaving consumers vulnerable to security of supply and higher prices as the country looks to procure future electricity capacity the beast from the east is a
