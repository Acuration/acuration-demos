Press Release
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II
8 September 2022
Press releases

Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said:
“On behalf of Drax Group, I send my deepest condolences to the Royal Family at this incredibly difficult time. The Queen’s dedication to public service, both in the UK and across the Commonwealth, ensured that she was loved and respected by the global community and through the good times and the bad she provided the inspirational leadership that we all need from a Head of State.
“Some of the people living in the community near our Cruachan Power Station in Argyll, Scotland, will no doubt fondly recall when the Queen visited in 1965 to formally open the site. As the world enters a period of mourning, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will be remembered with great admiration and affection.”



Drax progresses plans to upgrade existing Cruachan Power Station
Press releases

The project, which is separate from the company’s proposals to build a
brand-new underground power station
at the site, could see two of the existing generating units upgraded, increasing their generating capacity by a total of 40MW, so they could power around 80,000 more homes – equivalent to a town the size of Paisley.
The work would increase the output of two of the station’s existing units from 100MW to 120MW each by utilising new design capability in pumped storage turbines whilst maximising water cycle efficiency.
Local people will have the opportunity to learn more about the proposals during an exhibition at Taynuilt Village Hall on Wednesday 14
th
September, 2pm – 6.30pm, when members of the project team will be on hand to answer questions and discuss the plans.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said
:
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, standing in-front of a generating unit at Cruachan.
“For more than half a century Cruachan has played a pivotal role in balancing the grid and keeping the lights on across the UK. By investing in this 40MW upgrade alongside the creation of a new 600MW power station at the site, Drax’s Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station would continue to play a vital role in bolstering the country’s energy security for many years to come.
“We are keen to hear from as many people as possible during the consultation event in Taynuilt, so we encourage local people to come along.”
Cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built inside a hollowed-out cavern 1km inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll’s highest mountain. Its reversible turbines enable the plant to act like a giant water battery by pumping water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.
The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases. This process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power, helping the country to decarbonise whilst cutting household energy bills.
In order to carry out the 40MW upgrade on the two existing generating units at Cruachan, Drax must secure consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 from the Scottish Government. This process is expected to take around one year to complete from the application’s submission.
If planning permission is granted, work to upgrade the existing two turbines could commence in 2026. The 40MW upgrade to the existing plant involves replacing existing turbines and generators and will not require excavation or blasting works.

Editor’s Notes
Long-duration electricity storage (LDES) can be defined as technologies that are able to respond to supply and demand variations caused by daily peaks, weather events and seasonal patterns, providing power for more than four hours at their full capacity.
A
recent report
by Aurora showed that the UK may need an eight-fold increase in long-duration electricity storage capacity by 2035.
Separately, a
report
by LCP published earlier this year showed the practice of curtailing wind power – which LDES  technologies alleviate the need for – added £806m to energy bills in Britain in 2021.
No final investment decision has yet been taken on the Cruachan 1 upgrade and this is also the case with Cruachan 2, with that development also remaining subject to the right regulatory framework with the UK Government.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
Drax’s around 3,000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties. For more information visit
www.drax.com
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in England and Scotland. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is also where Drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology BECCS within its CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) Incubation Area.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.
The Group also aims to build on its BECCS innovation at Drax Power Station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative CO2 emissions each year from new-build BECCS outside of the UK by 2030 and is currently developing models for North American and European markets.
Pellet production and supply:
The Group has 18 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year.
Drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030, which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity. The pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in Europe and Asia for the generation of renewable power.
Drax’s pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in North Yorkshire, England to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses, and also to customers in Europe and Asia.

Drax Power Station shines a White Rose across Yorkshire
1 August 2022
Press releases

The white rose of York will appear on one of Drax Power Station’s cooling towers on Monday August 1 as the renewable energy company joins with other businesses and organisations across the county in marking the annual event, which promotes the historic county.
Drax Power Station near Selby in North Yorkshire, is the UK’s largest renewable power generator, producing enough renewable electricity for four million UK homes. It also now aims to deliver the world’s biggest carbon capture in power project using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Power Station Plant Director said:
“We’re proud to be part of the local community and wanted to do something special to celebrate Yorkshire Day.
“This is a county with a rich heritage in delivering innovative, first of a kind, projects, which have had a lasting impact here in Yorkshire and around the world. At Drax we hope to build on this tradition of innovation by developing the world’s biggest carbon capture in power project and becoming a global leader in the vital green energy technology BECCS.
“By delivering this critical negative emissions technology at this power station here in the heart of Yorkshire, Drax will support UK energy security as well as net zero, whilst creating thousands of jobs and exciting global export opportunities.”
Drax has
submitted plans
to build two BECCS units, creating and supporting tens of thousands of jobs across the North.
Work to build BECCS at Drax could start as soon as 2024 and once operational the two units combined will capture at least 8 million tonnes of CO
2
per year, making it the largest carbon capture and storage project in power in the world.
The White Rose will be projected onto the 114m tall cooling tower at Drax Power Station from 9:00pm until 12:00am on Monday 1
st
August.

Notes to editors:
Electricity has been generated at Drax since 1974 when it was developed by the Central Electricity Generating Board, in an area of Yorkshire known as Megawatt Valley due to a fleet of coal-fired power stations built there in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.
Drax was the biggest and one of the most advanced and efficient coal-fired power stations ever built in the UK. Nearly five decades on, Drax has become the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe by using sustainable biomass.
From Yorkshire to the world – some of the county’s best loved innovations:
Sheffield opened the world’s first football club in 1857
The first commercially viable steam locomotive, called Salamanca, was designed and built by manufacturer Matthew Murray in 1812 – in Holbeck, West Yorkshire.
Some say that cinema was invented in Leeds with the first piece of true film ever recorded there in 1888.
In 1913 stainless steel was invented in Sheffield
Catseyes, the road markings, were invented in 1934 by Percy Shaw in Halifax
George Cayley, a Scarborough-born engineer, built the world’s first full-sized glider and in 1853, beat the Wright brothers to the sky by 50 years.
Yorkshire puddings – the eponymous accompaniment to Sunday lunch, first appeared in a recipe book in 1737.
Fizzy drinks were invented in Leeds in 1767
Wensleydale Cheese made infamous by Wallace and Gromit, was first made in North Yorkshire by monks in the 1100s.
Liquorice Allsorts, Terry’s Chocolate Orange, Jelly Babies, Fruit Pastilles, Jelly Tots, Polo Mints and Kit-Kats are more recent 20
th
century delicacies which hail from Yorkshire.
Drax illuminated one of its cooling towers in
blue lights
in 2020 in recognition of the work of the NHS during the pandemic, and also projected a
poppy
onto the cooling towers to raise money for the Royal British Legion on Armistice Day.
Most recently, the cooling towers were lit up in
red and blue
to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee.

University of Oxford sustainability students visit Britain’s biggest renewable power station
19 July 2022
Press releases

The group of students were taken on a full tour of the site, which included seeing Drax’s Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot project. BECCS is a vital negative emissions technology which Drax plans to use to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, whilst also generating the reliable, renewable electricity the country needs.
They also met two of Drax’s leading experts, Dr Cat Reynolds, BECCS Strategy & Engagement Senior Manager and Michael Goldsworthy, Head of Climate Change & Carbon Strategy, on how the company has transformed to become the UK’s biggest producer of renewable electricity and plans to go even further by deploying BECCS.
Dr Cat Reynolds said:
“It was great to have the students from the University of Oxford here at Drax. The subject matter of their course is extremely relevant to us and reflects what Drax is trying to achieve in moving towards becoming a carbon negative company and developing an environmentally and economically sustainable business model for BECCS.
“I hope the tour helped them get a better understanding of the cutting edge technologies we’re pioneering at Drax and the decision-making challenges that businesses at the forefront of addressing the climate crisis face. The students asked some fantastic questions which show they are ready to put their studies into practice as they move on from academia and into business roles.”
During the tour, the group were shown how renewable electricity is generated and how sustainable, wood pellets have enabled Drax to reduce its carbon emissions by 95% in a decade, making it Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
They saw the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity, as well as the wood pellet storage domes – each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 115m high cooling towers, which are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Dr Laurence Wainwright, Course Director MSc in Sustainability, Enterprise and the Environment, said:
“The inaugural cohort of the MSc in Sustainability, Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford were thrilled to visit the Drax Biomass power station in Selby. The new course addresses two pervasive and unmet challenges of our time: making the transition to a zero-carbon and environmentally sustainable economic model, whilst simultaneously enabling sustainable development for all.
“Touring the power station and hearing from their top scientists enabled students to better understand the challenges and opportunities involved in the transition to net zero. Particularly in terms of understanding the nuances and operational realities that often aren’t visible from a lecture theatre. The students greatly enjoyed and benefitted from the visit.”

Drax and Selby College aim to spark students’ imaginations
15 July 2022
Press releases

At an event attended by over 170 Year 9 pupils from four different local schools, the teenagers had the opportunity to participate in a range of fun, informative and challenging activities provided by Drax, including an Electrical Circuit Problem Solving session.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Plant Director said:
“Through events like these we can engage young people in fun STEM activities, introducing them to future skills, training, and employment opportunities. It’s important for innovative companies like Drax to work with schools and colleges to engage with and inspire the next generation, because they will eventually become our workforce of the future.”
A group of Drax’s graduate engineers and analysts delivered an ‘It’s All About Energy’ session where students explored and debated the pros and cons of new energy technologies.
Jane Breach, Drax Visitor Centre and Community Engagement team Leader, who organised the activities, said:
“It was great to see everyone enjoying the activities and using their problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. It builds on what they’ve already learnt in their school curriculum and gives them an insight in the wide range of applications for STEM subjects.”
Students also had the opportunity to try out virtual reality headsets, use electromagnetics and have a go at coding in sessions run by Selby College tutors.
They also spent time in the College’s state-of-the-art Institute of Technology laboratory where they were able to see first-hand how an automated manufacturing line works.
Lorraine Cross, Group Executive Director of External Relations & Development at the Heart of Yorkshire Education Group, said:
“Encouraging young people to excel in STEM subjects is high on our agenda, so it’s fantastic that we are able to work with leading employers like Drax to facilitate events such as this.
“They give students a unique opportunity to further explore STEM subjects and the career options and opportunities which they can open doors too, at a crucial stage in their learning. We hope the students enjoyed the event and left feeling inspired to pursue their progression in STEM areas.”
In March 2022, Selby College officially merged with Wakefield College to form the Heart of Yorkshire Education Group. As part of its School Partnership programme, the Group works with local schools, employers and learning providers to transform learning, raise attainment and achievement and encourage progression across the region.
In 2020, Drax announced a £180,000 five-year partnership with Selby College, aimed at supporting education and skills. Last year, Selby College and Drax secured more than £270,000 of funding from the government to develop the UK’s first educational programmes in carbon capture, enabling the renewable energy company to develop a workforce fit for the future.

Drax submits plans to build world’s largest carbon capture and storage project
12 July 2022
Press releases

Drax has submitted plans to build its multi-billion-pound bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project at its North Yorkshire power station.
Work to build BECCS could start as soon as 2024 with the creation of tens of thousands of jobs across the North
Submission incorporates feedback obtained during two major public consultations
Once operational Drax’s two BECCS units will permanently remove at least 8 million tonnes of CO
2
each year from the atmosphere.
The company plans to invest £2bn in the 2020s in its plans to develop two bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) units, creating and supporting thousands of jobs in the North and enabling the UK to lead the world in a vital new technology needed to address the climate crisis.
Work to build BECCS at Drax could start as soon as 2024 and once operational the two units combined will capture at least 8 million tonnes of CO
2
per year, making it the largest carbon capture and storage project in power in the world.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said:
Drax CEO, Will Gardiner
“Drax’s BECCS project provides the UK with a once in a generation opportunity to kickstart a whole new sector of the economy and lead the world in a vital green technology needed to address the climate crisis.
“Drax aims to invest billions of pounds and create thousands of jobs developing BECCS in the UK, provided that the UK Government has in place policies to support the feasibility and delivery of negative emissions technologies.
“BECCS at Drax will not only permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, but it will also generate the reliable, renewable power this country needs. No other technology can do both.”
The submission of its application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Planning Inspectorate marks a major milestone in the project and follows two major consultations carried out by Drax, which sought to gain views from the public and key stakeholders on its BECCS plans.
Deploying BECCS on two of its generating units will support Drax’s plans to become a carbon negative company by 2030 – permanently removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is produced right across its operations.
Drax plans to source up to 80% of the materials and services it needs to build its BECCS project from British businesses. It recently announced a partnership with British Steel to identify opportunities to source the steel to build BECCS from its Scunthorpe and Teesside steelworks.

Editor’s Notes
The Planning Inspectorate accepted Drax’s application for a Development Consent Order for its UK BECCS project in June and will examine the plans before making a recommendation to the Secretary of State with a final decision expected next year.
The world leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC say BECCS is a vital negative emissions technology required globally to reach the climate targets set out in the Parish Climate Accord in 2015.
Negative emissions technologies are essential because they can permanently remove the CO
2
accumulating in the atmosphere, which is causing temperatures to rise.
Once up and running, Drax’s CO
2
from Drax’s BECCS units would be transported via pipeline to the Endurance storage site, under the North Sea. This part of the process is being developed and by
The Northern Endurance Partnership
.
Drax is part of the East Coast Cluster, a partnership between Zero Carbon Humber and Net Zero Teesside. The East Coast Cluster was
selected by the UK government
to be one of two priority industrial clusters to progress plans for carbon capture in the 2020s.
The Humber and Teesside account for more than half the UK’s industrial emissions, so decarbonising these regions would have a major impact on the UK’s target to reach net zero by 2050.
