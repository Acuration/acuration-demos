visit us vikings airships and ash the history of barlow mound 10 january 2017 sustainable business barlow mound is a haven for wildlife more than 100 different species call it home including kingfishers roe deer and falcons its an area that looks like its never been touched by the industrialisation that surrounds it the truth is very different barlow mound is manmade it was built in the 1970s using residue material from its neighbour drax power station its a success story of using what was then considered a waste material to create something natural and beautiful but it has a long history before becoming what it is today and to explore that history is to track the outlook of the uk over the last millennium the military moves in the area around barlow and drax was an important location for the very first viking explorers who arrived here from the north sea via the regions ouse and aire rivers but it wasnt until 1086 that it received its first recorded mention when it was listed as berlaileag in the domesday book translating to a clearing where barley grew it was named by anglo saxon settlers who established the region as a mix of farmland fields and woodlands and it remained agricultural until the early twentieth century when the country was plunged into war when the first world war began in 1914 and the need for new war machines arose sir w g armstrong whitworth  co ltd a manufacturing company which had obtained the land in 1913 from the estate of lord londesborough set up an airship factory on the site during its lifetime the factory constructed three airships the 25r r29 and r33 but when wwi ended and demand for airships sank the factory shut down and the land passed to the ministry of defence mod during the second world war the area became an important location in the countrys war efforts once again the mod set up an army ordnance and command supply depot manufacturing and storing items like mess tins and kerosene lamps at one point the site also included a prisoner of war camp by the 60s the uks needs for defence manufacturing had subsided instead what it needed was more power with the rich coal seams of the area and the existing rail network the hullbarnsley line ran through building a power station in the barlow area was an obvious solution  firstofakind solution in 1967 the land was bought by the central electric generating board cegb which began the construction of drax power station one of the early challenges it faced was how to minimise the environmental impact to the surrounding countryside in particular it needed a solution for the tonnes of ash that came from the burning of coal fuel which included both pulverised fuel ash pfa and furnace bottom ash fba the answer was a firstofakind build a mound using the materials construction on barlow mound began in 1974 first the existing top soil was removed and preserved for later use drains were added and then a layer of fba was laid next conditioned pfa was added and moulded to suit the original design never reaching higher than 36 metres at this height the mound would visually obscure the power station from the neighbouring houses the final step was to seal the mound with a polymer and then reintroduce the top soil before grass trees and hedgerow were planted the trees and plants had been carefully tested to ensure that their roots wouldnt interfere with the ash and compromise the integrity of the structure an ecologically important area as time has passed and drax power station has produced more ash the mound has developed and grown more than 301 million m 3 is stored in the current site  more than the capacity of three million double decker buses in addition to the 100 species living on the site a tenant farmer works 20 fields and a swan rescue and wildlife hospital rehabilitates up to 2000 birds a year more recently the skylark centre and nature reserve has now opened up the area to the public to explore walking trails and see the nature firsthand barlow is an area that has changed consistently since 1086 from the norths early beginnings as an agricultural hub and anglosaxon settlement to the necessity for largescale power solutions and to the importance of preserving local ecology barlow is an area that has been characterised by the outlook of the country like drax power station to which it is intrinsically linked barlow mound is a part of the northern yorkshire landscape  literally and figuratively tags sustainability  power station  coal  history  visit us  nature reserve this train isnt like any other in the uk 25 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the sight was the same day after day trains pulling opentop wagons filled with coal would arrive at drax power station coal was the fuel on which the station ran but as that changes and the world moves from the dirtiest of fossil fuels to renewables and other lower carbon technologies so too do the makeup of draxs daily deliveries now more than half of draxs power is generated from compressed wood pellets instead of coal the trains still arrive daily but in addition to coal carriages more are pulling stateoftheart biomass wagons theyre not only the first of a kind theyre bigger than any others on uk railways moving a modern fuel coal and biomass are fundamentally different whereas coal is a durable fuel that can be left open to the elements without concern if compressed wood pellets are left in the rain they become unusable in short traditional hoppers the large opentop train wagons used to transport coal arent big enough nor do they provide enough protection for transporting biomass to deliver roughly 20000 tonnes of wood pellets to the power station every day it would need an entirely new railway wagon for this drax turned to lloyds register rail now ricardo rail  and wh davis  putting a lid on it one of the first things to solve was the open top the team designed a pneumatically operated roof for each wagon that could open and close on demand  providing easy access for loading but suitable protection for the pellets when in transit a similar system on each wagons base was introduced to make unloading just as simple a typical hopper design includes a wide roof that narrows into a shoot at its base for releasing fuel the drax wagons are different when they arrive at the power station automated flaps on their underside open in stages as they pass through the biomass unloading area this releases pellets into a sorter that delivers them into storage ready to be used for generation with this system in place each train can unload in under 40 minutes the big problem space a more significant hurdle to overcome was the question of space the obvious answer was to make the wagons bigger but uk railways have some of the most restrictive dimensions in the world thanks to its bridges and tunnels  some of which were constructed in victorian times so to get a similar efficiency out of the compressed wood pellet loads as previously obtained with coal the wagons needed to be bigger  not in physical size but in volume the team looked to the normally unused space at the ends of traditional wagons to house the braking and control equipment cubicle while the pipework was designed to run inside the wagons siding creating more inside storage space the result is a wagon with 116m 3 capacity almost a 30 increase in volume compared to the coal wagons they are not only the first ever bespoke biomass wagons theyre also the largest on uk railways bigger wagons better economy the impact of these wagons is felt beyond just the railway lines wh davis is the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer and relationships like this are not only good for drax but positively impact the wider uk economy a joint study by oxford economics for drax calculated that in the east midlands where wh davis is headquartered drax supports 1100 jobs through its supply chain and the resulting economic activity in total the report found drax had added 603 million to the local economy through indirect and induced means nationwide in 2015 that impact extended to a total of 124 billion in contribution to the uk gdp and more than 14000 jobs theres potential for this impact to be even greater roughly 14 trains arrive every day at the power station from ports in liverpool  tyne immingham and hull delivering up to 20000 tonnes every day to fuel the three of draxs six generating units that run on wood pellets but if all six are upgraded it will mean more biomass more deliveries and more trains the railways have always been a part of the power station and in the foreseeable future its likely they always will be tags supply chain  technology  engineering  railways and trains  visit us if youre afraid of heights dont do this job 27 october 2016 power generation be they for nuclear coal or biomass power cooling towers and their colossal tapering silhouettes are the most iconic element of the architecture of energy drax has 12 of them but a structure of that size poses a considerable maintenance challenge for the first time since draxs six towers were constructed between 1967 and 1974  one of them was in need of repair what could possibly go wrong no matter how well you build something things can go wrong after more than five decades of continuous operation each tower is made from concrete that varies in thickness from seven inches in the middle to around 15 inches at the top and bottom over time even a structure this solid can begin to weaken cooling towers are reinforced with steel bars embedded within their concrete which can rust and expand causing the concrete around it to crack  a process called spalling water vapour which passes through the towers on an almost constant basis can also migrate into poorly compacted concrete inside the tower and cause further cracks before the drax team could set about repairing the towers they needed to know where these cracks were inspecting a structure that tall needed an innovative solution it needed drones surveying the damage drones were used to make a comprehensive photographic record of the towers that could be inspected for signs of damage the drones also helped produce a 3d model of the structure to visualise the towers defects it was the firstofakind for the company the drone survey found that on tower 3b there were a number of cracked concrete patches on the towers that needed repairing and maintenance was scheduled to coincide with draxs 2016 outages  periods during the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the power station undergo routine repair work the next challenge was how to carry out these repairs on a structure taller than the statue of liberty to inspect the cooling tower drax created a 3d model with the help of cyberhawk  engineering at an altitude drax tower 3b is nearly 115 metres tall enough to fit in the statue of liberty or st pauls cathedral with room to spare how do you go about repairing a structure like this the answer steeplejacks steeplejacks were called so because originally they were the people used for scaling the side of church steeples to make repairs but a cooling tower presents a distinctly different structure that cant necessarily be climbed up from the bottom to scale it and make the repairs a different approach was needed drax reached out to specialist steeplejack contractors zenith structural access  who build devices that allow the scaling of industrialscale structures zeniths solution was to fix a metal frame to the top of the tower which then lowers a walkway suspended by strong metal cables down its side from a perch suspended from the top of tower 3b workmen were deployed to make the repairs  more than 100 metres above ground suspended in their cradles the teams sealed the surface of each crack and then injected resin to fix the cracks in the concrete shell where the concrete had spalled new specialist repair mortars were applied regular repairs with the identified defects on the tower fully repaired attention can now move on to others on site routine inspections using drones and binoculars have been planned to take place every three years these will monitor the condition of all the towers and allow for future maintenance to be planned in advance two more towers are already scheduled for repair in 2017s outages once again itll be case for engineering work at elevation tags biomass energy  technology  engineering  cooling tower  drax power station  visit us how do you build a dome bigger than the albert hall 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the most iconic sight at drax power station has been its large grey cooling towers but thats changing today the most striking image on the selby skyline is four white domes each larger in volume than the royal albert hall these are draxs biomass storage domes standing 50 metres high and holding 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days theyre an integral part of draxs ongoing transition from coal to renewable biomass electricity generation but while biomass is a far cleaner source of energy than coal  reducing carbon emissions by more than 80  it comes with its own challenges a key one is storage thats where the domes come in the need for a new storage space storing coal is a relatively simple task with some management by heavy vehicles to reduce the occurrence of air pockets coal can quite happily sit outside in the rain and still work efficiently as fuel compressed wood pellets are different if a wood pellet gets wet it can degrade and become unusable the main reason to compress wood into high density pellets in the first place is to take its moisture content down saving weight for transportation and increasing its efficiency as a fuel for power station boilers more than that because the biomass pellets are made from wood  a living and breathing organic material  they have to be stored in sensitively calibrated environments to keep them in a safe and usable state each storage dome had to be carefully designed engineered and constructed to ensure it was fit to maintain this environment construction began back in 2013 and required a drax engineering team working closely with idahobased dome technology and yorks shepherd construction at more than 50 metres tall theyre the largest of their kind in the world  a new approach to construction had to be considered there were three key steps involved in the build blowing up a giant balloon the first stage is to prepare the foundation which takes the form of a massive concrete circular ring beam a giant pvc airform dome is laid out over the ring beam and inflated using fans that are about the size of a doctor who telephone box to form the outside of the dome insulating the inside with the dome still airinflated a thin 15mm layer of polyurethane foam is sprayed to the inside serving to both insulate the structure and provide purchase for the first layers of steel reinforcements completing the shell once the first steel reinforcing grid is attached to the polyurethane the concrete spraying process begins the dome wall is built up to a thickness of up to 350mm by adding further layers of steel reinforcement grid and reinforced concrete under pressure the challenge the team now face following construction is maintaining a safe atmosphere inside the domes the pellets are stored inside the domes in vast quantities and weight which collectively create high amounts of pressure as the pressure builds up the pellets release oxygen which can cause a buildup of heat and potentially an explosion but by addressing the cause of the increase in heat  the oxygen  the team found they could limit the danger potential the solution was a speciallydesigned system that releases nitrogen into the dome the gas forms nonflammable compounds with the oxygen which keeps the inside of the dome stable the drax cooling towers are still visible in and around selby and while theyre still an essential part of the power station emitting steam not smoke used in the generating process theyre no longer its most iconic image the four storage domes sitting beside them more closely represent the future of drax a renewable one built on biomass technology now that the domes have been built find out how their atmosphere is controlled  tags power station  visit us  careers  technology summer in the station power generation bees buzz and heat haze fizzes on the tarmac its summer and since the days are warm and long demand for electricity sinks as lights are left off and life is lived outdoors electricity demand is lower so the assumption would be that activity at the uks power stations is minimal the reality however is far different instead the fall in demand is an opportunity to perform crucial maintenance work  to upgrade and extend the life of power stations across the world in many ways summer in the station is the busiest time of the year slowing the beating heart of the country to get up close and personal with the equipment and carry out major repairs large sections of the power station need to come offline  this is a procedure called an outage at drax power station there are six units which together supply around 78 of the uks supply taking one offline is a big project but a necessary one many years ago we use to do a mixture of major and minor outages but we have reconfigured the outage cycle so all we do now are major outages now we run a schedule where each unit has an outage every four years says andrew squires outage manager at drax this year each of our six units have come offline  five outages have already been completed and one is set to be back in service at the beginning of november with two of these being major outages and the other four taken off the system for essential high pressure hp turbine module repair works to ensure this all operates smoothly planning starts early the process starts a minimum of a year in advance during which time scoping planning parts and materials are ordered for the outage its a necessary advance given the challenging timescales projects and numbers of people that are needed to carry out the work required calling in the helping hands drax drafts in engineering contractors in large numbers to carry out the huge scale of work required to shut down and maintain units at the power station 2016 was a particularly busy year  at peak points 3500 people were on site carrying out the work its a number weve never seen previously squires says main projects delivered during the outage timescale in 2016 include changing the generator stator core generator transformer oil burner system and hp turbine module the main steam pipework replacement being the largest of all this pipework runs from the boiler to the turbine and is the first time this had been done in the lifetime of the plant now complete this is set to last the life of the station industry pioneers drax uses compressed wood pellets in three of its six units and this pioneering step brings implications for how theyre maintained in the industry its a whole new challenge for which drax engineers are still writing the rulebook were understanding the engineering implications of using biomass in our boilers and developing strategies for maintenance says squires as europes largest decarbonisation project maintaining and consistently learning comes with the territory its just another challenge for the team to tackle during summer in the station and beyond tags technology  power station  engineering  careers  visit us the biggest balls of electricity generation power generation when making a cup of tea its unlikely you consider the industrial equipment kicked into action the moment you switch on your kettle and of all of the activity going on behind the scenes its even more unlikely you think about a 12tonne steel ball but without a number of 12tonne balls and the electricity they help generate your kettle would be nothing more than a fancy jug how do giant balls help to generate power the answer lies in the way fuels like coal and compressed wood pellets are used to power boilers and generate electricity drax started its life as a coal power station but today it is in the process of upgrading to run on biomass progress has already been made  three of the stations six units already run on compressed wood pellets draxs biomass fuel generating around 20 of the uks renewable electricity to generate enough power to supply 8 of the uks demand  as drax does  a lot of fuel is needed hundreds of thousands of wood pellets are delivered to drax every day arriving on custombuilt trains travelling from the ports of tyne hull immingham and liverpool the pellets pass through a system of conveyor belts until they arrive at one of four massive conical storage domes  located on site in yorkshire before the wood pellets can be converted into fuel they need to be crushed this is where the balls come into play the pulveriser the wood pellets used at drax are compressed and dried wood that is formed into small capsules the size of a childs crayon  but like with coal to get the best results in the power stations huge boilers the material needs to be turned into a very fine powder in pulverising mills when very fine the fuel burns as efficiently and as quickly as a gas inside each mill are 10 giant steel balls that grind down either the wood pellets or coal each ball is three quarters of a metre in size made of hollow cast steel alloy and weighs roughly 12 tonnes  equivalent in weight to britishmade jaguar xe midsized saloon car or an entire football team and to make sure that each one is up to the task of extreme pulverisation they need to be hard each one is heat treated during manufacture to make sure theyre up robust enough to consistently crush raw fuel the benefit of this durability is that they can readily pulverise fuel to feed drax boilers to power kettles across the
