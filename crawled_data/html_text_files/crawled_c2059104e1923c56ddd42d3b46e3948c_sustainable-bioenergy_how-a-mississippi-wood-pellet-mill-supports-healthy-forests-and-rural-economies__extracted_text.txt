power station how a mississippi wood pellet mill supports healthy forests and rural economies first in a series of pellet plant catchment area analyses focuses on drax amite bioenergy looks at the impact of biomass demand and if it can help to maintain healthy forests in the landscape 19 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy the landscape of the amite catchment area in mississippi is dense with forests they cover 84 of the area and play a crucial role in the local economy and the lives of the local population amite bioenergy catchment area  land area distribution by land classification  use 2017 on the states western border with louisiana near the town of gloster draxs amite bioenergy pellet mill is an important part of this local economy providing employment and creating a market for lowgrade wood amite produces halfamillion metric tonnes of wood pellets annually that not only benefit the surrounding area but also make a positive impact in the uk providing a renewable flexible low carbon source of power that could soon enable carbon negative electricity generation  however this is only possible if the pellets are sourced from healthy and responsibly managed forests thats why its essential for drax to regularly examine the environmental impact of the pellet mills and their catchment areas to ultimately ensure the wood is sustainably sourced and never contributes to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts in the first of a series of reports evaluating the areas drax sources wood from hood consulting has looked at the impact of amite on its surrounding region the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references the specific aim was to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this included the impact of harvesting levels carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products the report highlights the positive role that the amite plant has had in the region supporting the health of western mississippis forests and its economy woodchip pile at amite bioenergy 2017 the landscape of the amite bioenergy wood pellet plant amite bioenergys catchment area  the working forest land from which it has sourced wood fibre since it began operating  stretches roughly 6600 square kilometres km 2  across 11 counties  nine in mississippi and two in louisiana amite bioenergy catchment area boundary us forest service data shows that since 2014 when amite began production total timberland in this catchment area has in fact increased by more than 5200 hectares 52 million m 2  an increase in market demand for wood products particularly for sawtimber can be one of the key drivers for encouraging forest owners to plant more trees retain their existing forest or more actively manage their forests to increase production  markets for low grade wood like the amite facility are essential for enabling forest owners to thin their crops and generate increased revenue as a byproduct of producing more sawtimber around 30 of the annual timber growth in the region is pine pulpwood a lowervalue wood which is the primary source of raw material used at amite more than 60 of the growth is what is known as sawtimber  highvalue wood used as construction lumber or furniture or chip n saw also used for construction and furniture amite bioenergy catchment area  net growth of growing stock timber by major timber product source usda  us forest service the analysis shows that harvesting levels in each product category are substantially lower than the annual growth as shown in the table below this means that every year a surplus of growth remains in the forest as stored carbon amite bioenergy catchment area  harvest removals by major timber product 2017 source usda  us forest service in 2017 total timber growth was 511 million m 3 while removals totalled 241 million m 3  less than half of annual growth of that figure the pine pulpwood used to make biomass pellets grew by 152 million m 3 while just 850 thousand m 3 was removed the table below shows the ratio of removals to growth in the pine forests around amite a ratio of 1 is commonly considered to be the threshold for sustainable harvesting levels in this catchment area the ratio is more than double that amount meaning that there is still a substantial surplus of annual growth that has not been harvested amite bioenergy catchment area  annual growth removals  growthtoremoval ratios by major timber product 2017 source usda  us forest service between 2010 and 2017 the total stock of wood fibre or carbon growing in the forests around amite increased by more than 11 million m 3  this is despite a substantial increase in harvesting demand for pulpwood timber inventory by major timber product 20102017 projected values 2018 the economic argument for sustainability the timberland of the amite bioenergy catchment area is 85 privately owned among the tens of thousands of smaller private landowners are larger landowners like forestry business weyerhaeuser  companies that manage forest land on behalf of investors like pension funds and private families for these private owners as long as there are healthy markets for forest products forests have an economic value  without these markets some owners may choose to convert their forest to other land uses eg for urban development or agriculture more than a billion tree saplings have been grown at weyerhaeusers pearl river nursery in mississippi the facility supplies these young trees to be planted in the amite catchment area and across the us south strong markets lead to increased investment in better management eg improved seedlings more weeding or fertilisation thinning and selecting the best trees for future sawtimber production thinning pulpwood is part of the forest management process explains dr harrison hood forest economist and principal at hood consulting typically with pine you plant 500 to 700 trees per acre that density helps the trees grow straight up rather than outwards but once the trees begin to grow beyond a certain point they can crowd one another and some trees will be starved of water nutrients and sunlight it is therefore essential to fell some trees to allow the others to grow to full maturity  a process known as thinning at final harvest youve got about 100 trees per acre continues dr hood you remove the pulpwood or the poorquality trees to allow the higherquality trees to continue to grow these thinnings have typically been used as pulpwood to make things like paper but with the slight decline of this industry over the last few decades theres been a need to find new markets for it paper production in the amite catchment area has declined since 2010 as shown on the chart on the right whilst demand for sawtimber lumber has been increasing following the economic recovery after the recession of 2008 southern pine lumber production vs amite bioenergy catchment area delivered pine sawtimber price source southern forest products association american forest  paper association timbermartsouth us paper  particleboard production vs amite bioenergy cartchment area delivered pine pulpwood price source southern forest products association american forest  paper association timbermartsouth producing sawtimber without a market for thinnings and lowgrade wood is a challenge the arrival of a biomass market in the area has created a renewed demand  something that is even more important at the current time when there is an abundance of forest but wood prices are flat or declining slightly sawtimber prices havent moved much over the last six to eight years explains dr hood theyve been flat because theres so much wood out there that theres not enough demand to eat away at the supply pulpwood consumers such as amite bioenergy create demand for pulpwood from thinning allowing landowners to continue managing their forests while waiting for the higher value markets to recover revenue from pulpwood helps to support forest owners particularly when sawtimber prices are weak amite bioenergy catchment area mill map 2019 theres so much pulpwood out there says dr hood you need a buyer for pulpwood to allow forests to grow and mature into a higher product class and to keep growing healthy forests the picture of the overall forest in the catchment area is of healthy growth and crucially a sustainable
