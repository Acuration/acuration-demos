archives press release power station rail project named as best in class 19 september 2018 press releases the partnership between drax power station near selby in north yorkshire and davis wagon services saw a new fleet of freight wagons designed and built to deliver the biomass needed to produce renewable electricity for millions of homes it also enabled davis wagon services a north lincolnshirebased rail firm to invest 850000 in revamping a mothballed ferrybridge rail yard as a dedicated site to rebrand and maintain the power stations fleet of 225 unique freight wagons securing local jobs in the process now the programme has been named as the project of the year by industry body the rail freight group in recognition of the innovation involved in the work by drax and davis wagon services the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer the wagons which transport biomass from ports on the east and west coasts of the uk to drax are maintained at the newly reopened ferrybridge yard just over 20 miles away from the power station john hall md of davis wagon services said this is a monumental achievement for us and to be recognised in this way for the work weve done is incredible we couldnt have done it without the support of drax there are so many outstanding projects in our industry and so to be singled out like this is a huge compliment to everyone who worked on the project drax power ceo andy koss said this was an important project for us and im delighted that the innovation and hard work of everyone involved has been recognised in this way these trains deliver up to 20000 tonnes of biomass every day to the power station playing a vital part in supplying renewable power to millions of homes and businesses furthermore the project has helped support a local business and revitalise a disused facility within the northern powerhouse region which were very proud to be a part of the rail project  described as a  northern powerhouse success story in july by government minister jake berry  began in 2011 when drax appointed davis along with lloyds register rail ricardo to design and develop bespoke rail wagons to ferry biomass to the power station the largest decarbonisation project in europe it also saw davis take on the work to maintain the 225 wagons and the firm will also now rebrand each one over the next two years in new livery

port of tyne and liverpool it is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day over a sixday working week in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the uks renewable electricity each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the uk with enough electricity for a year the fuel is transported to drax via rail rather than road to further reduce carbon emissions as it is more efficient than road transportation using rail saves approximately 270000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 3262250 tonnes of c02 per year independent research by oxford economics using 2016 data showed that drax supported over 18500 jobs across the country  more than 6000 of which were across the north of england yorkshire and humber north west and north east in addition drax generated 577m for the northern powerhouse regional economy and 17 billion for the whole of

been the driving force behind britains decarbonisation this analysis shows that even with the carbon price market conditions can be such that coal power can have a resurgence the uk is getting closer to removing coal from the power system by 2025 but were not there yet even now with so much coal already removed from the system emissions from power generation would rise significantly without a strong carbon price making it very difficult to deliver the clean growth required to meet our climate targets view the report coal comeback pushes up uks carbon emissions next generation of engineers

to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme published in january it proposed that rather than imposing a cap on renewable obligation certificate roc support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all units receiving rocs this will protect existing converted generating units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum as a result once the unit is converted this summer drax expects to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax also has a biomass generating unit which receives support under the contract for difference cfd scheme this unit is unaffected by the government consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the ro scheme the fourth generating unit at drax was switched on in 1986 when the second half of the power station known as drax b began generating power from coal this was 12 years after the first half of the power station began generating power in 1974 drax converted its first three coal units to use biomass between 2013 and 2016 65 of the electricity drax produced in 2017 was renewable  enough to power four million households drax signed up to the powering past coal alliance in april  the ukcanadian initiative seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries drax is the most efficient power station in the uks coal fleet and draxs fourth unit would have been one of the last to close under the governments coal phase out plans this means drax is closing a coal unit nearly

conditioning and turn up our freezers  with demand increasing by almost 900mw the increased demand is the equivalent of an extra 25 million households or an area the size of the whole of scotland new data from drax electric insights reveals demand for electricity rises 350mw for every degree the temperature rises above 20c with temperatures peaking at 36c the electricity system has really been feeling the heat dr iain staffell of imperial college london who compiles the electric insights reports said as the temperature rises we use more cooling technology  thats everything from office air conditioning to fans all of which use electricity places like supermarkets with their large freezer sections are some of the biggest energy users  as the temperature hots up everything has to work that bit harder to keep cool global demand for cooling technology is only going to increase as temperatures and global income rise more people will be willing and able to invest in the technology which will add greater stress to the system during the summer months that being said its still far easier to manage this demand in the summer as with hot weather comes plenty of solar power thankfully were able to provide electricity for cooling thats relatively low in carbon thanks to this solar technology  its still the winter months that are the most carbon intensive as we need to ramp up gas and coal generation the increased summer demand is only expected to grow with national grid predicting that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade andy koss ceo of drax power said its no surprise that the recent heatwave has equated to a surge in demand the summer months are much greener in terms of electricity production thanks to the countrys reliance on renewables but the challenge of balancing the system is very real when there is increased solar and wind generation our biomass units not only work to meet the demand caused by the greater need for cooling but also to balance the system and provide support services to the grid drax has upgraded half of its power station in north yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass and is in the process of
