BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage)
At the heart of the energy transition
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
19 March 2021
Opinion

Will Gardiner opened the second day of the
Chatham House Energy Transitions conference
. Watch his keynote address below or scroll down the page to read his speech in full.
The energy transition is central to our purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
Drax has been at the heart of Britain’s energy system for decades. And we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector:
Drax Power Station
in Selby, North Yorkshire, is the UK’s largest power station and Europe’s largest decarbonisation project. Cruachan, our Scottish Pumped Storage facility is a key complement to Britain’s ever increasing supply of offshore wind.
Our transition from
coal to biomass
has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80% while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the UK. This month saw the
end of commercial coal generation
at Drax power station – a milestone in the history of our company and of the UK economy, too.
But the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here.
Which is why we have committed to a world-leading ambition to be
carbon negative by 2030
.
We will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with CCS, or BECCS, which will enable us to permanently
remove carbon emissions
from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of British homes and businesses depend upon.

Today, we are pioneering BECCS at Drax Power Station as part of the Zero Carbon Humber Cluster, a coalition of diverse businesses with one ambition: to create the
world’s first net zero emissions industrial cluster
.
The benefits are enormous
BECCS is a vital technology in the fight against climate change. Expert bodies such as the Climate Change Committee here in the UK and the IPCC at a global level are clear that
we need negative emissions
technologies including BECCS to reach net zero, and BECCS is central to the UK and Europe’s decarbonisation plans.
As the world’s largest, and most experienced, generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to pioneer BECCS than at Drax. The economic, social and environmental benefits are enormous.
BECCS at Drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help heavy industry in the UK’s largest emitting area decarbonise quickly and cost effectively;
It will enable the creation of tens of thousands of green jobs in the North of England, levelling up the economy and delivering a green recovery from the Covid crisis;
And it will put the
UK at the forefront of global efforts
to develop carbon removal technology in this, the year that we host COP26 in Glasgow.
The scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here.
A proven technology
We know that BECCS works and that the technology is available now. Looking at cost projections from the CCC, we also know that it is the best value negative emissions technology.
Engineer at BECCS pilot project within Drax Power Station
We have already successfully run two BECCS pilots at the power station. In 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture CO
2
from a 100% biomass feedstock. And in 2020, we began a second
pilot working with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions.
We aim to deploy BECCS at scale by 2027. To that end, earlier this month, we kickstarted the planning process for our
proposals to build our first BECCS units
, marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building BECCS as soon as 2024.
The support we need
Drax Power Station has a proud history of transformation. And today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future.
The core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close
partnership with government
. And it is this partnership that will make BECCS a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it. An effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as Drax.
We believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months.
With
COP26
later this year, making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the UK.
BECCS in context
But we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change.
Negative emissions technologies such as BECCS will be needed alongside others, for example more renewables,
electric vehicles
, energy storage, energy efficiency and hydrogen.
BECCS will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of British homes and businesses depend upon.
BECCS complements – and does not – and should not – substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans. Technologies such as BECCS have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry, aviation and agriculture – decarbonise.
This is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target. The CCC estimates that
51m tonnes of CO
2
will need to be captured via BECCS to meet net zero.
Sustainability at our core
We know that BECCS can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced. This has been fundamental to Drax’s transition from coal to biomass, and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for BECCS.
Biomass, as the UK Government has stated, is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions. So we need the
right framework
to ensure it is sourced sustainably.
As the world’s largest bioenergy producer and generator, we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability, too.
At Drax, we have invested in world leading policies, tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced. We go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an
Independent Advisory Board
, Chaired by the UK Government’s former Chief Scientific Advisor, to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in Drax’s transition to net zero.
[click to read]
Thanks to our independent
catchment area analyses
, we know more about the forests we source from than ever before. We know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests. For example, in the South East US where Drax sources most of its biomass, there is
more than double the carbon stored in forests
than there was 50 years ago.
A partnership with our stakeholders
The purpose of today’s session is to discuss all these issues and more. Our aim is clear: to enable a successful energy transition.
At Drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up BECCS technology;
To put the UK at the forefront of global efforts to reach
net zero
emissions;
And to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the North of England.
But I want your help in making BECCS as sustainable and successful as it can be.
We know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests.
Thank you very much for listening and I wish you a good and constructive session tackling this critical global challenge.

Attracting investment in emerging low carbon technologies
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
17 March 2021
Opinion

Hello everyone. My name is Will Gardiner and I am the CEO of the Drax Group. It is great to have the opportunity to speak to you today at the
Utility Week Investor Summit
and to discuss attracting investment in emerging low carbon technologies.
Drax at the heart of the energy transition
My company Drax has been at the heart of Britain’s energy system for decades. And we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector:
Drax Power Station
in Selby, North Yorkshire, is the UK’s largest power station and Europe’s largest decarbonisation project. Cruachan, our Scottish Pumped Storage facility, is a key complement to Britain’s ever-increasing supply of offshore wind.
Our transition from

end of commercial coal generation
at Drax power station – a milestone in the history of our company and of the UK economy, too.
But the drive to create a more sustainable, net zero economy means that we cannot stop here.
Which is why at Drax we have committed to a world-leading ambition to be
carbon negative by 2030
.
Engineer in the workshop at Drax Power Station
We will achieve this by increasing our capacity to generate renewable electricity, and by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with CCS, or BECCS, which will enable us to
permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere
.
We are pioneering BECCS at Drax Power Station as part of the
Zero Carbon Humber
cluster, a coalition of diverse businesses with the same ambition: to create the world’s first net zero emissions industrial cluster.
I am delighted to confirm today that the Zero Carbon Humber Cluster project has
received more than £21m in funding
from the Government’s Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to help accelerate our plans and to help transform our vision of a zero carbon industrial cluster into a reality.
The benefits are enormous
BECCS is a vital technology in the fight against climate change. Expert bodies such as the Climate Change Committee here in the UK and the IPCC at a global level are
clear that we need negative emissions technologies including BECCS to reach net zero
. And BECCS is central to the UK government and Europe’s decarbonisation plans.

kickstarted the planning process
for our proposals to build our first BECCS unit, marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building BECCS as soon as 2024.
A partnership between industry and government
Successful decarbonisation has always been a
partnership between industry and government
.
This is evident looking at the incredible rise of Britain’s offshore wind sector. As a direct response to government’s political commitment, a strong price signal, and an investable Contract for Difference mechanism, offshore wind capacity has grown from 1GW to over 10GW in a decade. And build costs are now two thirds lower than what they were 10 years ago.

At Drax, our conversion from coal to biomass was benefited from much the same framework:
The UK Government was – and continues to be – very strong in its
support for biomass
as a renewable technology to replace coal;
Our CfD mechanism has given investors the certainty they need to invest;
And successive
government’s commitment to a carbon price
that matches or exceeds that of our European neighbours has told the market that Britain is serious about decarbonising the power sector rapidly.
That combination of factors – a clear, transparent, investable framework for renewables, combined with a strong price signal from the UK government discouraging fossil fuel power generation – has been the key to driving private sector investment in renewable power technology in the UK. As a result,
the UK leads the world in decarbonising its electricity sector
, while also enabling a global technology revolution in offshore wind power. Importantly, the whole effort has been underpinned by transparency, competition and confidence in the regulatory and legal framework, all of which are critical.
Building a partnership for the future
By continuing this partnership between industry and government, the UK could become the world leader in emerging green technologies such as BECCS.
Right now, markets and regulatory frameworks for BECCS or negative emissions more broadly either don’t exist – or aren’t flexible enough – to support the scaling of the technologies we need to get to
net zero
. But the first-generation framework, as I have just described, provides a great model.
Fundamentally, we believe that we can do BECCS at a cost of less than £100/t of CO
2
, which is less than any other
negative emissions
technology available.
We know this investment will help the UK reach net zero at a lower cost than it otherwise could do.

But although we’re ready to make the investment – the UK’s regulatory system isn’t yet ready to support it.
Despite being world leaders in these areas, our carbon pricing system and financial markets don’t yet recognise the value of negative emissions, even though our political institutions and scientists say they are vital to tackling
climate change
.
There is no government defined business model for BECCS, which will be essential to signalling long term political support as well as operational support.
And despite being the best placed country in the world to develop BECCS, we risk losing out as other countries race to deploy this technology first. Just last week we saw
Aker, Microsoft and Orsted
sign a memorandum of understanding to develop BECCS in Denmark.
However, in its
ten-point plan
, the UK government has committed to outline what role biomass and BECCS will play in the UK’s transition to net zero by the end of this year. Soon it will be consulting on a new bioenergy strategy. And it has already taken evidence on Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies and consulted on CCS clusters.
This, we believe, demonstrates that a set of policies could emerge in the coming months that will support investment in BECCS.
At their core, we think these policies should capture the stability and investability of a CfD for the renewable power that we will produce, as well as deliver payment for the negative emissions. By compensating negative emissions with a credit for every ton of CO
2
they remove from the environment, the government can properly reward those technologies, and add a critical new set of tools to the fight against climate change – ultimately lower the cost of winning that battle.
This would enable Drax to invest in BECCS, begin delivering negative emissions and helping to decarbonise the North of England as soon as 2027.
With COP26 later this year, making this policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future develop here in the UK.

Negative emissions technologies such as BECCS will be needed alongside others, for example more renewables,

to ensure it is sourced sustainably.
As the world’s largest bioenergy producer and generator, we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability, too.

Ready to deliver
BECCS will be a critical green technology. And with the right support and policy framework
we could be pioneers in making it a reality
.
There is no better place to deliver BECCS than at Drax, and no better time to deliver it than now.
At Drax, we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up BECCS technology;
To put the
UK at the forefront of global efforts
to reach net zero emissions;
And to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the North of England.

Standing together against climate change
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
27 January 2021
Opinion

Tackling climate change requires global collaboration. As a UK-US sustainable energy company, with communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we at Drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders.
Joe Biden has become the 46
th
President of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change. Starting with re-joining the Paris Agreement, I am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this once-in-a-lifetime challenge.
This is why Drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic
coalition
of negative emissions producers. This can foster collaboration and shared learning between the
different technologies and techniques
for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy.

Whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead, clear long-term policies that spur collaboration, drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the UK and US’ aligned targets of reaching
net zero
carbon emissions by 2050.
Collaboration between countries and industries
What makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects. This is why the Paris Agreement and this year’s COP26 conference in Glasgow are so vital.

Our effort towards
delivering negative emissions
using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (
BECCS
) is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated, collaborative energy system. The technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions, such as the US South where our American communities operate. Carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help Drax to be carbon negative by 2030 – an
ambition I announced at COP25
, just over a year ago in Madrid.
Will Gardiner announcing Drax’s carbon negative ambition at COP25 in Madrid (December 2019).
Our cutting-edge carbon removal technologies will help the UK, and the world, hit net zero.
Experts on both sides of the Atlantic consider BECCS essential for net zero. The UK’s Climate Change Committee says it will play a major role in
tackling carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions that will remain in the UK economy after 2050
, from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise. Meanwhile, a report published last year by New York’s Columbia University revealed that
rapid development of BECCS is needed within the next 10 years
in order to curb climate change.
A variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between
10% and 20% of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon
produced annually that the International Energy Agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
We believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry, bioenergy, and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries, industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies.
A formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management,
afforestation and reforestation
, as well as technical solutions like direct air capture (DAC), as well as BECCS, would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally.
Direct air capture (DAC) facility
It would also offer flexibility in countries’ paths to net zero emissions. If one approach under-delivers, other technologies can work together to compensate and meet CO
2
removal targets.
As with renewable energy,
working in partnership with governments
is essential to develop these innovations into the cost-effective, large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the mid-century.
A shared economic opportunity
I agree whole heartedly that a nation’s economy and environment are intrinsically linked – something many leaders are now saying, including President Biden. The recently approved US economic stimulus bill, supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and which allocates $35 billion for new clean energy initiatives, is a positive step for climate technology and job creation.
Globally as many as
65 million well-paid jobs
could be created through investment in clean energy systems. In the UK, BECCS and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change, but are also a
vital economic force
as the world begins to recover from the effects of COVID-19.

We all want the UK’s recovery to be a green recovery – one which benefits the North, along with the whole of the country
Government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of well-paid jobs, new careers, education opportunities and upskill workforces.
Developing BECCS at Drax Power Station
, for example, would support around 17,000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028, including roles in construction, local supply chains and the wider economy.
Additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain. This includes the rail, shipping and forestry industries
that are integral to rural communities in the US South
.
We are also partnered with 11 other
organisations in the UK’s Humber region
to develop a carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200,000 jobs around the UK in 2039.
The expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared, traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world, allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for CCUS and
biomass sustainability
.
Clear, long-term policies are essential here, not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment. These are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact CO
2
emissions and lives of people.
Engineer at BECCS pilot project within Drax Power Station
At Drax we directly employ almost 3,000 people in the US and UK, and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic. Drax Power Station is the most advanced BECCS project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cutting-edge carbon capture and removal technology. We can then share our expertise with the United States and the rest of the world – a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green economic recovery.

Sale of gas assets for £193.3 million and trading update
15 December 2020
Investors

RNS Number: 6825I
Drax Group PLC (Symbol: DRX)
(“Drax”, “the Group”, “Drax Group”, “the Company”; Symbol: DRX)
Drax is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement for the sale of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (“DGEL”), which holds four Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (“CCGT”) power stations, to VPI Holding Limited (“VPI”) for consideration of £193.3 million, subject to customary adjustments. This includes £29.0 million of contingent consideration associated with the option to develop a new CCGT at Damhead Creek.
The transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including anti-trust approval, with completion to take place by 31 January 2021.
The CCGTs have performed well since acquisition by Drax in December 2018, but do not form part of the Group’s core flexible and renewable generation strategy. Drax expects to realise a premium on sale, use the proceeds to develop its biomass supply chain and accelerate its ambition to become a carbon negative business by 2030.
DGEL also holds the Group’s pumped storage and hydro assets and is the shareholder of SMW Limited (the owner of the Daldowie fuel plant). These assets, shares and employees are to be transferred out of DGEL prior to completion and will be retained by Drax.

“By focusing on our flexible and renewable generation activities in the UK we expect to deliver a further reduction in the Group’s CO
2
emissions, which should accelerate our ambition to become not just carbon neutral but carbon negative by 2030.
“By using carbon capture and storage with biomass (BECCS) at the power station in North Yorkshire to underpin the decarbonisation of the wider Humber region, we believe we would be creating and supporting around 50,000 new jobs and delivering a green economic recovery in the North.
“We greatly value the contribution that our colleagues in gas generation have made to the Group over the last two years. As we focus on a renewable and flexible portfolio, it is right that we divest these gas generation assets and in doing so create value for our shareholders.”
Between 2012 and 2019, through investment in sustainable biomass and hydro, Drax has reduced its carbon emissions by over 85% and become the largest source of renewable electricity in the UK
(1)
.
In December 2019 Drax announced an ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030. The negative emissions provided by BECCS will offset carbon emissions within the Group’s supply chain and help to offset emissions in harder to abate sectors of the economy, such as aviation and agriculture.
In February 2020 Drax announced an end to commercial coal generation in 2021 and now, by divesting its existing gas generation assets, Drax will further reduce its carbon emissions.
Drax will continue to provide system support services alongside its decarbonisation strategy through its renewable generation portfolio, other development opportunities and demand-side response within its Customers business. These activities provide renewable electricity and a fully flexible generation and supply portfolio, which can support the UK power system as it becomes increasingly reliant on intermittent and inflexible generation sources.
About the assets and transitional arrangements
Rye House Power Station, Hertfordshire [Click to view/download]
Damhead Creek (812MW, commissioned in 2001), Rye House (715MW, commissioned in 1993) and Shoreham (420MW, commissioned in 2001) are located in the South-east of England and Blackburn Mill (60MW, commissioned in 2002) in Lancashire, England.
Drax acquired the CCGTs from Iberdrola in December 2018 as part of a portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas generation. The majority of the value in the acquisition was ascribed to the pumped storage and hydro assets, which in the first six months of 2020 provided £35 million of Adjusted EBITDA
(3)
. In the same period the CCGTs provided £18 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Group Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2020 was £179 million.
As at 30 June 2020 the gross fixed assets for the CCGTs were £182 million.
The CCGTs also have £89 million of Capacity Market income between 2021 and 2024
(4)
which will remain with DGEL on completion.
The CCGT business currently employs 121 people in operational roles who will transfer with DGEL on completion.
Drax has agreed a series of transitional services to support the transition through 2021.
Other gas projects
Drax continues to evaluate options for the development of four Open Cycle Gas Turbines and Drax Power Station following the end of coal operations.
Financial
Total consideration is £193.3 million, subject to customary completion accounts adjustments, comprising £164.3 million for the four CCGT power stations and a further £29.0 million of contingent consideration payable on satisfaction of certain triggers in respect of the option to develop a new CCGT at Damhead Creek.
The payment of £164.3 million in respect of the four CCGTs is payable in cash on completion, with an option to defer the payment of £50.0 million until April 2022. The deferred component would carry an interest rate of four percent and be backed by a letter of credit. In the event that the deferral option is exercised Drax intends to convert the payment obligation to cash upon completion for the face value.
Subject to fulfilment of pre-closing conditions, completion is to take place by 31 January 2021.
The sale price represents an expected premium compared to the book value of the assets, subject to customary adjustments and a return over the period of ownership significantly ahead of the Group’s WACC.
Biomass strategy – investment in capacity expansion and cost reduction

The proceeds from the sale of the CCGTs are expected to be used to support the development of the Group’s biomass strategy, through which Drax aims to build a long-term future for sustainable biomass. Drax aims to do this by expanding its supply chain to five million tonnes of self-supply capacity by 2027 (1.5 million today, plus 0.5 million tonnes in development) and reducing the cost of biomass to £50/MWh
(5)
.
These savings will be delivered through the optimisation of existing biomass operations, greater utilisation of low-cost wood residues and an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other low-cost renewable biomass across the Group’s expanded supply chain.
Drax believes that the additional capital and operating cost investment required to deliver this supply chain expansion is in the region of £600 million, which the Group expects to invest ahead of 2027. Drax remains alert to sector opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth.
The Group has identified three models through which it believes it can deliver a long-term future for sustainable biomass, all of which are underpinned by the delivery of its supply chain expansion and cost reduction plans. These options, which are not mutually exclusive, are summarised below. The delivery of one or more of these models by 2027 would enable Drax to continue its biomass activities when the current UK renewable schemes for biomass generation end in March 2027.
1) Merchant biomass generation at Drax Power Station
Drax believe that biomass has an important role to play in the UK as a flexible and reliable source of renewable energy, supporting increased utilisation of intermittent and inflexible generation across the UK power grid. In March 2027, when the current CfD(6) and ROC
(7)
renewable schemes end, Drax believes that through a combination of peak power generation, system support services, Capacity Market income and a low-cost operating model for Drax Power Station (including low-cost biomass), this site can continue to operate as a merchant renewable power station.
The four biomass units located in the turbine hall at Drax Power Station have a total capacity of 2.6 GW [Click to view/download]
2) BECCS
The UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) has set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050. This includes an important role for BECCS to remove CO
2
from the atmosphere, creating negative emissions. BECCS is the only large-scale solution for negative emissions with renewable electricity and system support capabilities. Through combining BECCS with its existing four biomass generation units at Drax Power Station, Drax believes it could remove up to 16 million tonnes of CO
2
per year – over two thirds of the CCC’s 2035 target for BECCS. In doing so Drax aims to become a carbon negative company by 2030.
The technology to deliver post-combustion BECCS exists and is proven at scale. In September 2020, Drax commenced a trial of one such technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). In addition, Drax is developing innovative technology options, including C-Capture, a partnership between Leeds University, Drax, IP Group and BP, which has developed an organic solvent which could be used for BECCS.

3) Third party biomass supply
Drax expects global demand for wood pellets to increase in the current decade, as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which recognise the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation. Whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed sustainable biomass material globally, there remains limited capacity to convert these materials into energy dense pellets, which have a low-carbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation. As a result, Drax expects the global market for biomass to remain under supplied. Drax is therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in Europe, North America and Asia alongside the UK. Establishing a presence in these markets could offer the potential for long-term offtake agreements, providing diversified revenues from other biomass markets.
Trading update
Since publishing its half year results on 29 July 2020 the trading and operational performance of the Group has remained robust.
In the USA, the Group’s Pellet Production business is commissioning 100,000 tonnes of new production capacity at its Morehouse facility in Louisiana as part of its previously announced plans to add 350,000 tonnes across its three existing production sites by 2022. The project is part of the Group’s plan to expand its sustainable biomass supply chain and reduce costs.
The Generation business has continued to perform well in the provision of system support services, responding to both the low and high demand needs of the UK electricity system.
In addition to the successful completion of a major planned outage and upgrade of a biomass unit at Drax Power Station, the Group has progressed its earlier stage development work on BECCS. Alongside the commencement of a solvent trial with MHI, Drax has awarded pre-FEED (Front End Engineering Design) contracts and expects to incur incremental operating costs associated with the development of a full FEED study during 2021.
At its half year results in July 2020 Drax noted that further lockdown measures in the UK in the second half of 2020 could create a small downside risk on the performance of the Customers business, principally in the SME
(8)
market. Drax is continuing to assess operational and strategic options for this part of the Group.
The Group’s expectations for 2020 Adjusted EBITDA remain in line with market expectations
(9)
, inclusive of the impact of Covid-19, principally in relation to its Customers business. Full year expectations for the Group remain underpinned by good operational availability for the remainder of 2020.

Balance sheet
As announced on 19 November 2020 the Group agreed a new £300 million ESG
(11)
Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). This replaces an RCF which was due to mature in 2021 and provides increased liquidity, enabling the full facility to be drawn as cash (the previous facility restricted cash drawn to support liquidity to £165 million). The ESG RCF is currently undrawn for cash.
In addition to the ESG RCF, the Group has agreed new infrastructure facilities (£213 million) and a Euro denominated bond issue (€250 million), which replace an existing RCF, Sterling bond and ESG term-loan, reducing the Group’s overall cost of debt and extending its maturity profile to 2030.
As at 30 November 2020 Drax had adjusted cash and total committed facilities of £643 million.
Capital allocation and dividend
The Group remains committed to its capital allocation policy, through which it aims to maintain a strong balance sheet; invest in the core business; pay a sustainable and growing dividend and return surplus capital beyond investment requirements.
Subject to the continued good operational performance and overall impact from Covid-19 remaining in line with the position Drax set out in April 2020, the Group continues to expect to pay a dividend for the 2020 financial year of 17.1 pence per share (approximately £68 million), a 7.5% increase on 2019. This is consistent with the policy to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the strategy delivers an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows.

The UK is the leader the world needs to tackle climate change
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
11 December 2020
Opinion

December 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. It represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat
climate change
and build a
better future
. However, global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treaty’s target of keeping global warming below 1.5-2 degrees Celsius.
Explore
Carbon Capture by Drax
Countries have set their own
decarbonisation
targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative – as we at Drax
intend to achieve by 2030
. While these leading ambitions are important for the UK and the world to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, real action, polices and investment are needed at scale.
We have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago. We know from the recent 6
th
Carbon Budget that renewable energy, as well as
carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS)
are essential for the UK to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
In that detailed,
1,000-page report
, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) was clear that progress must be made immediately – the country as a whole must be 78% of the way there by 2035. By investing where it’s needed, the UK can lead the world in a whole new industry. One that may come to
define the next century
.
Leading the world in decarbonisation
It was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the UK to launch the Industrial Revolution some 250 years ago. Today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world.
As a country – one that I moved to over 20 years ago now – we have decarbonised
at a greater pace than any other
over the past decade. Investing in renewable generation such as wind, solar and biomass has allowed the UK to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for
net zero emissions
.
To remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future, power grids will require
vastly increased support from energy storage systems
such as pumped hydro – as well as flexible, reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation.
However, the urgency of climate change means the UK must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing
negative emissions technologies
(which remove more carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from the atmosphere than they emit). The CCC, as well as National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios report have emphasised the
necessity of negative emissions for the UK to reach net zero
, by removing CO
2
not just from energy but other industries too.
The UK can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cutting-edge green technology that can take the country to net zero, establishing it as a world leader for others to follow.
Creating an industry, exporting it to the world
When the Paris agreement was signed, I was just joining Drax. I had been impressed by the power station’s
transformation from coal to biomass
– Europe’s largest decarbonisation project – supporting thousands of jobs in the process.
Five years on and I’m excited for the next stage: delivering negative emissions. By
deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
we can permanently remove CO
2
from the atmosphere while producing renewable electricity.
Drax has successfully piloted BECCS and is ready to deploy it at scale as part of our
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership.
Click graphic to view. Find out more about
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and negative emissions
.
I’m confident the partnership with other leading energy, industrial and academic organisations can act as a
revitalising force in a region that has historically been under-invested in
, protect 55,000 jobs and create 50,000 new opportunities.
Developing the supply chain surrounding a world-leading zero-carbon cluster in the Humber could deliver a £3.2 billion economic boost to the wider economy as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
I believe we can establish a new industry to export globally. The Humber’s ports have a long history of trade and we can build on this legacy. The machinery, equipment and services needed to develop BECCS and Zero Carbon Humber will be an essential export as the rest of the world races to decarbonise.

By providing training and partnering with educational institutions we can increase scientific and technical skills. Net zero industrial clusters can enable more in society the opportunity to have rewarding and fulfilling engineering, energy and environmental careers.
This model can reach around the world – positioning people and businesses to help countries to reach the collective goals of Paris Agreements.
The economic benefits for such achievements far outweigh the costs of failing to stem global warming and we are ready to invest in the technologies needed to do so. With robust government policies in place,
a net zero future could cost as little as 1% of GDP over the next 30 years
.
Countering climate change is a once-in-a-lifetime challenge for the world, but also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a sustainable future with sustainable jobs, improved standards of living, health and wellbeing. The UK has a responsibility to use its expertise and resources, setting in place the structures that can allow companies like mine – Drax – to lead the world to reaching the Paris Agreement’s targets and beyond.

Committing to a net zero power system as part of COP26
30 November 2020
Carbon capture

Dear Prime Minister, Chancellor, COP26 President and Minister for Energy and Clean Growth,
We are a group of energy companies investing tens of billions in the coming decade, deploying the low carbon infrastructure the UK will need to get to
net zero
and drive a green recovery to the COVID-19 crisis.
We welcome the leadership shown on the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, and the detailed work going on across government to deliver a net zero economy by 2050. We are writing to you to call on the Government to signal what this will mean for UK electricity decarbonisation
by committing to a date for a net zero power system
.
Head of BECCS Carl Clayton inspects pipes at the
CCUS Incubation Area
, Drax Power Station
The electricity sector will be the backbone of our net zero economy, and there will be ever increasing periods where Great Britain is powered by only zero carbon generation. To support this, the Electricity System Operator is putting in place the systems, products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025.
Achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing, which has been central in delivering UK leadership in the move away from coal and has led to UK electricity emissions falling by over 63% between 2012 and 2019 alone.
It is thanks to successive governments’ commitment to robust carbon pricing that the UK is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago – before the birth of the steam locomotive. A consistent, robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment low-carbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in British history in the first quarter of 2020.
Yet, even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind, more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy.
www.drax.com/uk/Captureit
In the near-term, in combination with other policies, continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation, market dispatch of upcoming gas-fired generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects and the blending of low carbon hydrogen with gas-fired generation. Further forward, a robust carbon price can incentivise 100% hydrogen use in gas-fired generation, and importantly drive
negative emissions
to facilitate the delivery of a net zero economy.
Next year, the world’s attention will focus on Glasgow and negotiations crucial to achieving our climate change targets, with important commitments already made by China, the EU, Japan and South Korea amongst others. An ambitious 2030 target from the UK will help kickstart
the Sprint to Glasgow
ahead of the
UK-UN Climate Summit
on 12 December.

and being the first major economy to adopt a net zero target continue to encourage similar international actions. To build on these and continue UK leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation,
we call on the UK to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of COP26,
to match the commitment of the US President-elect’s
Clean Energy Plan
. To ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost, the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input.
Alongside near-term stability as the UK’s carbon pricing future is determined, to meet this commitment
Government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the Budget next year, with a target date to be confirmed in the UK’s upcoming Net Zero Strategy.
This commitment would send a signal to the rest of the world that the UK intends to maintain its leadership position on climate and to build a greener, more resilient economy.
