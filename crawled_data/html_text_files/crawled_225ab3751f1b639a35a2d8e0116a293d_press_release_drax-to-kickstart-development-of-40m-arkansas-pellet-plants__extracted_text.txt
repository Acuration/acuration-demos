power station drax to kickstart development of 40m arkansas pellet plants drax group worldleading sustainable biomass production and supply company will begin constructing the first of three new satellite pellet plants in arkansas the company announced today 6 may 2021 the three plants are together expected to produce around 120000 metric tons of sustainable biomass pellets a year from sawmill residues supporting the renewable energy companys plans to increase selfsupply to its power station in the uk drax will begin construction of the first plant later this month near a west fraser sawmill in leola grant county  with commissioning expected in october the company will begin construction on two more plants in other locations in the coming months in total drax will invest 40 million in the state creating approximately 30 new direct jobs and many more indirect jobs across three arkansas communities drax has transformed its power station in the uk to become the largest decarbonization project in europe by converting it to use sustainable biomass instead of coal the development of the satellite pellet plants is part of draxs strategy to increase biomass selfsupply to five million tons by 2027 improving supply chain resilience while reducing pellet costs will gardiner drax group ceo said drax group ceo will gardiner click to viewdownload  by building these new pellet plants drax is bringing jobs and opportunities to rural communities in arkansas boosting the states postcovid economic recoverythrough this investment arkansas will play an important role in combating climate change supporting drax to increase the amount of sustainable biomass we produce as part of our plans to pioneer bioenergy with carbon capture and storage by using sustainable biomass we have displaced coalfired power generation reduced carbon emissions and provided renewable electricity for millions of homes and businesses in the uk the leola satellite pellet plant is expected to produce around 40000 metric tons of sustainable biomass pellets a year drax will also utilize the sawdust and other dry residual materials which are byproducts created when timber is processed at west frasers facility draxs ambitious company vision combined with the renowned tenacity and loyalty of arkansans make this partnership an excellent match gov asa hutchinson said i am confident that this investment will benefit both the company and our communities for years to come by colocating the pellet facilities with sawmills drax will benefit from lower infrastructure operational and transportation costs each of these three arkansas communities will be uniquely impacted by todays announcement arkansas secretary of commerce mike preston said families in different regions across the state will experience new opportunities and their communities will experience continued growth because of draxs investment i congratulate drax on this exciting news and look forward to the ways that arkansas will be influential in accomplishing the companys mission to provide renewable electricity for millions of homes and businesses reducing the costs of its biomass supports the renewable energy companys worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 by developing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this vital negative emissions technology could permanently remove millions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while producing the renewable electricity needed to decarbonize global economies and address the climate emergency drax owns and has interests in 17 other pellet plants and development projects across the us and south and western canada the company will host job fairs to recruit for positions at the leola site later this month media contacts annmarie

louisiana to oceangoing vessels each pellet plant is expected to produce 40kt per year with the total cluster expected to produce120kt per year the development of the three satellite plants comes after draxs recent acquisition of 11 pellet plants across the usa and canada making it a worldleading biomass pellet production and supply business draxs strategy is to reduce the costs of its pellets to 50mwh by 2027 in 2020 around 43 of the material used in drax power stations pellets came from sawmill residues the rest came from lowgrade material such as treetops limbs and misshapen and diseased trees not suitable for other use and thinnings  small trees removed maximise the growth of the forest about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 3400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax
