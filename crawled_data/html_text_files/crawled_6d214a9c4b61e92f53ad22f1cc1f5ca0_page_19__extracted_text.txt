investors whats next for bioenergy 11 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power today when we talk about electricity we talk about climate change about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies theyre all inexplicably linked and all hold uncertainties for the future but in preparing for whats to come it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us researchers at universities across the uk including the university of manchester and imperial college london have put their heads together to think about this question and together with the supergen bioenergy programme theyve created a unique graphic novel on bioenergy that outlines three potential future scenarios based on their imagined views of the future theres plenty to be optimistic about but it could just as easily go south future one failure to act on climate change in the first scenario our energy use and reliance on nonrenewable fuels like oil coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while its affordable neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends  energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption in response electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up which leads to several problems attempts to secure a dwindling stock of nonrenewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security as resources run out attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years the damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive future two growing a stable centralised bioenergy a future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isnt the only way forward bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future in fact nearly all scenarios where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees celsius margin recommended by the paris agreement rely on widespread bioenergy use with carbon capture and storage beccs but how far could the implementation of bioenergy go a second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major centralised features in global energy networks this limits the effects of a warming climate particularly as ccs technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground this has knockon effects for the rest of the world large tracts of land are turned over to forestry to support the need for biomass creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests in industry largescale ccs systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further future 3 the right mix bioenergy a third scenario takes a combined approach  one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of beccs energy renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives this relies on the advance of a few key technologies widespread adoption of advanced battery technology sees wind and solar implemented at scale  providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities these communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common whether future three  or any of the above scenarios  will unfold like this is uncertain these are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is its up to us all  not just governments but businesses individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too  to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want tags climate change  investors  energy policy  technology 4 of the most exciting emerging technologies in electricity generation 6 july 2017 power generation since the dawn of the industrial age the world has been powered by a relatively small set of technologies the 20 th century was the age of coal but this side of 2000 thats changed the need to curb emissions and the rise of renewables from wind to solar to biomass has significantly changed how we fuel our power generation today some of the worlds most interesting and exciting emerging technologies are those designed to generate electricity microbial fuel cells  harnessing the power of bacteria bacteria are all around us some are harmful some are beneficial but all of them breathe when they breathe oxidation occurs which is when something combines with oxygen at a chemical level and when bacteria do this electrons are released by connecting breathing microbes to a cathode and an anode the positive and negative rods of a battery the flow of these released electrons can be harnessed to generate power this is whats known as a microbial fuel cell mfc mfcs are used largely to generate electricity from waste water but are expanding into more exotic uses like powering miniature aquatic robots  new developments are constantly expanding the power and applications of mfcs researchers at binghamton university new york found that combining phototropic lightconsuming and heterotrophic matterconsuming bacteria in microbial fuel reactions generates currents 70 times more powerful than in conventional setups solar  a new dawn solar power may not be a new technology but where its going is one of the most promising developments in the space is solar voltaic glass which has the properties of a sheet of window glass but can also generate solar power rather than collecting photons like normal solar does and which transparent materials by definition cant do photovoltaic glass uses salts to absorb energy from nonvisible wavelengths and deflects these to conventional solar cells embedded at the edge of each panel or theres solar pv paint which contains tiny light sensitive particles coated with conductive materials when layered over electrodes youve got a sprayon power generator betavoltaics  nothing wasted from nuclear waste nuclear material is constantly decaying and in the process emits radioactive particles this is why extremely radioactive material is so dangerous and why properly storing nuclear waste is so important and so expensive but this waste can actually be put to good use betavoltaic devices use the waste particles produced by lowlevel radioactive materials to capture electrons and generate electricity the output from these devices can be fairly low and decreases over long periods of time but because of the consistent output of nuclear decay they can be extremely longlasting for example one betavoltaic battery could provide one watt of power continuously for 30 years  and while they arent currently fit to work on a large scale their longevity and very compact size make them ideal power sources for devices such as sensors installed on equipment that needs to be operational for long periods tidal power  changing tides a more predictable power source than intermittent renewables like wind and solar tidal power isnt new however its growth and development has typically been restrained by high costs and limited availability thats changing last year saw the launch of the first of 269 15 mw megawatt underwater turbines part of worlds first large scale tidal energy farm in scotland  around the world there are existing tidal power stations  such as the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea  which has a capacity of 254mw  but the meygen array in scotland will be able to take the potential of the technology further its hoped that when fully operational it will generate 398mw or enough to power 175000 homes we might not know exactly how the electricity of tomorrow will be generated but its likely some or all of these technologies will play a part what is clear is that our energy is changing tags tidal power  electricity generation  investors  technology this is how you unload a wood chip truck 30 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy a truck arrives at an industrial facility deep in the expanding forestland of the southeastern usa it passes through a set of gates over a massive scale then onto a metal platform the driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console slowly the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises as it does the trucks cargo empties into a large container behind it two minutes later its empty this is how you unload a wood fuel truck at drax biomass compressed wood pellet plants in louisiana and mississippi  what is a tipper some people call them truck dumpers but it depends on who you talk to says jim stemple senior director of procurement at drax biomass we just call it the tipper regardless of what its called what the tipper does is easy to explain it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently the sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the atlantic however at industrial facilities in the united states its more common tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn grain and gravel stemple explains basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping both of drax biomass two operational pellet facilities a third is currently idle while being upgraded use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark  known in the forestry industry as hog fuel which is used to heat the plants wood chip dryers  sawdust and raw wood chips which are used to make the compressed wood pellets  how does it work the tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other to ensure safety each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end where the load is emptying from so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long once tipped far enough each platform tips to a roughly 60degree angle the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for one way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles  which then goes through the pelleting process of the hammer mills the dryer and the pellet mill says stemple the other way takes it to the fuel pile which goes to the furnace the furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 115 and 12 before they go through the pelleting process if everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour says stemple from full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load efficiency benefits using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach but its also an efficient one firstly theres the speed it allows multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour and because cargo is delivered straight into the system theres no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system secondly for the truck owners the benefits are they dont need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks instead its just the tipper  one piece of equipment  which is maintained to keep operations on track however there is one thing drivers need to be wary of what they leave in their driver cabins open coffee cups food containers  anything not firmly secured  all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play i guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once stemple says the first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time tags investors  transport  wood pellets  technology  biomass energy 3 ways decarbonisation could change the world 27 june 2017 sustainable business mitigating climate change is a difficult challenge but its one well within the grasp of governments companies and individuals around the world if we can start thinking strategically on the behalf of the german government the internal energy agency iea and the international renewable energy agency irena have jointly published a report outlining the longterm targets of a worldwide decarbonisation process and how those targets can be achieved through longterm investment and policy strategies at the heart of the report is a commitment to the 66 two degrees celsius scenario which the report defines as limiting the rise in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius by 2100 with a probability of 66 this is in line with the paris agreement which agreed on limiting global average temperature increase to below two degrees celsius here are three of the findings from the report that highlight how decarbonisation could change the world the energy landscape will change  and thats a good thing decarbonisation will by definition mean reducing the use of carbonintensive fossil fuels today 81 of the worlds power is generated by fossil fuels but by 2050 that will need to come down to 39 to meet the 66 two degrees celsius scenario according to the report but this doesnt mean all fossil fuels will be treated equally coal will be the most extensively reduced while other fossil fuels will be less affected oil use in 2050 is expected to stand at 45 of todays levels but will likely still feature in the energy landscape due its use in industries like petrochemicals gas will likely also remain a key part of the energy makeup thanks to its ability to provide auxiliary grid functions like frequency response and blackstarting in the event of grid failure renewables like biomass will likely play an increasing role here as well particularly when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs technology overall renewable energy sources will need to increase substantially in the reports global roadmap for the future renewables make up two thirds of the primary energy supply reaching this figure will be no mean feat  it will mean renewable growth rates doubling compared with today everyday electricity use will become more efficient the report highlights the need for enduse behaviour to change this can mean everyday energy users choosing to use a bit less heat power and fuel for transport in our daytoday activities but a bigger driver of change will be by investment in better more efficient enduse technology  the technology devices and household appliances we use every day  in fact the study argues that net investment in energy supply doesnt need to increase beyond todays level  what needs to increase is investment in these technologies for instance by 2050 70 of new cars must be electric cars to meet decarbonisation targets infrastructure design could also be improved for energy efficiency  smart grids battery storage and buildings retrofitted with energy efficient features such as led lighting will be essential theres also the possibility of increased use of cleaner building materials and processes  for example constructing large scale buildings out of wood rather than carbonintensive materials such as concrete and steel decarbonisation will cost but not decarbonising will cost more the upfront costs of meeting temperature targets will be substantial a case study used in the report estimates that 119 trillion would need to be spent on lowcarbon technologies between 2015 and 2050 but it also suggests another 29 trillion may be needed to meet targets however failure to act could mean the world will pay out an even higher figure in healthcare costs or in other economic costs associated with climate change such as flood damage or drought therefore the sum for decarbonisation could end up costing between two and six times less than what failing to decarbonise could cost on top of this the new jobs including those in renewable fuel industries that will replace those lost in fossil fuels and opportunities that will be created between 2015 and 2050 could add 19 trillion to the global economy more than that global gdp could be increased by 08 in 2050 thanks to added stimulus from the low carbon economy achieving a cleaner future wont be easy  it requires planning effort and the will to see beyond shortterm goals and think about the longterm benefits but as the report demonstrates get it right and the results could be considerable tags investors  decarbonisation  fossil fuels why we need the whole country on the same frequency 23 june 2017 power generation the modern world sits on a volatile fizzing web of electricity in 2015 the uk consumed roughly 303 terawatt hours twh of electricity according to government statistics  thats an awful lot of power humming around and in this country we take it for granted that electricity is controlled this means the power supply coming into your home or place of work is reliable and wont trip your fuse box in short it means your mobile phone will keep on charging and your washing machine will keep on spinning but generating and circulating electricity at safe usable levels is not an easy task one of the most overlooked aspects of doing this is electrical frequency  and how its regulated what is electrical frequency to understand the importance of frequency we need to understand a couple of important things about power generation generators work by converting the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine into electrical energy in a steamdriven generator like those at drax power station  high pressure steam turns a turbine which turns a rotor mounted inside a stator copper wire is wound around the rotor energised with electricity this turns it into an electromagnet with a north and south pole the stator is made up of large heavy duty copper bars which enclose the rotor as the rotor turns its magnetic field passes through the copper bars and induces an electric current which is sent out onto the transmission system as the magnetic field has a north and south pole the copper bars experience a change in direction of the magnetic field each time the rotor turns this makes the electric current change direction twice per revolution and is called an alternating current ac there are in fact three sets of copper bars in the stator producing three electrical outputs or phases termed red yellow and blue electrical frequency is the measure of the rate of that oscillation and is measured in the number of changes per second  also called hertz hz a generator running at 3000 rpm  with two magnetic poles produces electricity at a frequency of 50hz why is this important maintaining a consistent electrical frequency is important because multiple frequencies cannot operate alongside each other without damaging equipment this has serious implications when providing electricity at a national scale the exact figure is less important than the need to keep frequency stable across all connected systems in great britain the grid frequency is 50hz in the us its 60hz in japan the western half of the country runs at 60hz and the eastern half of the country runs at 50hz  a string of power stations across the middle of the country steps up and down the frequency of the electricity as it flows between the two grids sticking to one national frequency is a team effort every generator in england scotland and wales connected to the high voltage transmission system is synchronised to every other generator when the output of any of the three phases  the red yellow or blue  is at a peak the output from all other phases of the same colour on every other generating unit in great britain is also at a peak they are all locked together  synchronised  to form a single homogenous supply which provides stability and guaranteed quality how is frequency managed the problem is frequency can be difficult to control  if the exact amount of electricity being used is not matched by generation it can affect the frequency of the electricity on the grid for example if theres more demand for electricity than there is supply frequency will fall if there is too much supply frequency will rise to make matters more delicate theres a very slim margin of error in great britain anything just 1 above or below the standard 50hz risks damaging equipment and infrastructure  see how far the countrys frequency is currently deviating from 50 hz  managing electrical frequency falls to a countrys high voltage transmission system operator the national grid in the uk the grid can instruct power generators like drax to make their generating units automatically respond to changes in frequency if the frequency rises the turbine reduces its steam flow if it falls it will increase changing the electrical output  a change that needs to happen in seconds in the case of generating units at drax power station the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension which minimises large frequency swings frequency on a fastchanging system not all power generation technologies are suited for providing high quality frequency response roles and as the uk transitions to a lowercarbon economy ancillary services such as stabilisation of frequency are becoming more important neither solar nor wind can be as easily controlled its possible to regulate wind output down or hold back wind turbines to enable upward frequency response when there is sufficient wind similarly solar panels can be switched on and off to simulate frequency response as solar farms are so widely dispersed and tend to be embedded  meaning they operate outside of the national system it is not as easy for national grid to instruct and monitor them both wind and solar have no inertia so the allimportant damping effect is missing too using these intermittent or weatherdependent power generation technologies to help manage frequency can be expensive compared to thermal power stations nor are the current fleet of nuclear reactors flexible  nuclear reactors in great britain were designed to run continuously at high loads known as a baseload power although they cannot deliver frequency response services the countrys nuclear power stations do provide inertia twenty times faster thermal power generation technologies such as renewable biomass or fossil fuels such as coal and gas are ideal for frequency response services at scale because they can be easily dialled up or down as both the fuel supply to their boilers and steam within their turbines can be regulated the 645 mw thermal power units at drax have the capability to respond to the grids needs in as little as half a second or less complete their change in output in under one second and maintain their response for many minutes or even hours before the introduction of high volumes of wind and solar generation almost all generators excluding nuclear running on the system could provide frequency response as these generators are increasingly replaced by intermittent technologies the system operator must look for new services to maintain system stability an example is national grids recent enhanced frequency response tender which asked for a solution that can deliver frequency stabilisation in under a second  20 times faster than the primary response provided by existing thermal power stations drax was the only participating thermal power station however all contracts were all won by battery storage projects frequency future given the decline in fossil fuel generation and uncertainty around our power makeup in future decades national grid is consulting on how best to source services such as frequency response the ideal scenario for national grid is one where services can be increasingly sourced from reliable flexible and affordable forms of low carbon generation or demand response the next generation of nuclear power stations as with some already operating in france can provide frequency response services however the first of the new crop hinkley c is around a decade away from being operational  likewise solar or wind coupled with battery molten salt or flywheel storage will provide an increasing level of flexibility in the decades ahead as storage costs come down thanks to power generation at drax with compressed wood pellets  a form of sustainable biomass britain has already begun moving into an era where lower carbon frequency response can begin to form the foundation

balancing for the renewable future and maintaining electricity grid stability during rapid decarbonisation  tags electricity generation  electricity  investors  energy policy  national grid how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins

of things mean for energy 2 june 2017 electrification internet of things iot technology which connects everyday appliances to one another allowing them to collect data and become smart presents an exciting view of the modern home or workspace the future iotenabled office or household is one with autonomous appliances remoteoperated thermostats and fridges that monitor their contents and reorder supplies when they run low you may never go hungry again theres arguably an even brighter future for the iots potential in industry  it can bring about value through applications like predictive maintenance and performance optimisation on paper these two scenarios  that of industrial optimisation and convenience throughout our daily lives  might seem worlds away but james robbins chief information officer at drax is thinking about how to bring them together  particularly when it comes to energy use central to the approach is a question could a better understanding of how households and businesses use energy change how its generated and provided the importance of data at its heart the iot is about data what data you collect and how you use it determines what value you can create says robbins he explains whether youre talking about the iot big data artificial intelligence ai or robotics  theyre all the modernisation of information collection and use and nowhere is this more applicable than at a largescale power station  at drax were used to managing whats basically our own private iot in the station he explains the realtime control systems we have for the generators and the grid are essentially a bunch of sensors tied to a central network these sensors collect data from the power station which then help optimise it for better performance the same approach to data collection can have benefits for bill payers too tracking energy use in the workspace and home connected devices like smart meters can bring a precise level of insight into energy usage in the home and places of work which can benefit both end users and suppliers of heat and power electricity generators and heating fuel suppliers can use this data to better manage their output by being able to predict how and when it will be required for end users it can help them and their energy suppliers more accurately track what they use where they use it and how they could use it more efficiently for example using iot technology a gas or wood pellet for heat supplier may be able to identify that a home can make substantial cost savings just by turning down their heating by one degree sensors and smart technology can give us that insight says robbins this level of optimisation is already possible to a degree using existing tools but robbins sees a future with greater possibilities for example with comprehensive datasets suppliers can compare business owners energy use with others in the same sector and region to highlight efficiencies the whole thing is about making it easier for us to serve the customer says robbins and the better the dataset the more exotic the services could be just looking at meters means we can only really talk to the bill payer but who else in the home or workplace could we engage with to get them to conserve energy for instance we could develop a game for child in the house thats linked to energy use where they get points for turning off lights or turning down heating he explains the gamification of energy use is  at this stage  just an idea robbins says but it is exactly the kind of thing that better data allows energy suppliers and generators to think about a challenging journey but an exciting one the iot approach to energy generation and use wont be without its challenges  security being one major concern but there will also be substantial technical and standardisation issues any provider keen to leverage iot must tackle to make it a truly effective technology in the 80s you couldnt play a vhs cassette in a betamax player robbins explains the compatibility issue with iot could be an even bigger problem  all these gadgets need to be built into an architecture that can handle them and make them work together consider the socalled smart meter that provides data for a customers itemised bill the bill payer is told that a tumble dryer in their home is using a significant proportion of the power they are paying for the problem is that their appliances and devices have not been meshed together in a way that gives the system sufficient context about the customers situation in the worstcase scenario the customer asks for a refund and switches supplier because they dont actually have a tumble dryer robbins and his team are working with drax suppliers to make sure that compatibility and context dont become a problem he aims to ensure that unintended consequences in the groups use of iot are only of the positive variety by investing in backoffice infrastructure that can use big data processing to ingest and analyse meter data down to the 10second level drax can take advantage of smart tech when it arrives in earnest its an exciting period of technological advancement  but as robbins is keen to point out its only the start itll probably only be over the next few years that we actually begin to really understand how to leverage iot data when we pass the tipping point of user adoption when that happens well be starting a very exciting journey with a clearer purpose  to spot and solve meaningful problems faced by people and businesses in context in realtime tags investors  technology  1  14 15 16 17
