Press Release
Selby apprentices win top prizes at Drax awards
30 October 2019
Press releases

Kai Lewis, aged 18 from Selby, won the Uniper Engineering Academy Apprentice of the Year Award and Max Shaw, 22, from Gateforth, near Selby, was named Maintenance Apprentice of the Year (Year 2).
Kai always knew he wanted a career in engineering and growing up only a few miles from Drax, he was curious about how the power station, which is the UK’s largest renewable power generator, worked.
Now, having completed two years of his apprenticeship as a technical engineer he is learning more about the important role he and the other engineers play in maintaining the power station so it can continue to produce enough renewable electricity for four million households.
Kai, who attended Snaith High School said:
“Changing Drax from a coal plant to one that could eventually be capturing carbon whilst generating power is a huge challenge that is really exciting to be a part of. Being at the forefront of that kind of innovation and learning new skills on the apprenticeship programme is a great opportunity and it’s great to be recognised for the work I’ve done with this award.”
Max, a Selby High School graduate and third year technical apprentice hopes to further his engineering career once he completes his apprenticeship. He said:
“It means a lot to win this award – it shows that all the hard work I have put in throughout the year has paid off. I’m enjoying my apprenticeship – every day I am learning something new.”
L-R: Mike Maudsley, Max Shaw and Harry Gration
Max’s passion for engineering started from a young age helping his dad, an agricultural engineer.
Mike Maudsley, Drax’s UK Portfolio Generation Director, said of the apprentice awards:
“Inspiring young people and supporting them in their early careers is essential for our business’ future. Each new cohort of apprentices brings enthusiasm and fresh ideas and we want to make sure we’re championing them.
“These awards come straight after Drax doubled the number of apprentices it hired in the space of just two years, reflecting our continued commitment to increasing education and skills across our region.”
The awards were presented by BBC Look North’s Harry Gration with 34 existing and 5 graduating apprentices attending the event along with their mentors and managers.
This year’s winners were:
Maintenance Apprentice of the Year 2019 Year 1 – Lewis Marran from Doncaster

Scottish Energy Minister visits Drax’s iconic Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station
24 October 2019
Press releases

The iconic Cruachan facility in the Western Highlands can generate flexible power within seconds during times of peak demand, helping to keep the lights on for tens of thousands of households. It also provides crucial system support services to the electricity grid, enabling more renewables such as wind and solar to come onto the network.

Mr. Wheelhouse said:
“It was fascinating to learn more about how important this unique power station is in supporting the energy system and just how quickly it can respond to changes in demand – delivering the power needed in as little as 30 seconds.
“This kind of flexibility and resilience helps to support the growth of renewables, enabling further decarbonisation of the energy system as we strive for net zero carbon emissions in Scotland by 2045.
“The real value the technology adds every day to our energy system is the reason why we, and industry partners, continue to call on UK Ministers to take action to ensure that they provide the revenue certainty developers need to underpin further proposed investments in pumped storage hydro capacity in Scotland.”
(L-R) Drax CEO Generation Andy Koss, Scottish Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse overlooking the turbine hall inside Cruachan Power Station.

CEO Generation
,

said
:
“Cruachan has been providing stability to the power network since 1965 when the turbines were first installed inside the hollowed-out mountain. As we move to a system with more renewables, the services that Cruachan provides are becoming more essential.
“I’m incredibly proud of the work done by the team and the role they play in driving decarbonisation and economic growth as we continue to deliver the power relied on by thousands of homes and businesses.”
Cruachan is
one of

four pumped storage hydro stations in the UK and has a capacity of 440 MW – enough to power more than 90,000 homes
during peak demand
.


Built on the shores of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute, it
was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world
.

The turbine hall is located 1

km within the hollowed-out mountain of Ben Cruachan and houses four generators
, supplying
a range of
vital
balancing and ancillary services
to the grid, such as frequency control, spinning and operating reserves, helping to maintain secure power supplies.

Drax acquired Cruachan along with hydro facilities in Galloway and Lanark and a biomass-from-waste plant at Daldowie, near Glasgow, at the end of last year.

Scotland is targeting
net zero carbon emissions by 2045 – five years ahead of the rest of the UK.

Drax strengthens biomass sustainability policy and appoints Independent Advisory Board
Press releases

Former UK government Chief Scientific Adviser Professor Sir John Beddington to chair new Independent Advisory Board (IAB) which will ensure Drax’s biomass sourcing meets latest scientific research and best practice
New biomass sustainability policy drawn from recommendations in a report commissioned by the European Climate Foundation
In the updated policy, Drax has outlined how it will use the latest science and best practice and work with academic institutions and non-profit organisations to meet its core commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, protect the natural environment, support people and communities and carry out research and outreach.
Drax also details the evidence the company will gather to increase transparency on its biomass sourcing and impacts. These include using big data and satellite images to evaluate the impact on forest cover and biodiversity in areas that supply the biomass the company uses.

This comes in addition to the company’s current commitment to certification through the Sustainable Biomass Program, a globally recognised certification system designed for biomass from wood for use in energy production.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner said:
Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group. Click image to view/download in high res.
“We’re committed to continuously raising standards in biomass sustainability, so our sourcing policies must evolve as the science develops.
“With stronger policies in place and an independent board to challenge us every step of the way, we will be setting the standard for others to follow, which is important as sustainable biomass plays an increasing role in addressing climate change.”
The UK government’s former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir John Beddington will chair the six-member IAB, which will provide independent advice to Drax in all areas of its biomass sourcing including procurement practises and feedstock options.
IAB Chair Sir John Beddington said:
“The IPCC and Committee on Climate Change both recognise that sustainably sourced biomass will play an important role in meeting climate change targets. I decided to chair the IAB because it’s vital that biomass is sourced sustainably and takes the latest scientific thinking into account.
John Beddington. Click image to view/download in high res.
“As the science evolves, we will make recommendations to ensure that the biomass used at Drax makes a positive contribution to our climate and the environment.”
Drax’s biomass sustainability policy draws on recommendations made by Forest Research, the research agency of the Forestry Commission, in a report commissioned by the European Climate Foundation, a philanthropic foundation.
The Forest Research report recommends 15 key criteria to deliver sustainable biomass that has the best outcome for the environment. These include favouring biomass that is associated with activities to conserve and enhance forest growth and productivity and a commitment not to take from sources that lead to deforestation.
Following the conversion of two thirds of the North Yorkshire power station to use biomass instead of coal, last year Drax reduced its carbon emissions by over 80% since 2012, making it the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and Europe’s largest decarbonisation project.
The company has plans to go further in its decarbonisation with the development of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technologies which could enable Drax to become the world’s first negative emissions power station in the 2030s.

Cruachan Visitor Centre wins 5-star award from VisitScotland
8 October 2019
Press releases

VisitScotland gave the centre, which is located at the power station on the banks of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute, the highest scores for hospitality and friendliness – elevating the centre to the top 2% of their quality assurance scheme for the first time.
Sarah Cameron, Cruachan Visitor Centre Manager said:
“We’re thrilled to be recognised among the best of the best in Scotland. Our dedicated team always go the extra mile to make sure the experience people have here is as engaging and educational as possible.
“We have around 50,000 visitors a year, and they’re often awestruck by how this power station has been built inside a mountain. The stunning scenery and wildlife – including the pine martens, which people love to watch – makes it a very special place to visit.”
Drax’s Sarah Cameron who is manager of the visitor centre.
As well as the pine martens, Cruachan is also home to swallows, ospreys and golden eagles and often attracts walkers keen to take in the stunning views.
Cruachan power station was built in the 1960s deep inside the hollowed-out Ben Cruachan mountain. More than 1,000 workers, known as the Tunnel Tigers, drilled and blasted through the rock to create the cavernous power station.
Visitors can take guided tours inside the subterranean world of the power station where they can see the machine hall and learn about its history and the feat of engineering required to build it.
The visitor centre’s interactive exhibitions and displays help bring history to life and explain how electricity is generated. There is also a café, gift shop and picnic area.
As Scotland’s national tourism organisation, VisitScotland’s quality assurance scheme helps businesses develop their standards to the highest possible level. It uses benchmarking and ‘secret shopper’ visits to assess sites.
David Adams McGilp, VisitScotland Regional Director, said:
“Our scheme is about much more than just a star rating – it is about the entire visitor experience and investing in the business to make it as economically sustainable, and profitable, as it can be.”
Drax has introduced free guided tours at the Hollow Mountain for schools and higher education institutions during term time as part of its commitment to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects and careers.
The company acquired Cruachan power station at the end of 2018, as part of its acquisition of a portfolio of flexible, renewable and low-carbon generating assets. Drax renovated the visitor centre and reopened it in February.
The visitor centre is open from 9.15am to 3.45pm in winter and 9.15am to 4.45pm in summer, Monday to Friday. The Hollow Mountain café uses produce grown at the centre’s own vegetable garden in its soups, sandwiches and salads.

Editor’s Notes
Drax Group completed
the acquisition
of a portfolio of renewable, low-carbon and flexible power stations, in strategic locations across the country – from Scotland to the South East coast – on 31
st
December 2018.
Cruachan Power Station is located on the shores of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute, western Scotland. It is one of only four pumped hydro storage stations in the UK and has a capacity of 440 MW – enough to power more than 90,000 homes.
Cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world
The turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowed-out mountain of Ben Cruachan and houses four generators.
The plant has four primary modes of operation and can deliver a range of balancing and ancillary services.
About Drax
Drax Group’s ambition is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,600-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.

Drax’s planning application to develop the latest in high efficiency gas turbine technology has been approved
4 October 2019
Press releases

Drax’s planning application to develop the latest in high efficiency gas turbine technology has been approved.
The project could enable Drax to deliver more reliable and flexible, high efficiency electricity generation at its power station in North Yorkshire – helping the UK to transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Drax must secure a capacity market agreement to underpin the investment needed to develop the first combined cycle generating unit.
If developed, 1.8GW of new capacity would be available at Drax from October 2023. This could help to displace less efficient and higher carbon emitting power stations, enabling further decarbonisation of the UK’s power system, whilst creating up to 800 jobs during construction.



Heavy loads safely delivered to iconic power station
3 October 2019
Press releases

The unusually large loads were transported separately during the night to reduce any disruption to other road users and required two short road closures on the A82 between Crianlarich and Tyndrum, as well as the temporary reinforcement of a bridge at Inverherive, to ensure it could withstand the weight.
The transformers were built for use at Cruachan but were held in long-term storage at Longannet power station, which is being decommissioned. The transformers were part of Drax’s acquisition of a portfolio of flexible, low-carbon and renewable power generating assets, which completed at the end of last year and included Cruachan power station.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax Head of Hydro, said:
“Cruachan is a vital piece of our generating portfolio as it can provide power at short notice, helping to plug the gaps when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine.
“Moving this important infrastructure to Cruachan means we have a couple of spares available on site, so we’ll be able to reduce the length of time a generating unit is out of action should a transformer require repairing, enabling us to get back up and running more quickly.”
Cruachan is one of only four pumped hydro storage stations in the UK and has a capacity of 440 MW – enough to power more than 90,000 homes at times of peak demand.
Built on the shores of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute, it was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world.
The transformers were stripped back to the core to make them lighter and able to fit under bridges. The size of the load limited driving speeds to an average of about 10 miles per hour. The units were relocated in stages over two weeks, with the moves completed on Tuesday October 1. The transformers are now being reassembled on site at Cruachan.
Driving the transformer up to Drax’s Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station.
Road closures were carried out in accordance with the requirements of local police and transport authorities, who planned the timing of the closures to cause the least inconvenience to other road users.

Editor’s Notes
Each transformer weighs 115 tonnes and measures more than 2.5 metres high. The transformer, transport trailer and tractor unit together weighed over 200 tonnes.
Cruachan became part of the Drax Group through an acquisition that completed on 31 December 2018.
The turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowed-out mountain of Ben Cruachan and houses four generators. The plant has four primary modes of operation and can deliver a range of balancing and ancillary services essential for supporting the electricity grid and maintaining secure supplies.
Cruachan acts responsively by generating electricity to meet peak-time demand. It can achieve full load in 30 seconds and can maintain its maximum power production for more than 16 hours if necessary.
Cruachan Power Station is also a popular tourist destination. Guided tours are available through the
Cruachan website
with visitors and school groups welcomed between February and mid-December.

Drax employees raise £6,500 for Macmillan Cancer Support
Press releases

People working at Drax’s offices and power stations across the country baked cakes, or bought them to raise money for the charity, whilst others took part in an annual fun run at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire.
Drax Group Chairman Phil Cox, started the 5km and 10km fun run which 70 employees took part in at the Skylark Nature Reserve next to the power station, near Selby. Each employee donated £1 per kilometre to take part in the event.
Those who opted to run the 10km course faced a climb up local landmark, Barlow Mound, which has views back over the power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire.
Hayley Adamson, Senior Biomass Portfolio Trader, completed the 5km race and was the first woman over the finishing line. She said:
“It’s great to see so many colleagues taking part in the fun run, the atmosphere’s been great – I just wish I’d completed it a bit quicker.”
Drax Group made a £2,000 charitable contribution to support the employees’ national fundraising day taking the total to £6,500 for Macmillan, which provides support and advice to cancer patients and their families.
Contractors working for Drax Power Station’s suppliers Hargreaves and Doosan Babcock also donated £1,200 towards the total raised for Macmillan Cancer Support.
Vicky Bullivant, Drax’s Head of Business Sustainability said:
“This was an outstanding Drax team effort with people right across the Group contributing to the total raised – including our contractors.
“People baked delicious cakes which were sold at a number of our offices and power stations – whilst many more of us enjoyed buying and eating them. If an army marches on its stomach then it’s probably no surprise that quite so many of our colleagues were able to complete the fun run during a morning filled with so much cake!
“We’re proud to have raised £6,500 for Macmillan, supporting the incredible work they do for so many people and we’re looking forward to organising more events over the course of the year to help raise money for charity.”

Editor’s Notes
In January Drax Group completed
the acquisition
of a portfolio of renewable, low-carbon and flexible power stations, in strategic locations across the country – from Scotland to the South East coast. This includes the pumped hydro storage facility in Cruachan and the run-of-river hydro plants in Lanark and Galloway.
Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire is the UK’s largest power station and the country’s biggest renewable electricity generator.
Since converting two thirds of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, it is producing enough renewable electricity for four million households and delivering carbon savings of more than 80%.
If Drax is able to scale up its
successful bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot
project to become the world’s first negative emissions power station, it would be reducing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the same time as producing flexible, renewable power and supporting grid stability.
