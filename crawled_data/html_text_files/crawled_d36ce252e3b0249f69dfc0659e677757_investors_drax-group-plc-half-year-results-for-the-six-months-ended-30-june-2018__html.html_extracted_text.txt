Continued growth in Pellet Production and B2B Energy Supply
Capital Markets Day, 13 November
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive of Drax Group plc, said:
“Drax continues to be at the heart of decarbonising UK energy, securing government support to convert a fourth unit to biomass and piloting a Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage project, supporting the UK Government’s carbon capture and storage ambitions.
“Full year EBITDA expectations remain unchanged. However, first half EBITDA was lower, principally due to two specific generation outages. We made excellent progress with our Pellet Production business, driving down costs while producing at record levels and our B2B Energy Supply business continues to increase customer numbers. We also remain on track with our investment projects: the conversion of a fourth unit to biomass, and the development of our OCGT and coal-to-gas repowering options.
“We remain focused on safe and efficient operations and returns to shareholders and expect to declare a full year dividend of £56 million for 2018.”
Group Financial Review
Increase to operating profit includes unrealised gains on derivative contracts of £24 million (2017: loss £86 million)
Decrease in underlying earnings per share – principally reflects lower EBITDA from biomass generation in H1 2018 vs H1 2017
Reported basic earnings per share – a loss of 1.0 pence, which includes write off of coal-specific assets (£27 million) following commencement of fourth biomass unit conversion, largely offset by unrealised gains on derivative contracts (£24 million)
Tax – tax credit reflecting benefit of Patent Box claims
Capital investment of £46 million, full year investment expectation unchanged at £100–£110 million
Core maintenance (£50 million), improvement and optimisation projects (£20-£30 million) and conversion of a fourth biomass unit (£30 million)
Net debt of £366 million (31 Dec 2017: £367 million), including cash on hand of £245 million
