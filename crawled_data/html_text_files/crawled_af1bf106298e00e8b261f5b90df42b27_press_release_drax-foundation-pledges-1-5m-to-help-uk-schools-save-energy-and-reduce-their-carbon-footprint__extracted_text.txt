renewable energy company drax group has committed 15 million this year to help schools install energyefficient led lights and solar panels and deliver energy saving monitoring and education 17 july 2023 the firm which owns drax power station near selby established the drax foundation earlier this year to provide grant funding to nonprofit organisations in the regions where it operates the installation of energyefficient led lighting initiative is currently being piloted at the following five schools local to draxs operations in england barwic parade community primary school in selby kirk sandall junior school in doncaster selby abbey primary school triangle primary school in sowerby bridge great clacton junior school in clactononsea it is estimated that these schools will save on average 8600 per year from reduced energy bills which can then be reinvested back into the school and childrens education the full rollout of the led lighting and solar panel schemes and energy saving and education programme is planned for later this year with a focus on rural communities and areas of low social mobility particularly in and around the communities where drax operates schools wishing to submit an expression of interest should contact email protected will gardiner ceo drax group said the drax foundation is committed to giving back to the communities where we operate and the new initiative will provide schools with practical tangible ways to save money and reduce their carbon footprint its important that children start thinking about these issues from a young age as energy usage and its impact is set to become an increasingly relevant topic in their future kathy thompson executive headteacher at kirk sandall junior school said its so important that businesses support their communities and this initiative by the drax foundation is a really great way to help us save money especially at the moment when energy costs and prices in general are so high it also teaches pupils about the impact we have on our environment and how we can act responsibly to save energy the drax foundation was launched in march this year to award grants of up to 50000 for established nonprofit organizations organisations and initiatives that meet draxs funding and selection criteria are encouraged to visit wwwdraxcomcommunity to learn more about the foundation and submit an

instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the
