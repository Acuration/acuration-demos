Drax Repower project application accepted by Planning Inspectorate for examination
Application an important step to develop new gas-fired generation and battery storage.
26 June 2018
Drax Power Station’s application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for its Repower gas generation and battery storage project has been accepted for examination by the Planning Inspectorate.
Plans to replace Drax’s remaining coal generating units with up to 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of high efficiency gas-fired power generation and up to 200 megawatts (MW) of battery storage were first set out in September 2017.
Since then the company has been developing engineering and environmental reports for the application, as well as carrying out an extensive consultation programme with local people, landowners, councils and authorities.
The proposals will now be examined by an independent planning inspector before being considered by the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) with a decision expected in 2019.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“I am delighted that the Planning Inspectorate has accepted our application for examination. This is an important milestone for the Repower project and takes us a step closer towards securing the future of the power station.
“With our gas Repower plans and the conversion of a fourth generating unit this summer to use biomass instead of coal, we intend to extend the life of the plant, protect jobs and deliver the flexible and reliable power millions of households and businesses need.
“By upgrading and reusing some of our existing infrastructure to use gas, we will be able to provide more capacity, stability and essential grid services cost effectively, and deliver the government’s commitment to end power generation with unabated coal by 2025.”
“We are committed to involving our local communities in our Repower plans and look forward to engaging with all interested parties over the coming months as the planning process progresses.”
Drax is already the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator having converted three coal generating units to use sustainable wood pellets, with the fourth set for this summer. More than two thirds of the power produced is now renewable, providing 15% of the UK’s renewable electricity – enough for four million homes.

Editor’s Notes
The planning process for the DCO is as follows:
Now the Repower application has been accepted for examination, Drax will notify local authorities, landowners and other statutory consultees and they will receive a copy of the accepted application documents.
In addition, a notice will be published at or near the Repower site and in relevant newspapers to publicise the accepted application. This notice will provide information to local people on where they can review the application and how and when they can make representations to the Planning Inspectorate.
Anyone who makes a representation can register to become an ‘Interested Party’ once the examination process starts.
If the application is accepted, the Planning Inspectorate will appoint an independent inspector known as an ‘Examining Authority’ to oversee the examination of the application, a process that is likely to start in the autumn.
A preliminary meeting with Interested Parties, Drax and the Examining Authority will be held to coincide with the start of the examination process. Interested parties will be given at least 21 days’ notice of the meeting. At this meeting, the Examining Authority will inform Drax and Interested Parties of the examination procedure and schedule going forward.
The post-application and examination processes, including the formal notification of the accepted application and the consultation on the Application documents (undertaken in accordance with Section 56 of the Planning Act 2008), are defined by relevant regulations and the Planning Inspectorate.
Anyone with questions about the process can contact Drax Repower team via email at
[email protected]
or by calling the Freephone number: 0800 731 8250 or by writing to them at FREEPOST DRAX REPOWER.
