Public exhibitions about Drax Repower held, consultation period remains open until 27th February
7 February 2018
Press releases

The final public exhibitions about the Drax Repower project were held last week in Selby and Hemingbrough but people still have until 27
th
February to consider the Project’s Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) and share their feedback with Drax.
Over the past fortnight, five exhibitions have been held in the local area. The project team has also recently met Selby District councillors and representatives of the parish councils that are local to Drax Power Station.
The public exhibitions explained the main elements of the Repower project, the need for it to be built, the main points from the PEIR and the various studies that Drax and its project team has undertaken over recent months.  The exhibitions also showed visitors what the Repower project could look like from different viewpoints, including two possible routes for the c. 3km underground pipeline that would connect the power station to the national gas grid.  135 people visited the exhibitions and spoke with members of the project team.
The exhibition boards, alongside a leaflet about the Project scheme, the PEIR, a Project Overview document and the Project’s Statement of Community Consultation can be found in the
document section
of our website. The suite of documents can also be viewed at Access Selby, County Hall in Northallerton and East Riding of Yorkshire’s Customer Service Centre in Beverley.  The libraries in Selby, Snaith and Goole also host these documents.
Gathering local feedback to the Repower Project is an important part of the planning process, and people have until 5.00pm on February 27
th
to provide their feedback. They can do this via the project website, by email to
[email protected]
or by writing to us at FREEPOST DRAX REPOWER.
Whilst the statutory period of consultation remains open till the end of this month, the Project team is continuing its engineering and environmental studies.  The team will also consider the feedback that it receives from local people, local councils and various other organisations. The feedback will help inform the final designs of the project.
Currently, Drax is aiming to finalise and submit its application to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy within the next 3-4 months.  A final decision from the Secretary of State, after an independent examination period, could be expected in the second half of 2019.
We will issue Information Updates as the project moves forward.



Drax Power CEO Andy Koss responds to Skipton to Colne rail route announcement
3 February 2018


Uncategorized


Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“Re-opening the Skipton to Colne route to rail freight as well as passenger travel would have a significant impact for business across the North of England, slashing travel times and increasing productivity in the process.
“It will have a direct impact on improving our supply chain at Drax, allowing freight trains to travel much more quickly to the power station in North Yorkshire – reducing journey times from the Port of Liverpool to less than three hours, a journey which can take up to nine hours at the moment.
“As a nation we can benefit from a fast, efficient railway that allows more free movement of goods between manufacturers, their distribution hubs and their markets across the north of England and beyond.”

Kick start a career in engineering at Drax
16 January 2018


Uncategorized


Budding engineers can apply for an apprenticeship at Drax through its Technical Apprenticeship Scheme which is now open.
The scheme offers successful candidates the chance to learn a trade, develop new skills and launch their career in engineering at the UK’s biggest power station and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Having upgraded half of the power station from coal to use renewable biomass, nearly 70% of the power produced at Drax Power Station, is now renewable – enough for four million households.
Drax is looking for six technical craft apprentices who will be trained in engineering to work within the maintenance department at Drax Power Station. They will work on new and recently upgraded plant designed to process renewable fuels and the maintenance of the power station.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“For anyone wanting to start their career in engineering, it doesn’t get much better than learning their trade at the UK’s biggest power station.
“It’s an exciting time to join Drax – as well as having upgraded half of the power station to use sustainable biomass, we’re also developing four rapid response gas power projects, exploring options for repowering two of our remaining coal generating units to gas and developing large-scale battery storage.”
He added: “An apprenticeship is a brilliant way to start a career in engineering. We’ve got lots of successful former apprentices working at Drax Power Station – there are engineers, section heads and department managers who all started out as apprentices.
“In order to attract the best people for the roles we hope to appeal to a diverse range of candidates from all backgrounds and would encourage anyone with an interest to apply.”
Tom Glennon-Fell, a third year technical apprentice based at Drax Power Station said: “The Drax Apprenticeship Scheme has given me the best chance to go far and be successful in my career by learning and getting hands on experience at Drax.
“I’m in my third year as an apprentice and really enjoy the variety of work I do, on a day to day basis working with some of the most experienced and knowledgeable people in the power sector.”
The Drax Apprenticeship Training Scheme is a four year programme, with each apprentice spending the first two years training in Loughborough, where travel and accommodation is provided.
In the third and fourth years, apprentices will be primarily based at Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire with places available in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.
Applications for the Technical Apprenticeship Scheme in 2018 are now being accepted and will close on 31
st
January 2018.
Drax will also be offering other apprenticeships over the course of the year in business support areas, such as Finance and Business Administration. All opportunities are advertised on the website at

More local events to discuss gas and battery project
11 January 2018
Press releases

https:////repower.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Drax-Repower-project-3D-model-no-logo-1.mp4
More events are being held to ensure local people have their say about Drax Power Station’s plans to repower up to two of its remaining coal-fired electricity generating units with gas and install what could be amongst the largest batteries in the world.
Drax’s project team will be on hand at the events to discuss the plans with local people and listen to their views.  New images and interactive displays showing what the development will include, as well as an environmental impact report, will also be available.
If the plans go ahead in their entirety, the development would include two combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) which would also be capable of operating as rapid response gas power plants in open-cycle mode, with a combined capacity of up to 3,600 megawatts (MW) of electricity as well as battery storage of up to 200MW.
The exhibitions follow on from similar events held in November and are part of the statutory consultation process required ahead of submitting an application for a Development Consent Order.
Andy Koss, Chief Executive of Drax Power, said:
“Holding public events to share our ideas with local people is a great way to hear their views. It’s really important to us that we support and work with our local communities – we want people who live and work in the area near the power station to play a part in shaping our thinking for the future. We look forward to sharing our ideas and hearing thoughts.
“The options we’re exploring could reuse some of the existing infrastructure from the remaining coal assets at Drax and extend their operation as gas plant into the 2030s. The Repower project could secure the future of the power station beyond 2025 when the government says coal must come off the system.
“Drax Power Station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the North of England, generating more than £1/2bn for the northern economy and supporting 6,000 jobs.”
Drax is already the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator having converted three coal generating units to use sustainable wood pellets. More than two thirds of the power produced is now renewable, providing 17% of the UK’s renewable electricity – enough for four million homes.
Mr Koss explained that by upgrading its existing infrastructure to use gas it would provide more capacity, stability and essential grid services keeping costs low for consumers and delivering the government’s commitment to end power generation with unabated coal by 2025.
Public exhibitions featuring Drax’s proposals are taking place at the following venues:
Selby Town Hall,
York Street, Selby, YO8 4AJ – Saturday 20

About the planning regime
The proposed development is a nationally significant infrastructure project (NSIP) under “the construction or extension of a generating station” category in Part 3 Sections 14(1)(a) and 15(2) of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended). As such, Drax is required to seek planning permission known as a Development Consent Order (DCO) from the Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.
About the Repower Project
Drax’s proposals include the following elements:
Up to 3,600 megawatts (MW) of new gas generation capacity and up to 200MW of battery storage – two battery storage facilities, one per unit and each up to 100MW
The capacity of the Drax’s coal units being considered for this project is 1,290MW.
Gas-fired generation units (four new turbines, up to two per unit) that can operate in combined-cycle or open-cycle modes.
Use of existing steam turbines and cooling towers.
A new gas pipeline connection to the National Gas Transmission System and an electrical connection into Drax’s existing substation to allow electricity to be exported to the National Grid.
An option to install a temporary crane positioned next to the existing jetty on the River Ouse and at a point close to the power station during construction.
Environmental assessments are considering issues such as local planning, air and water quality, flood risk, traffic and transport, noise, ecology, heritage and the effects on landscape and visual amenity.

Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner responds to unabated coal closure consultation
5 January 2018


Uncategorized


Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“It’s great to have further clarity from the government about the future for coal and we look forward to working with them and helping to achieve this goal of making the power sector coal free in 2025.
“As we’ve said before, coal doesn’t have a long term role to play in a low carbon future.
We’ve already seen a dramatic fall in power generation from coal – an 84% reduction in the last five years, and a major shift towards lower carbon technologies. At Drax we’re exploring options for repowering our remaining coal units to use sustainable biomass and gas.”



Local people to be consulted on plans for gas-fired power station
2 January 2018
Press releases

The proposed Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) power station would produce up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of about 150,000 homes.
It is intended to be able to be up and running quickly to provide back-up power to the National Grid during periods of peak demand, to support the growing number of renewable and low carbon energy sources.
As a rapid response and flexible power station it would not be operational all the time – it would be producing power for up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in a given year.
The development will contribute millions of pounds of investment into the local economy, create up to 15 full time skilled jobs once operational, and up to 150 jobs during the two-year construction period.
Local people were originally consulted on proposals for the power station in 2014, but the project was put on hold in 2015 due to market uncertainty. The project is now under the new ownership of the British energy company, Drax Group plc, and is once again being taken forward.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said: “As a result of what was learned during the consultation undertaken in 2014 and other studies, we have made a number of changes to the original proposals. For example, the cable for the electrical connection has been put underground instead of having an overhead line; we have selected an access route from the B4489 to the west of the site, and reduced the number of stacks from five to one.
“We are looking forward to sharing our latest plans at the public exhibitions next month and hearing what local people think about them before we finalise the scheme and submit a Development Consent Order application.”
Abergelli Power Limited is holding public consultation events from 7 February 2018 to 10 February 2018 at Lllangyfelach, Clydach, Tircoed and Felindre. Members of the project team will be on hand to discuss the proposals and consultation process.
The consultation will run from 16 January 2018 until 19 February 2018 and full information about the project, the public exhibitions and the preliminary findings of the environmental impact assessments will be available online on Abergelli Power
here
.
As the capacity of the power station is over 50 MW, the scheme is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, which means a Development Consent Order application will need to be submitted to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, who will make a decision on whether to give the plans the go ahead.
Subject to the public consultation, planning process and market conditions, the power station could be operational in 2022.
