Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
“In the first half of 2023, we delivered a strong system support and generation performance, providing dispatchable, renewable power for millions of UK homes and businesses. Drax Power Station remained the UK’s single largest provider of renewable energy by output during the period.
“We continue to focus on our role as the UK’s leading generator of flexible renewable power and our ambition to be a world leader in carbon removals. To that end, in the US, we have made good progress screening options for BECCS projects which can deliver long-term, large-scale carbon removal and attractive opportunities for growth.
“We are excited about the opportunity for BECCS in the UK and are in formal discussions with the UK Government to facilitate the transition to BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030. Our plans could create thousands of new jobs in the Humber region, help the UK meet its carbon removals targets and support long-term energy security.”

(1)
Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (revaluation of deferred tax balances reflecting future increases in UK corporation tax rates, acquisition costs, restructuring costs and certain asset obsolescence charges and impairments), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS measures exclude earnings from associates and amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, other gains and losses and impairment of non-current assets, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements, earnings from associates and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
(3)
In December 2022, the UK Government confirmed the details of a windfall tax – the Electricity Generator Levy (or EGL) – on renewable and low-carbon generators, due for implementation in 2023 and running to 31 March 2028. The levy applies to the three biomass units operating under the Renewables Obligation (RO) scheme and our run-of-river hydro operations. It does not apply to the Contract for Difference (CfD) biomass or pumped storage hydro units. Following review, we have concluded that EGL will be accounted for as a levy within Gross Profit and therefore Adjusted EBITDA. For the remainder of 2023 we will present Adjusted EBITDA including and excluding EGL for ease of comparison.
(4)
Borrowings including the impact of hedging instruments less cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(5)
In May 2023 the Group commenced a £150 million share buy-back. The programme is ongoing and has to date purchased 21 million shares (£122 million).
(6)
As of 21 July 2023, analyst consensus for 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was £1,172 million, with a range of £1,100 – 1,203 million. The details of this company collected consensus are displayed on the Group’s website. https://www.drax.com/investors/announcements-events-reports/presentations/
(7)
Q2 2022 to Q1 2023.
(8)
Includes structured power sales (forward gas sales as a proxy for forward power), transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to forward power prices. 2024: 0.4TWh, 2025: 1.5TWh, presented net of cost of closing out gas positions at maturity and replacing with forward power sales.
(9)
Incrementally lower in 2023 due to major planned outages on two ROC units.
(10)
2023 includes forward selling of pumped storage generation resulting in higher captured prices but lower system support availability.
