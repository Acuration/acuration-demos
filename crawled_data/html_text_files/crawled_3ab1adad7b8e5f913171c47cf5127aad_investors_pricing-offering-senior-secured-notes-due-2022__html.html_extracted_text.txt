Drax Group PLC
(Symbol: DRX)
Drax Group plc’s (“Drax”) indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Drax Finco plc, has today priced its offering of £350 millionsenior secured fixed rate notes due 2022 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and £200 million senior secured floating rate notes due 2022 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Notes”).
The Fixed Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.25 per cent. per annum and will be issued at 100 per cent. of their nominal value.

The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 3 month LIBOR (subject to a zero per cent. floor) plus 4.0 per cent. per annum and will be issued at 100 per cent. of their nominal value.
The proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand will be used as part of a refinancing of Drax’s existing debt.
An amendment to the current £400 million credit facility is also expected to become effective on or around 5 May. Under the amendment, an aggregate principal amount of £350 million will be made available to Drax Corporate Limited. It is expected that approximately £35 million will be drawn at closing.
Drax has also extended its existing commodity trading facility, to include gas related commodity trades in addition to the existing power and dark green spread facility. The extension of the commodity trading facility allows Drax to transact prescribed volumes of trades without the requirement to post collateral.
