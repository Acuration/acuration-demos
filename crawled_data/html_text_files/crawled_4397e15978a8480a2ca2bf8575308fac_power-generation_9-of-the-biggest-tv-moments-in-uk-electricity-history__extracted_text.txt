950mw as more people reached for light switches how do we deal with tv pickups national grid electricty pylon at sunrise because the level of electricity needed to power the country cant be stored when there is a spike in demand it needs to be met quickly by a similar increase in real time generation to manage the supply and demand for events likely to cause electricity surges the national grid forecasts electricity need for large events like world cups and major tv events the grid can then put contingency measures in place to manage the huge changes in demand in real time it does this through a suite of tools called balancing mechanisms which allows it to access sources of extra power in realtime the rise of more energy efficient home appliances and ondemand streaming means that the shape of electricity demand has become flatter since the days when most of the country was tuned into the same mustsee moments however its still crucial for the grid to forecast periods of high demand when it will keep the necessary power stations on reserve ready to deliver additional electricity if needed if it wasnt for this careful management of electricity by the grid and the power stations like drax supplying it that cup of tea next time england crash out of a major sporting event would not only be tainted with disappointment but cold too share most read electrification storage
