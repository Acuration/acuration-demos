electric vehicles evs can electricity power heavyduty vehicles 3 january 2018 electrification on a blackedout stage a blast of white light appears smoke floods out music blares and an excited crowd surges forward smartphones held aloft its a moment of rapture  but this is not a theatrical or musical performance this is the launch of an electric car specifically the launch of teslas new electric roadster  which claims to be the fastest production car ever made and while the sportscar may have been the undoubted star of the event it wasnt the only one unveiled tesla also launched an electricpowered articulated lorry  the semi with governments around the world setting ambitious plans to ban the sale of petrolanddieselonly cars  the introduction of electricpowered utility vehicles  like teslas truck  in a range of industries will be essential to a truly decarbonised transport system disrupting trucking teslas heavy goods vehicle hgv highlights the growing capabilities of electric vehicles evs to deliver more than just short urban journeys it claims its semi will be able to travel 500 miles on a single charge enough to get you from london to edinburgh comfortably and tow 40 tonnes of cargo tesla isnt the only player with electric big rig concepts  los angelesbased thor trucks  daimler and volkswagen have unveiled their own  but its ambitious 2019 production target makes it a more immediate possibility than any other in the space despite media coverage claiming the semis megacharging capability breaks the laws of physics  big business is taking a sunny view of elon musks latest innovation walmart which has been taking strides to reduce its emissions has already preordered 15 of the semis  delivery firm ups has used small electric trucks in major cities for some years already  it has placed the largest order so far for 125  electrifying emergency response in the world of emergency services quick response is vital evs then which have fast acceleration and are quick off the mark are ideal candidates to deliver  especially as battery technology becomes more reliable and durable health services in nottingham have already been trialling electricpowered fast response vehicles while in japan nissan has unveiled an allelectric ambulance that carries a lithiumion auxiliary battery to power medical equipment on board this onboard power supply is a further advantage of evs and one not just restricted to emergency services electric pickup truck maker havelaar for example offers power outlets on its bison vehicle for electric tools the future of battery farming out in the countryside evs are making waves in farming john deere has unveiled plans for fully electric tractors claiming they require less maintenance and have a longer lifecycle than combustion engines  with more than a third of uk farms generating their own power from solar wind and even anaerobic digestion using farm byproducts theres potential for farmers to charge tractors renewably and cut their fuel and charging costs more than just helping cut emissions and costs there can also be performance benefits given their acceleration abilities electric tractors are well suited to heavy pulling without revving up engines and churning up ground joining hgvs and tractors in their ability to apply almost instant torque to heavy industrial jobs are edumper trucks the komatsu quarry truck weighs in at almost 45 tonnes and claims to be the biggest ev in the world the economic advantage of electrification air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are the main driving force behind many antifossil fuel regulations however research suggests decarbonising transport systems also have economic advantages for businesses a report by financial services firm hitachi capital found that switching vans and heavy goods vehicles hgvs to electric or other alternative fuels could save british businesses as much as 14 billion a year it claims evs run at 13p cheaper per mile than dieselfuelled vans while hgvs are reported to be 38p cheaper that adds up to total savings of 137 billion a year if all britains commercial vehicles were switched the move to a fully electrified transport system is already underway the number of registered electric cars increased by 280 in the uk over the past four years according to the hitachi report the chinese city of shenzhens entire fleet of 16359 buses has gone electric  a transition that began in 2009 and has been assisted by an 80 drop in the cost of a lithiumion battery pack according to bloomberg new energy finance  chinas need for electric bus batteries is almost on a par to that of all global ev battery demand china could be said to be driving the market evs are undoubtedly cleaner when it comes to roadside pollution however the exponential increase in evs will only benefit the fight against man made climate change if countries entire energy systems continue to decarbonise  emissionsfree vehicles will need to be powered predominantly by low carbon electricity for a more electric future to be a sustainable one tags electric vehicles evs  investors  technology every electricity storage technology you need to know about 24 november 2017 power generation the world is generating and using more renewable electricity than ever before but in many cases it is being generated by intermittent  weather dependent  sources like solar and wind while these are imperative to a decarbonised future they cant generate power all the time and this can cause gaps in electricity supply one possible solution is storage if we can store renewable electricity from intermittent sources when they are able to generate it could then be utilised at times when theyre not however the problem is the technology capable of storing electricity at a scale large enough to power a city doesnt existyet the race to develop it is well under way and several companies are working on building ever bigger more efficient electricity storage methods from pumping water up mountains to turning air into liquid here are the emerging storage technologies and some incumbent ones shaping the storage landscape pumped hydropower what if we could power cities with something as simple as gravity and a mountain pumped hydropower storage uses excess electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to a higher one for example up a mountain or hill where it is stored when electricity is needed the water is released from the higher reservoir and runs down the natural incline passing through a typical hydropower turbine to generate electricity pumped hydro is one of the largestcapacity forms of grid power storage and currently accounts for 99 of all bulk storage globally  the bath county pumped storage station in virginia usa is often referred to as the worlds biggest battery and boasts a generation capacity of more than 3 gigawatts gw  which is almost as much as the power output of drax power station or hinkley point c so whats the catch while pumpedhydro storage is efficient and capable of holding huge capacity its major drawback is it requires a suitable mountain or hill to be converted into a giant battery unsurprisingly not every landscape offers one great britain has limited potential  but has a number of pumped storage facilities including the impressive dinorwig in the snowdonia region of wales known as the electric mountain which like drax doubles up as a tourist attraction in december 2018 drax bought cruachan power station the second biggest pumpedhydro storage power station in great britain visit cruachan  the hollow mountain  flywheels and supercapacitors some of the mostrapidly responding forms of energy storage flywheel and supercapacitor storage can both discharge and recharge faster than most conventional forms of batteries the first works by spinning a rotor or flywheel to very high speeds using electrical energy this process creates kinetic energy which is effectively stored within the spinning rotor until its required at which point the kinetic energy is converted back into electricity supercapacitors take a similar approach but store power electrically with the combined properties of a battery and a capacitor they store energy as a static charge but unlike conventional batteries there is no chemical reaction during charging or discharging lithiumion batteries lithiumion batteries are already the goto power source for most home electronics thanks to their highenergy density and low selfdischarge rates but companies are looking to extend their usage by rapidly advancing the technology to take on bigger and better uses most notably electric vehicles evs and providing security of supply to national and regional electricity networks in south australia tesla has just finished installing the worlds biggest lithiumion battery facility  at 100 megawatts mw it will be able to supply 30000 homes for an hour such as when the wind drops and the turbines of the wind farm it is connected to are not producing much power lithiumion batteries are now the most widely used in evs but manufacturers are still facing the challenge of lowering the cost of their manufacture to a point at which to make evs widely accessible tesla has made achieving this a priority establishing its massive gigafactory in nevada to help ramp up production and drop the batteries price a true breakthrough on this point is yet to be reached however solid state batteries the primary complaint for most domestic batteries today be they in smartphones or evs is they just dont last long enough this is where solidstate batteries have a serious advantage using solid electrodes and electrolytes rather than liquid electrolytes used in most commercial batteries solidstate models are smaller cheaper and have a greater energy density than lithiumion batteries they can also be recharged much faster and emit less heat in an ev this can lead to better efficiency lower costs and safer operation the only trouble is the technology isnt quite viable at scale yet dyson and toyota are both putting serious money behind the technology and believe it will be on the market in 2020 hydrogen fuel cells hydrogen is one of the mostabundant elements on earth so its an attractive fuel for any powergeneration technology the latest to emerge is hydrogen fuel cells which are quickly growing in popularity in the automotive space the fuel cells work similarly to batteries with two electrodes separated by an electrolyte however rather than running down and needing recharging hydrogen fuel cells can continue to produce electricity so long as a constant supply of hydrogen and an oxidizer are pumped through it this means a regular supply of hydrogen needs to be fed in to continue to generate power  prompting the rise of fuelling stations where hydrogenpowered cars can be filled up with hydrogen when their batteries have run dry beyond powering cars hydrogen fuel cells have also been used to power buildings and nasa satellites  vehicletogrid systems but what if beyond simply using electricity evs could themselves act as energy storage systems between journeys all cars spend long periods of time stationary vehicletogrid v2g systems can take advantage of this and give evs the ability to discharge their stored electricity for distribution across the grid helping meet demand during peak times in effect cars can become mini power plants nissan and italian energy provider enel have already advanced plans for this sort of system and aim to install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk  evs plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary drax too is involved in this space funding research into v2g systems at sheffield university  smart charging systems will help to automate this giveandtake of electricity further and allow evs to further help reduce overall carbon emissions  compressed air energy compressed air energy storage works similarly to pumped hydropower but instead of pushing water uphill excess electricity is used to compress and store energy underground when electricity is needed the pressurised air is heated which causes it to expand and released driving a turbine behind pumped hydroenergy compressed air is the secondlargest form of energy storage  and is continuously being developed to become more efficient and less dependent on fossil fuels to heat air and similarly to pumped hydro its a sitespecific means of storage compressed air is normally best stored in existing geological formations such as disused hard rock or old salt mines leadacid batteries their technology might be a century and a half old but leadacid batteries are still used today for the simple reason that they still work many decades of development mean leadacid batteries are cheap to produce and highly reliable compared to new innovations in the space today they are most commonly used as car batteries but they have also long served as offgrid storage for solar arrays  their drawbacks include the toxic nature of the chemicals involved and the short lifespan of 300 to 500 cycles however recycling programmes around these leadacid batteries have been so effective that 99 of the batteries in the us were recycled between 2009 and 2013  while moreefficient longer lasting faster charging and lighter batteries are in development leadacid models remain the cheap triedandtested standard for smallscale storage redox flow batteries specifically focusing on renewable energy storage flow batteries are significantly cheaper than lithiumion gridscale storage and offer a longer lifecycle flow batteries consist of two tanks of liquids that are pumped into a reactor where they generate a charge the capacity of the storage facility is therefore determined by the size of the tanks holding their respective liquids which can mean they are bulky and space intensive compared to other gridscale storage systems however flow batteries are more economical suffer lower vulnerabilities and could hold potential to store large amounts of energy for long periods of time  one of the reasons why drax is funding a phd in the area liquid oxygen plant tanks and heat exchange coils the background a factory liquefied air what more abundant resource to use for energy storage than the air around us by cooling air down to 196 o c it is turned into a compressed liquid which can be stored when ambient air is exposed to this liquid it regasifies and expands in volume rapidly rotating a turbine in the process one of the main advantages of this form of storage is its potentially high capacity  an impressive 700 litres of ambient air can be reduced to just one litre of liquid air more than this there is potential for it to become even more efficient by using waste heat and cold from industrial process such as thermal generation plants steel milling or the creation of liquefied natural gas lng uk company highview power storage is currently trialling the technology at the piliswoth landfill gas generation facility where it will provide energy storage as well as convert lowgrade waste heat to power want to find out more keep an eye on the drax repower project which includes plans for up to 200 mw of storage  and imperial college londons grantham institute on climate change and the environment produced this detailed infographic comparing the benefits and challenges faced by energy storage technologies  tags electric vehicles evs  energy storage  electricity how electric vehicles will impact global power demand 1 october 2017 electrification the future of cars is electric globally governments are laying out plans to ban the sale of petrol and dieselpowered cars  while the falling prices of batteries will serve to make the vehicles more affordable to consumers and more profitable for manufacturers a recent report by bloomberg increased its earlier 2016 forecast for electric vehicle ev adoption it now estimates that by 2040 54 of new car sales and 33 of the global car fleet will be electric  this vision of the future points to considerably better air quality in urban and roadside environments across the world but while evs emit none of the tailpipe fumes of traditional fossil fuelpowered cars there is still potential for associated emissions depending on how that electricity is generated for example if the growing demand caused by evs is met with fossil fuels then welltowheel emissions are still in play however as electricity grids decarbonise and become smarter and more efficient evs will become cleaner researchers at imperial college london have shown that in the uk yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to cleaner electricity generation  what this greater reliance on electricity for transport will certainly do however is massively drive up global power demand investment will be needed not only in electricity generation but also in smart technology that can allow the charging and eventually usage of evs to be managed efficiently the growing demand of evs the bloomberg report states global electricity consumption from evs is expected to grow from just 6 twh in 2016 to 1800 twh by 2040 while the figure represents a massive increase in the electricity required to power evs 1800 twh represents just 5 of the projected global power consumption in 2040 by comparison the uk as a whole consumed just 304 twh of electricity in 2016 this clearly highlights the widespread need for global investment in electricity generation on the whole beyond just what will be required to power evs however the unique challenge evs pose is less how they recharge but when they will recharge smoothing spikes assuming supporting infrastructure and technology progress to enable widespread onstreet and home charging then the demand for electricity to charge evs will mostly likely come in the evening this could result in additional pressure being placed on energy generators and national grids due to mass ev charging utilities and regulators will need to implement policies to encourage offpeak charging for example overnight and spread out the demand from evs one way these spikes will be managed is through timeofuse rates to encourage drivers to charge their vehicles at offpeak times to avoid higher electricity bills however technological improvements will also help to manage the demand evs place on energy systems  tech solutions smart charging tech is one of the most important aspects of this in allowing cities utilities and consumers to automate vehicle charging at times when overall demand is lower storage technology will also play a key role in managing increasing demand on both consumer and operator ends adoption of home power storage systems is expected to grow as fast as solar photovoltaic energy has in recent years  which will enable consumers with home solar arrays to store energy and charge vehicles at times to avoid peakhour charges on the supplier end advancement in storage technology will allow generators to deliver electricity above their usual capacity and meet spikes in demand autonomous vehicles while the report suggests autonomous vehicles will not have a significant impact over the next decade the longerterm influence of selfdriving vehicles will have direct consequences on demand autonomous cars will be able to drive in a way that is significantly more efficient than humans by driving closer together and interacting with the surrounding city to prevent congestion with widespread adoption this greater efficiency would mean cars would use less energy and require less time to recharge however ownership of these types of vehicles will likely be shared particularity in urban environments resulting in fewer overall cars on the roads and ultimately plateauing or even declining demand from evs in the 2040s and beyond globally investment is needed to meet and support the growth of evs over the next two decades governments and businesses must begin to roll out charging infrastructure and clean energy solutions to meet future demand as well as the smart city technology that will enable the mass adoption and eventual automation of evs tags electric vehicles evs  investors do electric vehicles actually reduce carbon emissions 19 august 2017 electrification electric vehicles evs are often seen as a key driver towards a greener future indeed transport accounts for roughly a quarter of the uks greenhouse gas emissions and seriously affects air quality in major cities to tackle pollution problems governments around the world are implementing ambitious policies to promote the electrification of transport and phase out ice internal combustion engine vehicles the uk and france both plan to ban the sale of petrol and dieselonly cars by 2040 while india is setting an even more ambitious end date of 2030  added to this are evs growing popularity with drivers there are now almost 110000 electric cars and vans on uk roads spurred on by lowering battery costs and a growing range of models including plugin hybrid vehicles evs now account for 2 of new registrations switching to evs is an obvious way to massively cut pollution in areas of dense traffic but the question remains  how clean are evs on the broader scale when you look at the electricity used to charge them electric vehicles are getting cleaner evs dont give off the same exhaust emissions as engines but the power in their batteries has to come from somewhere follow the flow back from the car through the charging point all the way back to the power station and its likely some of that electricity is coming from fossil fuels and that means emissions they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell a researcher at imperial college london and author of electric insights  a study commissioned by drax that analyses electricity generation data in britain now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk evs are delivering much better results he continues in fact yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to greener electricity generation today they are twice as efficient as conventional cars take the tesla model s in the winter of 2012 producing the electricity for a full charge created 124g of carbon emissions per km driven roughly the same as a 2l range rover evoque now the carbon intensity of charging a tesla has nearly halved to 74gkm in winter and 41 gkm in summer as the uk continues to break its own renewable energy records for smaller evs the results are even better the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can now be charged for less than half the co 2 of even the cleanest nonplugin ev the toyota prius hybrid so the current outlook for evs is hugely positive  but as their numbers continue to increase will the demand they add to the grid put their clean credentials at risk will evs accelerate electricity demand the national grid suggests there could be as many as nine million evs on uk roads by 2030 which could lead to an additional 410 gw of demand on the system at peak times  this in some cases could lead to a rise in emissions electricity demand in britain typically peaks between 6pm and 10pm when people arrive home and switch on lights and appliances if you were to charge your ev between those evening hours the emissions would be 8 higher than reported in the chart above if you charged between midnight and 6am they would be 10 lower today this demand is met by the existing mix of power stations which last quarter included more than 50 renewable and lowcarbon sources  but when there are sudden spikes in demand above this typical usage the national grid must call in the help of carbonintensive reserve generators such as coalpowered stations polluting diesel generators are also on standby around the uk ready to turn on and feed into regional distribution grids at a moments notice to meet the challenge of peaktime ev charging less carbon intensive power generation storage and smart power management systems are needed these include rapid response gas power stations such as the four drax ocgts planned to come online in the early 2020s as well as gridscale batteries homebased batteries and demandside response schemes as the share of intermittent renewable capacity on the grid increases more backup power needs to be available for when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine keeping our future fuels clean a future increasingly relying on backup generators is far from inevitable especially if the use of smart technology and smart meters increases by analysing electricity costs and countrywide demand smart meters have the potential to ensure evs only charge outside peak times unless absolutely necessary when electricity is more likely to come from renewable or lowcarbon and cheaper sources if the grid continues to decarbonise through advances in renewable technologies and lowercost coaltobiomass conversions the potential of evs electricity coming with associated emissions is diminished even further there is no doubt that evs will make up a significant part in the future of our mobility that they will also play a part in the future of cleaning up that mobility is as good as assured but on this journey its imperative we keep our eyes on the road commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags electric vehicles evs  decarbonisation  investors  electric insights power and the rise of electric cars 12 december 2016 electrification all great technological innovations need infrastructure to match the world didnt change from candles to lightbulbs overnight  power stations had to be built electricity cables rolled out and buildings fitted with wiring the same is true of electric vehicles ev think of the number of petrol stations lining the uk roads if evs continue their rise in popularity the country will need electric carcharging facilities to augment and then replace these petrol stations this could mean big extensions of electricity grid infrastructure both in the building of new power generation capacity to meet demand and in the extension of the networks themselves in short it could mean a significant change in how electricity is used and supplied the need for better electricity infrastructure in 2013 only 3500 of newly registered cars in the uk were plugin electric or hybrid evs in 2016 that number jumped to 63000 their use is rising rapidly but the lack of infrastructure has kept a cap on the number of evs on uk roads that is starting to change as of 2019 all new and refurbished houses in the eu will have to be fitted with an electric car charging point  according to a draft directive announced by brussels the uk will probably no longer be an eu member by the time the directive comes into effect but nevertheless the uk government is pursuing its own ways to account for the rise of evs it has pledged more than 600 million between 2015 and 2020 to support ultralowemission vehicles  38 million of this has already been earmarked for public charging points there are more innovative responses to ev rise too nissan in partnership with italian energy provider enel has announced it will install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk with their innovative v2g technology  cars plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary so when there is a peak in demand the grid could access the cars stored energy to help meet it the total capacity of the 18000 nissan electric vehicles currently operational on uk roads comes to around 180 mw so even today  before electric vehicles have really taken off  this could give the national grid an additional supply roughly the size of a small power station peaks in electricity demand however tend to occur in the late afternoon or evening as it gets dark and more lighting and heating gets switched on this also happens to be rush hour so under this scheme the time of day the cars are most likely to be on the roads is also when itd be most helpful to have them plugged in this could lead to financial incentives for people to give up the flexibility of driving their cars only when they need to more electric cars more demand for electricity more pollution more evs on the road makes sound environmental sense  they enable a 40 reduction in co2 emissions  but ultimately the energy still has to come from somewhere that means more power stations the scale of this new demand shouldnt be underestimated if european drivers were to go 80 electric some studies have suggested it would require 150 gw of additional ondemand capacity  the equivalent of 40 draxsized power stations but if evs are to live up to their green potential that additional power needs to come from innovations in storage such as in the nissan example and from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass fossil fuels would ideally be used only to plug any gaps that intermittency creates  for example by briefly firing up the small gas power stations drax plans to build in england and wales what does this mean for generators drax as operator of the uks largest biomass power station and with plans for new rapid response open cycle gas turbines ocgts is well placed to be at the forefront of providing reliable affordable power in the event of a widespread rollout of electric vehicles the ocgts in particular are designed for use in peak times which in the future could be when the nations electric vehicles are plugged in overnight  today this is when electricity demand is at its lowest a future of more electric cars is a positive one theyre cleaner
