accurate electric insights now available drax electric insights uses sheffield solar data to deliver most accurate realtime power data website 29 june 2018 drax electric insights an interactive website which provides live data and analysis on the supply demand price and environmental impact of britains electricity has been upgraded to deliver the most accurate up to date information yet the information used by the website now includes data from sheffield solar  the uk photovoltaic industrys leading scientific data resource their data complements the information supplied by national grid and elexon who run the electricity and balancing markets respectively which means electric insights can provide more accurate real time and historic information about solar power on the system drax electric insights quarterly was launched in 2016 with reports delivered independently by a team of academics at imperial college london  facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants dr iain staffell from imperial college london said the uk has around a million solar pv installations but virtually none of them are metered on an hourbyhour basis information on distributed renewable generation has been very difficult to access  until now this new data feed from sheffield solar means the electric insights platform can deliver the most accurate near realtime information about whats happening right across the power sector dr alastair buckley who heads up the sheffield solar group at the university of sheffield said were delighted that drax electric insights have chosen to source their solar pv data directly from us we strive to make our solar pv data as accurate as possible to help national grid operate as efficiently and as low carbon as possible and its great to see the data coming directly into electric insights  making visible the changes and challenges of the gb electricity sector ian foy head of ancillary services at drax said the energy sector is often criticised for being overly complex drax electric insights was born out of our desire to improve things by making the power sector more accessible to everyone since then it has become an important tool in helping organisations as well as individuals to better understand how the system works these latest improvements will make it an even more relevant resource delivering greater transparency ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of news e email protected t 07712670888 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 0203 9434305 editors notes about

staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry guest authors have come from the national farmers union national grid and renewable uk the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009 until the present new features day ahead prices more
