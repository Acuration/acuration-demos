biomass energy investment programme in biomass capacity expansion and cost reduction 19 november 2019 investors highlights targeting biomass selfsupply capacity of five million tonnes by 2027 15 million tonnes of existing capacity plus 035 million tonnes of lowcost capacity announced at the 2019 half year results evaluating options for a further three million tonnes over the next seven years supports target to reduce biomass cost by c30 percent to c50mwh targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital trading update  inline with expectations acquired assets performing strongly capacity market restored and included in 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 will gardiner drax group ceo said draxs purpose is to enable a zerocarbon lower cost energy future we believe sustainable biomass has a longterm critical role to play thats why we plan to supply 80 percent of our biomass from our own sources  a significant increase on the 20 percent we currently selfsupply supplying more of our own biomass will cut costs and reduce supply chain risks ensuring our biomass power generation remains viable in the long term when combined with carbon capture it will also enable negative emissions helping the uk on its path to net zero by 2050 will gardiner ceo drax group click to viewdownload in high res capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and his management team will update on how the group is delivering on its purpose the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees in growing its biomass supply and renewable generation businesses investment in biomass to increase capacity and reduce cost as a part of the groups key strategic objective of building a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce its cost of biomass to a level which is economic without subsidy in 2027 these savings will be delivered through further optimisation of existing biomass operations and greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other renewable fuels and a significant expansion of selfsupply capacity drax is targeting five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity by 2027 15 million today plus 035 million tonnes in development with greater scope for operational leverage and cost reduction drax will continue to work with its current suppliers to develop its portfolio at the 2019 half year results drax announced an investment in lowcost capacity at its existing three sites in the us gulf adding 350k tonnes of new capacity by 2021 the capital cost is in the region of 50 million enabling targeted fuel cost savings in excess of 15mwh on the additional capacity once commissioned drax is evaluating options to deliver an additional three million tonnes of capacity these options are expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital with strong cash flow generation and a fast payback these activities would enable drax to develop an unsubsidised biomass generation business by 2027 with the option to service wood pellet demand in other markets  europe north america and asia biomass sustainability is at the heart of the groups activities and drax has implemented industry leading processes which support this expansion encourage forest growth and make a positive contribution to climate change drax lasalle bioenergy wood pellet plant in louisiana is now colocated with a sawmill a new rail spur became operational at lasalle earlier in 2019 click to viewdownload options for gas generation drax continues to see flexible gas generation as an enabler of greater renewable and low carbon generation in addition to supporting the development of hydrogen any investment decision would reflect draxs objective of delivering earnings visibility and be underpinned by a 15year capacity agreement to support a low doubledigit rate of return drax would consider a range of funding options including partnerships consistent with draxs balance sheet objective of around 2 x net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 over time capital allocation and dividend drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 trading and operational performance the performance of the assets acquired from iberdrola in december 2018 has been strong particularly the pumped storage business which has performed well driven by the system support market drax reiterates the adjusted ebitda 1 guidance provided at the time of acquisition of 90110 million in the 2019 financial year in july drax completed the refinancing of the acquisition bridge facility used to acquire these assets these facilities now extend the groups debt maturity profile to 2029 adding an esg 2 facility with a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on draxs carbon emissions against an annual benchmark the groups cost of debt is now below four percent and below three percent on the new facilities reflecting the groups reduced business risk the group continues to identify opportunities to optimise its balance sheet and cash flow during the summer drax completed major planned outages on two biomass units following a delayed return to service the plan is to run all four roc 3 units at high utilisation levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 the outlook for coal generation remains challenging and drax continues to monitor the situation with regards to future operation noting that all unabated uk coal generation must close by 2025 following formal confirmation from the uk government drax expects the capacity market to be reinstated shortly with full retrospective payments made for the capacity provided capacity payments due to drax for 2019 and since the suspension of the capacity market in 2018 are 75 million drax expects these to be included in 2019 adjusted ebitda 1  with cash settlement in january 2020 these factors underpin the groups expectations for full year adjusted ebitda 1  which remain unchanged and around 2 x net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 when adjusted to reflect cash payment of retrospective capacity payments received in

a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags gas  biomass energy  sustainability  energy policy  careers  about us  investors  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation capturing carbon emissions from the atmosphere could transform these industries 24 april 2019 carbon capture countries companies and industries around the world are racing to find ways to reduce their emissions but looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim negative emissions negative emissions technologies nets can actually absorb more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit and theyre vitally important for avoiding catastrophic manmade climate change without nets it could be impossible to achieve the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ambition of keeping temperatures under 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels one example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs it is what its name suggests using technologies to capture and store the co 2 generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere beccs holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry drax power station is currently piloting one form of this technology on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of co 2 a day but if it were deployed across all its biomass units beccs technology could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station beyond the power industry however theres scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably there are already five sites around the world where beccs is being trialled and implemented at scale laying the road to negative emissions storing co 2 from ethanol production in the illinois basin the ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of beccs including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world the illinois industrial carbon capture and storage project is part of a corntoethanol plant in the us that has the capacity to capture 1 million tonnes of co 2 every year  here corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygendeprived environment this process creates co 2 as a byproduct which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the illinois basin under the facility researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year norways cement challenge concrete is one of the worlds most versatile building materials as a result it is the second mostconsumed material in the world behind water  more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year however its key ingredient  cement which acts as concretes binding agent  is made using a hugely carbonintensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6 of all global carbon emissions the norcem cement plant in brevik southeast norway has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement which must heat ingredients to 1500 degrees celsius now its taking this a step further by becoming part of the countrys ambitious full chain ccs project the project will see 400000 tonnes of co 2 captured annually which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on norways western coast from here a pipeline will transport the co 2 50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the north seas bed the plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale the pipeline will be capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of co 2 per year  meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries burning waste and growing algae in a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial but combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions in japan however a biomassfired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions to get this project up and running toshiba the firm behind the project had to overcome unique challenges for example waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals than in ethanol or power production including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture now running at commercial scale the saga city waste incineration plant isnt just capturing co 2  its also utilising it to cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm  the carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products such as body and skin lotions carbon isnt the only thing finding new use at the facility reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 tokyo olympics the carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3000 tonnes of co 2 a year but it isnt the regions first deployments of beccs fully integrating beccs into biomass power nearby the mikawa power plant on the fukuoka prefecture is leading the race in asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station the 50 mw power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with toshiba at the time it was powered by coal however in 2017 the plant upgraded to a 100 biomass boiler fuelled by palm kernel shells  a waste product from palm oil extraction mills now its in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities with a target of being operational in 2020 the system  which after drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100 biomass feedstock  will have the capacity to capture more than 50 of the biomass plants co 2 emissions or as much as 180000 tonnes per year  japans government is now supporting efforts to develop co 2 transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year pulping wood and growing food beccs technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organicmatterbased industries but with many pulp and paper mills already using byproducts such as hog fuel  in generating power for their sites its a prime area for beccs growth in saintfelicien quebec commercialscale carbon capture technology is being deployed at a pulp mill run by resolute forest products and as of march 2019 had a capacity of capturing 11000 tonnes of co 2 a year rather than storage however it supplies the carbon to a cucumbergrowing greenhouse next door to the mill  as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25 of the greenhouses heating needs both long established biomassbased industries like ethanol and paper and new sectors like electricity are now adopting beccs technology and driving innovation the biomass feedstocks involved in beccs must however be sourced sustainably  or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere it should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way found a recent global biomass markets report from ricardo aea for the uks department for business energy and industrial strategy beis while its still a complex technology to deploy beccs is increasingly operating at larger scales and growing to the level needed to seriously reduce industrial co 2 emissions and help to combat climate change learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the

energy  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  climate change heating the future 9 april 2019 sustainable bioenergy we all want our homes and our workplaces to be warm and cosy but not at the cost of catastrophic climate change thats why decarbonising our heating is a challenge that simply cannot be ignored making decisions about how this is done requires careful consideration and a detailed deliverable national strategy here we discuss the key issues in decarbonising heat the numbers the climate change act commits the uk to reducing its carbon emissions by at least 80 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2050 as heating our homes and workplaces is responsible for almost one fifth of our countrys total carbon emissions we are clearly going to need to make huge changes to the way we keep our homes and workplaces warm in order to meet those commitments over 80 of energy used in homes is for heating  suggesting large potential for continued decarbonisation  energising britain progress impacts and outlook for transforming britains energy system  by i staffell m jansen a chase c lewis and e cotton 2018 improved insulation greater energy efficiency and electrification will all reduce the need for fossil fuelbased heating however domestic energy efficiency in the uk is lagging well behind targets although the situation varies from region to region  and such targets do not even exist yet for the nondomestic sector  roof insulation material even in a low or zerocarbon future were still going to need to keep our homes and workplaces warm  and affordably future policy against this backdrop in march 2018 the uk government issued a call for evidence for a future framework for heat in buildings chancellor phillip hammond introduced a new future homes standard in his 2019 spring budget statement  mandating the end of fossil fuel heating systems gas boilers will be banned from all new homes from 2025 a major change is coming but what else will we need to change in order to transform our heating systems 1 more electrification the most noticeable change in the way we heat our homes and workspaces in the future may well come from the need to switch from systems that fuelled by natural gas to ones that are driven by electricity some technologies that can offer a solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating depend on a significant amount of electricity to keep the warmth flowing for instance the hybrid heat pump scenario which is currently supported by the committee on climate change would see up to 85 of a consumers need for heat being met by lowcarbon electricity to give some context to that figure according to the committee  85 per cent of the uks homes now rely on fossilfuel derived natural gas for heating and hot water and on average these currently emit around 2tco 2 per household per year which represents around one tenth of the average uk households carbon footprint changing from a situation where our heating depends on 85 fossil fuel gas to one that depends on 85 low or zero carbon electricity is little short of a complete transformation given that the new future homes standard is due to be introduced in less than six years this transformation will need to happen quickly of course a great deal of the extra electricity needed will come from intermittent renewables such as wind turbines and solar panels  especially as the cost of renewable electricity is falling  much of that power looks likely to be supplied by distributed sources rather than those integrated into the national grid indeed since 2011 power generation capacity connected directly to the distribution network grew from 12 gigawatts gw to more than 40 gw by the end of 2017 according to estimates from energy experts cornwall insight in a report for our b2b energy supply business haven power with so much of our electricity reliant on the weather there will still be a need for dispatchable and flexible thermal sources and energy storage such as drax and cruachan power stations  their centralised power generation can be turned up and fed directly into the national transmission system at short notice to keep our heating running and our homes warm dam and reservoir cruachan power station scotland such a transformation will obviously require careful strategic planning as well as an enormous amount of investment there may well be no single solution to the challenge of heat decarbonisation rather a number of different solutions that depend on where people live and work their individual circumstances the energy efficiency of their homes and the resources they have close at hand but while it has previously been reported that the overall or system costs of electrifying heating could be as much as three times the cost of using gas another study suggests that the costs could be much closer 2 more heat pumps heat pumps that absorb environmental warmth and use it to provide low carbon heating have always been considered a possible option for the four million homes and countless workplaces that are not currently connected to the uks mains gas network recently expert opinion has been changing with hybrid heat pumps seen as a workable solution even for homes and workplaces that are connected to gas supplies indeed in 2018 the committee on climate change stated that hybrid heat pumps can be the lowest cost option where homes are sufficiently insulated or can be insulated affordably this means that they may be one of the simplest and most affordable options to provide the heating of the future hybrid heat pumps draw heat from the air or ground around them and use a boiler to provide extra heat when the weather is exceptionally cold in a low carbon future that boiler could be fuelled by biogas in a zero carbon situation it could be powered by hydrogen heat pumps can be airsource ashp  absorbing warmth from the atmosphere like the heat exchanger in your fridge in reverse  or ground source gshp gshps absorb heat through on a network of pipes a ground loop buried or a vertical borehole drilled in the earth outside your home or workplace both ashps and gshps can be used to support underfloor heating or a radiator system though neither will provide water heated to the high temperature a natural gas boiler will reach to keep radiators hot and even though the warmth they absorb is free heat pumps depend on a supply of electricity to condense it and to bring it back to the heating system inside the house this electricity could be generated by distributed power from local solar pv wind turbines drawn from batteries or even from the low carbon grid of the future it is worth noting that the size of heat pumps and the amount of land they require  especially gshp  makes them a less attractive solution for people who live or work in built up areas such as cities while for those who live in blocks of flats it is difficult to see how individual heat pumps could be a practical solution 3 more hydrogen the idea of switching the mains gas grid to store and transport hydrogen has long appealed as a potential solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating renewable hydrogen could then be burnt in domestic boilers similar to those we currently use for natural gas the benefits are many hydrogen produces no carbon emissions when burnt and can be stored and transported in much the same way as natural gas provided old metal pipes have been replaced with modern alternatives and given the sunk costs involved in the existing gas grid and in the network of pipes and radiators already installed in tens of millions of homes hydrogen has always been expected to be the lowest cost option too however according to the committee on climate changes latest findings  hydrogen should not be seen as a silver bullet solution capable of transforming our entire heating landscape in a single change the main reasons they give for this judgment are the relatively high cost of the electricity required to produce sufficient hydrogen to power tens of millions of boilers the undesirability of relying on substantial imports of hydrogen and the lack of a carbonfree method to supply the gas costeffectively at scale hydrogen could however be produced by gas reformation of the emissions retained by bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs such as that being pioneered at drax power station carbon capture use and storage ccus of which beccs is the renewable variant is supported by the uk government through its clean growth strategy as it has potential to accelerate decarbonisation in power and industrial sectors extremely rapid progress to provide hydrogen in sufficient quantities from beccs is unlikely  but the first schemes could begin operating in the late 2020s hydrogen production also has the potential to radically transform the economics of ccus making it a much more attractive investment  it was originally assumed that the power required to drive the energyintensive process of hydrogen created via electrolysis would come from surplus electricity generated by intermittent renewables at times of low demand however that surplus is not now generally regarded as likely to be sufficiently large to be relied upon it is these limitations together with a comprehensive model of the likely costs involved in different approaches to decarbonisation that led the committee on climate change to suggest that hybrid heat pumps could provide the bulk of domestic heating in the future at present it seems likely that converting to hydrogenfuelled boilers will mainly be an attractive option for those who live and work near areas where the renewable fuel can be most easily created and stored the north of england is a prime example  close to the energy and carbon intensive areas of the humber and tees valleys where ccus and hydrogen clusters could be located with good access to north sea carbon stores such as aquifers and former gas fields 4 more solar many homes in the uk  especially in the south  could be heated electrically without carbon emissions at the point of use solar thermal for water heating or solar pvs for electric and water heating common sights on domestic property rooftops the intermittency of solar power need not be an issue as the electricity generated could then be stored in batteries behind the meter until it is needed however the lack of sufficient daylight for much of the year in many parts of the uk could together with the still relatively high cost of battery storage  still mean that this would not necessarily be a solution that can be applied at scale to millions of homes and workplaces all year round as the cost of battery storage continues to fall  it may well be that solar becomes a more practical and costeffective solution 5 more biomass more geothermal sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets and biomass boilers have long been proposed as a potential solution to decarbonising heating for the many people who live and work off the mains gas grid bioenergy as a whole  including biogas as well as wood pellets  now provides around four percent of uk heat up from 14 in 2008 the main barriers to this are the current relatively high cost of biomass boilers this is currently offset by the renewable heating incentive rhi which the uk government has committed to continuing until 2021 as this solution is adopted by more consumers it is anticipated that the real costs of such new technology will fall as economies of scale start to take effect in much the same way that solar pv and battery technology has recently become more affordable 6 more geothermal ruins of a tin mine wheal coates mine st agnes cornwall england geothermal energy uses the heat stored beneath the surface of our planet itself to provide the energy we need while in some countries such as iceland  geothermal energy is used to drive turbines to generate electricity that is then used to provide power for heating it is envisaged that in the uk it could be converted into warmth through massive heat pumps that provide heating to entire communities  especially those in former mining areas there is already one geothermal district heating scheme in operation in the uk in southampton  it is envisaged that such geothermal schemes would work most effectively at a district level providing zero carbon heat to many homes and workplaces according to a recent report  geothermal energy has the potential to produce up to 20 per cent of uk electricity and heat for millions at present drilling is being carried out to see if geothermal heating could be viable in cornwall  however there is no reason why it could not be used in disused coalmines too where ground source heat pumps gshps would absorb and condense the required heat this means that geothermal could have strong potential as a solution to the challenge of decarbonisation for former mining communities 7 more chp cory riverside energys resource recovery facility in belvedere london could be operated as a chp plant in the future by using the heat created in thermal renewable electricity generation  such as biomass  in combined heat and power schemes businesses and individuals can reduce their energy costs and their carbon emissions such schemes can work well for new developments on a district basis and are already popular in mainland europe especially sweden denmark and switzerland warm homes factories and offices there are already a number of viable solutions to decarbonising heating in the uk they rely on smart policy smarter technology and customers taking control of their energy rather than any one of these technologies providing a single solution that can help every consumer and business in the country to meet the challenge in the same way it is more likely that it will be met by a number of different solutions depending on geography cost and individual circumstances these will sometimes also work in concert rather than alone the uk has made solid progress on reducing carbon emissions  especially in power generation  when it comes to heating buildings rapid decarbonisation is now needed and that decarbonisation must avoid fuel poverty and help to rebalance the economy  find out more about energy in buildings in energising britain  progress impacts and outlook for transforming

power from one of the big six energy suppliers which buy electricity from the wholesale market and then sells it to consumers however with more businesses and consumers looking for less carbonintense electricity sources there are now a whole host of smaller companies taking on the incumbents and offering allrenewable electricity from ovo to bulb to draxs own haven power and opus energy  consumers and businesses have more and greener options than ever about where to buy their electricity with many even offering 100 renewable electricity but how do these companies ensure the megawatts powering homes offices and street lights come from renewable sources cleaning up the river the electricity we use doesnt just flow through a single cable from a power station to our houses it travels through whats called the transmissions system which is run by national grid eso and local distribution network operators  apart from offgrid installations like solar panels on buildings some of which are unable to export their unused power all the electricity generated by different sources around the country goes into this same system it means megawatts generated by a wind turbine get mixed up with those generated by a nuclear reactor or a coal power station think of it as a river although it is its own entity it is fed by multiple streams of water coming from different sources in the case of electricity megawatts from various generators are fed into a central system which then enter homes offices and devices around the country so what makes green power generated from renewable sources green power used in homes suppliers cant control exactly what megawatts you use but they can influence the makeup of the overall river your electricity is pulled from by what electricity they agree to buy and offer to their customers renewable suppliers match the amount of electricity their customers use with the amount they buy from renewable sources so if a home uses 4 megawatthours mwh a year  a supplier will need to ensure it buys an equal amount of power from national grid which national grid sources from generators if that supplier offers 100 renewable power it will need to ensure it has the right kinds of deals in place with renewable generators to deliver that amount of power it means that while the river of electricity is still a mix from different streams more of the water will come from renewable streams therefore if more homes and businesses switch to renewable suppliers more of the overall river will be renewable which will in turn help to decarbonise the electricity system enabling a lowercarbon economy but how does this fit into the existing electricity business and infrastructure but how do suppliers actually buy renewable power from generators the business of electricity to understand how suppliers ensure they are buying renewable power you first need to understand how the business works or at least how it used to the most obvious place to start is with the generators be they gas power stations or an offshore wind farm the generator is where electricity is produced and are often owned by a supplier suppliers can buy electricity from their own generators often months or years ahead of delivery but if there is a shortfall the supplier can also buy electricity on the wholesale market where other generators can sell their electricity because suppliers are on a competitive market their aim is to buy the electricity for the lowest possible price and sell it for more  but at a better rate than rivals measures like carbon prices or green incentives help lower the cost of renewable and lowcarbon generation and position it as a more economically viable purchase than more expensive fossil fuels like coal  renewableonly suppliers also want to buy electricity as cheap as possible and sell it as affordably as possible but unlike standard suppliers they only buy electricity from renewable sources this can be done by purchasing electricity from independent renewable generators on the wholesale market or arranged through what are known as power purchase agreements  ppas   longerterm contracts between generators and suppliers agreeing on a specific amount of power the advantage of these for the renewable generator is it secures revenue for the future while for the supplier it means a dependable source of electricity for large installations these deals are often signed before construction even begins to ensure investors there will be a return transitioning to a lowcarbon electricity system however is not just about suppliers buying more electricity from renewable sources the future of electricity suppliers as more businesses individuals and communities are becoming prosumers and generating their own electricity the wider role of the supplier in the system is changing the governments feedintariffs financially reward customers for generating their own electricity even if they dont export it to the grid but even small generators can sign deals with suppliers to sell electricity through schemes such as good energys smartgen policy which is open to generators with between 10 and 100 kilowatts kw of installed capacity similarly opus energy helps over 2100 businesses sell more than 1100 gigawatthours gwh of excess wind solar anaerobic digestion and hydro power for larger prosumer businesses the relationship with suppliers and the grid is different rather than the traditional buying and selling of electricity it requires a cooperative approach to understand how the prosumer can best utilise their assets  beyond increasing the amount of lowcarbon electricity decarbonising the electricity system also means making more efficient use of energy and managing the data that can help improve efficiency haven powers partnership with thames water sees it analyse an average of 68 million halfhour smart meter readings every year using the data to help the company improve its billing and forecasting as the wider system becomes more intelligent suppliers will be able to better forecast how much electricity its customers use and help them reduce their consumption the role required of suppliers in a changing system will create opportunities for more renewable and efficient use of electricity and empower more consumers to get their electricity from lowcarbon sources that can help to make the whole countrys electricity greener want a different perspective on the same story watch tvs jonny ball explain  tags opus energy  renewable energy  haven power  electricity  customers  wind

draxs existing ocgt projects other smaller sites the portfolio also includes a small ccgt in blackburn 60mw and a 50k tonne biomassfromwaste facility in daldowie which benefits from a firm offtake contract agreement with scottish water until 2026 benefits of the acquisition a leading provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility increased earnings potential aligned with generation strategy and uk energy needs the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with

parties and consideration the acquisition agreement was entered into on 16 october 2018 between drax smart generation and the seller pursuant to the acquisition agreement the seller has agreed to sell and drax smart generation has agreed to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of spgen for 702 million subject to certain customary adjustments in respect of cash debt and working capital drax group holdings limited has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of drax smart generation under the acquisition agreement scottish power uk plc has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of the seller under the acquisition agreement conditions to completion the acquisition is conditional on the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules the shareholder approval condition and the cma having indicated that it has no further questions at that stage in response to precompletion engagement by drax or the cma having provided a decision that the acquisition will not be subject to a reference under the uk merger control regime completion is currently expected to occur on 31 december 2018 assuming that the conditions are satisfied by that date termination for material reduction in available generation capacity drax smart generation has the right to terminate the acquisition agreement upon the occurrence of a material reduction in available generation capacity at any of the cruachan galloway and lanark or damhead creek facilities which subsists or is reasonably likely to subsist for a continuous period of three months the right of drax smart generation to terminate in these circumstances is subject to the sellers right to defer completion if the relevant material reduction in available generation capacity can be resolved by end of the month following the anticipated date of completion break fee a break fee of 146 million equal to 1 of draxs market capitalisation at close of business on the day before announcement is payable if the shareholder approval condition is not met save where this is as a result of a material reduction in available generation capacity as described above precompletion covenants the seller has given certain customary covenants in relation to the period between signing of the acquisition agreement and completion including to carry on the spgen business in the ordinary and usual course the seller will carry out certain reorganisation steps prior to completion pension liabilities drax smart generation has agreed to assume the accrued defined benefit pension liabilities associated with the employees of the spgen group as at the date of signing the acquisition agreement following completion the spgen group will continue to participate in the sellers group defined benefit pension scheme known as the scottishpower pension scheme spps for an interim period of 12 months unless agreed otherwise the interim period while a new pension scheme is set up by the spgen group for the benefit of its employees the new scheme at the end of the interim period the spps trustees will be requested to transfer from the spps to the new scheme an amount of liabilities and corresponding share of assets agreed between the seller and drax smart generation or failing agreement an amount determined by an independent actuary in respect of the past service liabilities relating to the spgen group employees if the amount of assets transferred to the new scheme does not match the amount agreed or independently determined there will be a trueup between the seller and drax smart generation if the spps trustees do not make any transfer to the new scheme within the period of 18 months following the interim period unless this was caused by a breach of the acquisition agreement by the seller drax smart generation has agreed to pay 16 million plus base rate interest to the seller as compensation for the spps liabilities not taken on by the new scheme sellers warranties indemnities and tax covenant the seller has provided customary warranties in the acquisition agreement the seller also has provided drax smart generation with indemnities in respect of certain specific matters including for any losses associated with the reorganisation referred to above a customary tax covenant is also provided in the acquisition agreement transitional services agreement the seller and spgen will enter into a transitional services agreement effective at completion the specific nature terms and charges relating to the services to be provided will be agreed between the seller and spgen prior to completion the seller will also provide assistance in relation to the extraction and separation of the spgen group from the systems of the seller and integration of the spgen group onto the systems of the drax group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material change from the historical 10year average rainfall there are no material adverse events that have a significant impact on the financial performance of any of the acquired assets including any more unplanned outages than would be expected in the ordinary course prior to completion the business will be operated in the ordinary course there are no material issues with the transitional services provided by scottish power to drax pursuant to the tsa including the migration of such services to drax there is no material change in the management or control of the drax group end tags biomass energy  gas  investors  decarbonisation  daldowie  electricity generation  hydroelectric power  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy storage how to switch a power station off coal 22 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy in 2003 the uks biggest coal power station took its first steps away from the fossil fuel which defined electricity generation for more than a century it was in that year that drax power station began cofiring biomass as a renewable alternative to coal it symbolised the beginnings of the power stations ambitious transformation from fossilfuel stalwart to the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator this plan presented a massive engineering challenge for drax with significant amounts of new knowledge quickly needed fifteen years later three of its generating units now run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of biomass while coal has been relegated to stepping in only to cover spikes in demand and improve system stability  now drax has converted a fourth unit from coal to biomass this development represents the passing of a two thirds marker for the power stations coalfree ambitions and adds 600plus megawatts mw of renewable electricity to great britains national transmission system  building on the past drax first converted a coal unit to biomass in 2013 with two more following in 2014 and 2016 this put drax in an interesting position going into a new conversion on one hand it is one of the most experienced generators in the world when it comes to dealing with and upgrading to biomass on the other its still relatively new to the low carbon fuel compared with its dealings with coal adam nicholson weve decades of understanding of how to use coal but weve only been operating with biomass since we started the full conversion trials in 2011 says adam nicholson section head for process performance at drax power weve got few running hours under our belts with the new fuel versus the hundreds of man years of coal knowledge and operation all around the country when converting a generating unit the steam turbine and generator itself remain the same the difference is all in the material being delivered stored crushed and blown into the boiler and burned to heat up water and create steam and because biomass can be a volatile substance  much more so than coal  this process must be a careful one drax could build on the learnings and equipment it had already developed for biomass such as specially built trains and pulverising mills  but storage proved a bigger issue the giant biomass domes at drax that make up the ecostore are advanced technological structures carefully attuned to storing biomass but for unit 4 they were off limits instead drax engineers had to come up with another solution the journey of a pellet through the power station normally wood pellets are brought into drax by train unloaded and stored in the biomass domes before travelling through the power station to the mills and then boilers  unit 4 however sits in the second half of the station  built 12 years after the first this slight change in location presented a problem theres no link from the eco store to unit 4 at all explains nicholson you cant use the storage domes and that whole infrastructure to get anything to unit 4 drax engineers set about designing a new conveyor system that could connect the domes to the mills and boiler that powers unit 4 after weeks of design the team had a theoretical plan to connect the two locations with one problem it was entirely uneconomical rail unloading building 1 and storage silos if we were building a new plant it would be relatively easy because you could plan properly and wouldnt have existing equipment in the way says nicholson we had to plan around it and make use of the preexisting plant within that preexisting plant though were vital pieces of equipment some of which had laid dormant since drax stopped fuelling its boilers with a mixture of coal and biomass and opted instead for full unit conversions drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003 using two different materials  a mix of around 5 biomass and 95 coal a direct injection facility was added in 2005 it involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power stations 60 mills  then the amount of renewable power drax was able to generate roughly doubled in the summer of 2010 when a 400 mw cofiring facility became operational back to the present day its fortunate for the unit 4 conversion that the cofiring facility includes its own rail unloading building rub 1 and storage silos they are located much closer to the unit than the bigger rub 2 and the massive biomass domes this solved the problem of storage but moving the required volumes of biomass through the plant without significant transport construction still posed a challenge rail unloading building 1 and storage silos for unit 4 left ecostore biomass domes for units 13 right to tackle this the team modified a pneumatic transport system previously tested during cofiring to have the capability to blow entire pellets from the storage facilities around the power station at speeds of more than 20 metres per second the success of this system proved key  it was the final piece necessary to make the conversion of unit 4 economical  the postcoal future andy koss for now draxs fifth and sixth generating unit remain coalpowered but are called upon less frequently with great britain set to go completely coalfree by 2025 there are plans to convert these too but as part of a system of combined cycle gas turbines and giant batteries rather than biomass powered units its an opportunity for drax to again leverage its preexisting plant and provide the grid with a fast actingsource of lowercarbon electricity as with converting to biomass it will pose a complex new engineering challenge  one that will prepare drax to meet the future needs of grid as it continues to change and demand greater flexibility from generators the speed at which the unit 4 project has been delivered is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we continue to see at drax were nimble and innovative enough to meet future challenges says andy koss chief executive drax power we may look very different in 10 or 20 years time but the ethos of that innovation and agility is something that will persist repowering the remaining coal plant with gas and up to 200 mw of batteries will sit alongside research into areas such as carbon capture use and storage ccus that is all geared towards expanding drax power beyond a single site generator into a portfolio of flexible power production facilities unit 4s conversion is more than just a step beyond halfway for the power stations decarbonisation but a significant step towards becoming entirely coalfree  find out more

industry 40 describes this emerging era when the combination of data and automation is transforming longestablished practices and business models autonomous cars are perhaps one of most widelyknown examples of smart technology slowly inching towards daily life but they are far from the only example there is almost no sector untouched by this oncoming digital disruption  even industries as old as forestry are being transformed from smart and selfdriving vehicles to datacrunching drones forestry 40 is ushering in a new era for efficient and sustainable forest management drones and data if the first industrial revolution was powered by steam the fourth is being powered by data collecting information on every aspect of a process allows smart devices and machines to cut out inefficiencies and optimise a task in forestry capturing and utilising huge amounts of data can build a better understanding of the land and trees that make up forests one of the best ways to gather this data from wide complex landscapes is through aerial imaging satellites have long been used to monitor the changing nature of the worlds terrain and in 2021 the european space agency plans to use radar in orbit to weigh and monitor the weight of earths forests  but with the rise of drones aerial imagining technology is becoming more widely accessible now even smallscale farmers and foresters can take a birdseye view of their land oxfordbased company biocarbon engineering focuses on replanting areas of forests it utilises drone technology to scan environments and identify features such as obstacles and terrain types which it uses to design and optimise planting patterns a drone then follows this path roughly three to six feet off the ground shooting biodegradable seed pods into the ground every six seconds along the way biocarbon claims this approach can allow it to plant as many as 100000 trees in a single day gathering data on the health of working forests doesnt necessarily require cuttingedge equipment either in the smartphone era any forestry professional now has the computing power in their pocket to capture detailed information about a forests condition mobile app moti was designed by researchers at the school of agricultural forest and food sciences at the bern university of applied sciences in switzerland it allows users to scan an area of forest with a phones camera and receive calculatedestimates on variables such as trees per hectare tree heights and the basal area land occupied by tree trunks automating the harvest capturing data from forests can play a huge part in developing a better understanding of the land terrain and trees of working forests which leads to better decision making for healthier forests including how and when to harvest and thin  but the equipment and technology carrying out these tasks on the ground are also undergoing smarttech transformations selfdriving and electric vehicles are expected to disrupt multiple industries including forestry swedish startup einride recently unveiled a driverless fully electric truck that can haul as much as 16tonnes of lumber and is specially designed for offroad often unmapped terrain there are some pieces of equipment however that will be harder to fully automate  for example harvesters which are used to fell and remove trees their long diggerlike arm normally features a head consisting of a chainsaw clawgrips and rollers all in one which are controlled from the vehicles cab even as image recognition and sensors improve automating these types of machines entirely is hugely challenging an ideal use of artificial intelligence ai would be enabling a harvester to identify trees of a particular age or species to remove as part of thinning for example without disturbing the rest of the forest however trees of the same species and age can differ from each other depending on factors such as regional climates soil and even lighting at the time of analysis this makes programming a machine to harvest a specific species and age of tree is very difficult nevertheless innovation such as intelligent boom control  as john deere is exploring  can help human operators automate movements and make harvesting safer and more efficient forestry has always changed as technology has advanced  from the invention of the axe to the incorporation of ecology  and the digital revolution is no different smart sensors and deeper data will ultimately help optimise the lifecycle biodiversity and health of managed forests with thanks to the institute of chartered foresters for
