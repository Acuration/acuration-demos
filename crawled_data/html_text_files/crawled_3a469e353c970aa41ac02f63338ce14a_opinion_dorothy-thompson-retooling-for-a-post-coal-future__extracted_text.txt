retooling for a postcoal future the energy system is changing to be a truly modern energy company so must drax this is how were doing it says dorothy thompson drax group ceo dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 6 december 2016 opinion the energy system in great britain is dramatically changing where it was once an industry dominated by coal  a predictable but dirty fuel now our power increasingly comes from renewables  this is a trend that will continue forcing more coal off the system drax has a role in this new future of renewable power we have already converted half of our power station in north yorkshire to run on renewable biomass  and now to support the needs of a system increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables like solar and wind we are developing plans to build four new stateoftheart flexible power stations  two in england and two in wales each will be 299 mw in size and powered by gas two of them could be producing electricity by 2020 its the next step for us in helping change the way energy is generated for a better future supporting a renewable energy mix wind and solar accounted for 15 of britains electricity mix between july and september from an installed capacity that has increased six fold in just six years biomass generation at drax rose from almost nothing to producing 20 the countrys renewable power in the first half of this year renewable energy has come on leaps and bounds this decade  perhaps more than anyone ever thought it would but as well as being much lower in carbon emissions renewables like wind and solar operate very differently to the fuels the gb grid was built on  theyre intermittent they only work when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing so when it suddenly becomes still or dark we need alternatives that plug the gap deliver power and boost security of supply biomass is one part of how we can do this using lower carbon fuels compressed wood pellets the biomass used at drax is a renewable fuel that can be used to generate baseload power that can also be dialled up and down to meet demand like coal it can also provide the ancillary services the grid needs to stay stable unlike combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants which currently supply roughly 40 of the uks power and take 15 hours to start up from cold our new open cycle gas turbine ocgt plants are like big jet engines  generating electricity at full power in just 20 minutes from cold or 10 minutes from a warm standby its an incredibly fast turnaround and its what the energy network needs and because its a lower carbon fuel than coal with higher flexibility it will support the uks decarbonisation targets  by enabling more wind and solar on the grid we plan to use ocgts to plug the gaps that intermittency creates  essentially flicking the switch on and off at very short notice we anticipate they would run for no more than 1500 hours per year  only at times when the electricity system is under stress through supporting more intermittent renewables we also help to enable more coal off the system a better future for customers this new future will not only mean changes for us the generators but for customers too how energy is supplied and used is evolving and this is something that drax can support with the growing retail side of our business were a company with a wealth of expertise in renewable power and we can use this to help deliver electricity to business customers in a way that caters for todays market were already doing this with haven power  but now were extending this with the acquisition of opus energy  with this new company as part of drax group we will be able to grow our existing retail offering providing more of the uks growing businesses and established industrial and corporates not only with electricity but also with gas our retail offering will provide businesses with a route to sell the power they generate but do not need  plus expertise in how they can use energy more efficiently rd these are the first steps in a new chapter for drax there will be more research and development to come in the future well be looking at how we can extend our american compressed wood pellet supply business drax biomass  and at the potential for power storage systems if we want to continue to be a truly modern energy company that delivers on our aim of changing the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future we need to be able to adapt its always been a part of draxs history and it will be a part of our future share most
