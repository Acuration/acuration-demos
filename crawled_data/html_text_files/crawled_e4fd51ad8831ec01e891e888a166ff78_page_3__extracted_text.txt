electricity dude wheres my autonomous car how selfdriving vehicles will impact electricity 25 april 2018 electrification the selfdriving car is a scifi stalwart the blend of familiar vehicle combined with advancedartificial intelligence makes it a perfect symbol of a nottoodistant future which is fast approaching but what a scifi movie is unlikely to show is a selfdriving car pulling over for half an hour to fill its tank or recharge its batteries as autonomous vehicles gradually inch into our everyday life the question of how they will be powered arises as does whether they will be capable of refuelling or recharging without a helping human hand with governments around the world setting ambitious targets for the phasing out of diesel and petrol car sales its safe to assume the driverless vehicles of the future will be electric but will they be able to charge themselves more than that how would a large influx of these cars coming onto our roads affect our national electricity demand and emissions  how will driverless cars charge themselves development is already well underway to bring humanfree charging to the auto world with a variety of approaches being trialled robotic charging points the most straightforward way to enable selfdriving electric vehicles evs to charge themselves is through updating existing infrastructure adding on robotic limbs to standard charge points would be one way of removing the need for human hands tesla previously demonstrated a porotype of a snakelike arm that plugs into its vehicles charge points that does exactly this undercar charging easier than flailing robotic arms is the idea of charging cars from underneath a parked car unsurprisingly tesla has patented a version of the technology too while building the technology into the ground adds complications it could potentially allow cars to be charged while moving  which is exactly what one road in sweden is doing  the two kilometre stretch outside stockholm features a metal track that an arm under evs can connect to  much like a scalextric track the route is divided into 50metre sections which are electrified separately as vehicles travel over them sweden is now planning to roll the concept out nationally wireless charging a step up from undercar charging wireless technology uses inductive charging rather than physically connecting with the car  and can be installed into parking spaces or be set into the tarmac the problem with this is its not as fast as directly connecting with the car however implemented at scale entire roads could constantly charge vehicles when they need a top up it would mean that rather than taking evs home and plugging them in the city and roads themselves would charge it but even the idea of keeping a car at home might fade as cars become increasingly autonomous rethinking vehicle ownership as more of the worlds population move to cities and they grow increasingly congested car ownership is declining  a trend being further fueled by ridesharing services like uber lyft and didi chuxing in china and as services such as these continue to grow in popularity it could point to a future where rather than owning selfdriving cars they will be shared among urban populations lyft strategist raj kapoor suggested the reduced cost of maintenance of shared evs would make rides cheap enough for the average person to ride in every day  this could result in fewer cars on the roads as intelligent systems allow them to coordinate sharing across the population which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for charging however the more intense computing power needed in selfdriving vehicles means they will each use more electricity than a standard ev  powering these sufficiently will depend on technology and coordination rather than producing significantly more electricity smarter cars smarter cities smarter electricity changes in car ownership could mean the total reshaping of cities if cars dont need to park for long periods of times on central roadsides and in garages vehicles could instead be stored on the outskirts of cities when demand for transport is low and make their way into towns as people begin commuting this vision of cars seemingly independently rolling around cities to exactly where theyre needed depends not on a single car reacting to a single command but to a network of data points connected to almost every aspect of a city more than this theres even potential these cars could provide power as well as use it vehicletogird v2g technology means they can essentially act as batteries and return electricity to the grid when needed a fully connected network of autonomous cars linked to buildings cities and entire electricity networks could be used to help meet demand on a local or national scale helping avoid fossil fuel usage at times of stress while increasing ev usage will likely contribute to an increase in electricity demand selfdriving smarter vehicles will ensure power is used at efficiently as possible and reduce the number of cars drawing electricity from the grid it ultimately means global investment in the charging infrastructure that will create a more connected and economical transport system which will make widespread ev and autonomous cars a reality tags electric vehicles evs  battery energy storage  energy storage  electricity the electric transport revolution 16 april 2018 electrification with rapid technological improvements and falls in battery prices improving performance and reducing the cost experts predict that by 2050 90 of newbuild cars will be powered by electricity  however its not only roads where transport is decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50 should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels although the deal fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the european union to environmental ngos the imo did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out co 2 emissions entirely as paris agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom businesses around the world are innovating small fleets of batterypowered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in norway belgium and the netherlands are preparing to set sail  including some able to run autonomously without a crew  dutch company portliner is also gearing up to launch the first fullyelectric emissionfree barges in europe dubbed tesla ships portliner chief executive officer ton van meegen claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbonneutral batteries  the first six barges alone are expected to remove 23000 trucks from the roads annually in the netherlands replacing them with zeroemission methods of transport china also recently launched an electric cargo ship to haul coal which whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 25 of global greenhouse emissions that result from the maritime transport industry once a farflung fantasy in some areas electrified transport is fast becoming a reality evs and rail are leading the way but its clear the electric transport revolution has a long way to travel tags investors  transport  railways and trains  ships and shipping  decarbonisation  electricity  climate change  electric vehicles evs why does electricity have a sound 11 april 2018 electrification on cold misty mornings the powerlines pylons and transformers that make up great britains electricity system sometimes sound a little different stand in a field under a powerline and in the right conditions the usual sounds of the countryside might be interrupted by the crackling of electricity this buzzing crackle which can be referred to as a corona discharge occurs when theres a change from the normal conditions of a power lines insulators enabling the electric current to partially conduct along it or through the surrounding air to earth this can come as a result of weather conditions or deterioration of the insulators its just one of the instances where electricity changes from an unseen force powering our lights and devices to something we can hear see and even smell why can we hear electricity the source of electricitys sound is also determined by one of its inherent properties frequency  frequency is the measurement of multiple occurrences from events such as sound waves from vibrations over a period of time any equipment that has a frequency causing mechanical parts to undergo repeated change can be audible for example if we hit a cymbal with a drumstick we can hear a crash because of the frequency of the vibrations the mechanical part in this case the cymbal makes we hear a guitar because its strings are plucked and pulled to create vibration at different frequencies and we can hear an audible hum in a transformer because electric currents affect its internal structure and cause vibrations the buzzy tone this creates can be referred to as mains hum and is ever present although not always perceptible to the human ear it becomes audible however when electricity specifically alternating current  ac is applied to a transformer transformers are made of lengths of copper or aluminium which are wound around a steel laminated core when ac is applied it magnetises the core and causes steel laminations in the transformer to expand and contract in a process known as magnetostriction although only small physical changes these movements are enough to cause vibration which in turn creates an audible hum the crackling overhead with more than 7200 km of overhead powerlines humming away constantly around the country corona discharges are inevitable and common this happens when part of the insulators on a highvoltage line begins to deteriorate is exposed to weather conditions is damaged or contaminated allowing electricity to partially flow along it the surrounding air becomes electrically charged through a process known as ionisation and causes molecules to become charged and collide its these collisions in the air that make the corona audible it can also be visible and gives off a distinct smell of ozone the gas produced when air is ionised although not dangerous to someone on the ground below if the insulator on the powerline is left to deteriorate further it can fail completely leading to earth faults that trip power systems making use of electric hums the sounds electricity creates may seem like a nuisance but they can also have important uses one of the most innovative applications is in forensic analysis a technique called electric network frequency enf enables forensic scientists to validate audio recording by observing the frequency of the mains hum picked up by audio recordings which is not audible to humans by comparing the frequency of the hum in a recording to a database of the countrys frequencies at given times its possible to verify when and in which country the recording took place and detect any editing it highlights not only an innovative use of electricity but just how pervasive and consistent a presence it is so while the ebb and flow of electricity through our lives often goes on without thought it is always there humming away while it powers modern life in great britain can you hear this httpstcoroslxjqsnh pictwittercomhqshlmovgg  drax draxgroup april 23 2018 tags electricity  technology the shape of electricity use in 2018 31 january 2018 power generation in homes and offices on streets and in shops there are more electronic devices than ever however for all the phones washing machines and tvs british consumers are plugging in our electricity consumption has been on a downward tick  and has been since the middle of the last decade  at the same time an increasing percentage of our demand is being met by renewable and lowcarbon energy sources by 2016 greenhouse gas emissions from electricity had dropped to 62 below 1990 levels  helping the uk get close to meeting its third carbon budget target its the power sector that has seen the biggest reductions through the decline of coal the greater use of gas and the rise of renewables there are still big strides to make in the economy as a whole  particularly in sectors such as heat transport and buildings but there are positive signs of transformation that could help the country reach its fifth carbon budget goal of lowering emissions by 57 between 1990 and 2030 will 2018 prove to be another milestone year for great britains electricity system and could the electrification of the economy help other sectors stepup their own decarbonisation the efficiency transformation reduced demand for electricity comes in part as a result of the decline in energyintensive manufacturing and heavy industry however in the domestic sector the decline has been equally significant since 2002 energy consumption in the home has fallen 19 from 52229 ktoe kilotonne of oil equivalent to 42486 ktoe as well as electricity this includes gas solid fuels such as coal and more this drop comes despite a growing population economic growth an increase in the number of households and a rising number of consumer devices and appliances  so what exactly is bringing down energy consumption one cause is the increased efficiency of electronics and appliances the phasing out of incandescent lightbulbs  which had hardly changed since edisons day  in favour of energysaving models such as leds has reduced electricity used to light homes by a third since 1997 as well as the improved efficiency of large appliances like fridge freezers there is also a greater consumer awareness of electricity saving habits such as washing clothes at lower temperatures the increase in small batterypowered devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops on the other hand means were spending less time using higherpowered equipment that constantly pulls from the grid such as tvs and hifis what this can lead to however is a change in the shape of electricity demand the shape of power demand can be explored in electric insights  for example overnight when many people choose to charge those batterypowered appliances such changes in demand present a challenge to forecasters at in national grids control room who predict ahead when where and how much power will be needed from the countrys electricity grid shifting demand spikes todays peak electricity demand times remain relatively unchanged from the 20 th century people still come home and turn on lights kettles and washing machines at around 5pm and 6pm but as artificial intelligence makes its way into more and more home appliances  these spikes are likely to level out across the day connected devices will aim to predict peak times and where such tariffs are provided by energy suppliers only run when overall demand costs are lower at the same time lifestyles have changed affecting electricity demand even further in the past some of the biggest surges in uk electrical history came in the immediate aftermath of big tv moments when people across the country switched on kettles opened fridges and went to the toilet now the proliferation of ondemand and online tv has reduced the need for national grid to keep power stations on standby during major televised moments as people choose to watch at their leisure rather than when they are broadcast sports however remains one of the things that still attracts large numbers of live viewers this junes football world cup means the national grid will be braced for any surges in postpenalty shootout tea breaks combined with a royal wedding  the last of which caused a significant spike  summer 2018 could see a few rare moments when mass tv viewing shunts electricity demand enough for it to be noticeable cleaner power but while 2018 may see some instances where demand surges its likely power generation will continue to grow cleaner the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis has released projections suggesting installed renewable electricity capacity could reach 36 gigawatts gw by 2030  building on a 900 increase between 2007 and 2017 it is of course important we continue to use electricity more efficiently in 15 years from now its predicted that power generation could begin to rise significantly and so decarbonising the production of power is arguably just as important as saving it this year will see another flexible 600 megawatt mw coal unit converted to sustainable biomass at drax power station in yorkshire and the first of 84 offshore wind turbines turned on as part of the 588mw beatrice project in the outer moray firth these developments will quicken the pace of decarbonisation in great britains electricity network meaning that positive trend that will continue this is the second story in a series on electricity demand through the ages the first of which looked at the 1970s  tags electricity  investors how did we use electricity in the 70s 8 december 2017 electrification great britains energy mix is arguably in the best place its been in modern times during the second quarter of 2017 56 of our power came from lowercarbon energy sources  this includes renewable nuclear and much of the power imported from france by 2035 its projected that the amount of electricity generated by major power producers from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass could more than double from just over 80 terawatt hours twh in 2016 to almost 180 twh there is still a way to go but the progress weve made is remarkable great britain is now ranked seventh among large economies for electricity decarbonisation its even more impressive when you consider where weve come from just five years ago 38 of the uks electricity was generated from coal between april and august 2017 that share slipped to just 19  and in april 2017 britain went a full 24 hours without using any coal to generate its electricity  the first time this has happened since the industrial revolution if you look even further back however the difference is even more impressive electricity in the 70s welcome to 1970s britain striking workers in the power industry have prompted edward heaths conservative government to put in place the threeday week limiting commercial use of electricity and putting curfews on television broadcasting  since then a lot has changed and this has had a marked effect on how we use electricity for one the uks population has grown by nearly 10 million  more than that the average number of electronic appliances per household has risen from 21 to 50  in 1970 the average household had 16 lighting appliances one cold eg fridges and freezers one wet eg washing machines and dishwashers one cooking appliance and two consumer electronic devices eg a tv and a power supply unit in comparison the average today is 27 lighting two cold two wet 13 consumer electronics three cooking devices and an additional three home computing devices the uk household today is far more reliant on electricity and electrical devices  unsurprisingly this means how much electricity we use has changed total household electricity consumption in 1970 was 2995 ktoe thousand tonnes of oil equivalent in 2015 britain used nearly double  6869 ktoe and while this is a steep rise our electricity use is currently on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2007 at more than 8000 ktoe domestic electricity use has shrunk thanks to more efficient appliances for example an led light bulb can use as much as 80 less electricity than a traditional incandescent one  and can last 25 times longer our overall energy use ie the sources beyond electricity that we use to fuel things like heating and transport has also decreased since 1970 households are using 12 less while the relative decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in the uk means industry now uses 60 less energy than it did in 1970 these gains are slightly offset by our growing love of mobility in 1970 there were around 10 million cars on uk roads now there are around 26 million and we also take a lot more flights which means the transport sector today uses roughly 50 more energy than in 1970 cleaning things up electricity consumption has changed since the 1970s thats no surprise but whats more important is the electricity we use is cleaner than its ever been in 1970 we used 57 million tonnes of coal in power generation every year by 2012 we were using just three million tonnes and during the last four years coal output has fallen 82 instead our electricity is increasingly coming from natural gas plus renewable and low carbon sources a trend set to continue with the maturation of renewables the increasing prevalence of smarter technologies and smarter more efficient electricity grids our energy system is set to remain in a state of positive change a lot of progress has been made over the last 40 years  and its likely to continue over the next 40 this is the first in a series on electricity demand through the ages the second story of which looks at 2018  tags electricity  energy policy every electricity storage technology you need to know about 24 november 2017 power generation the world is generating and using more renewable electricity than ever before but in many cases it is being generated by intermittent  weather dependent  sources like solar and wind while these are imperative to a decarbonised future they cant generate power all the time and this can cause gaps in electricity supply one possible solution is storage if we can store renewable electricity from intermittent sources when they are able to generate it could then be utilised at times when theyre not however the problem is the technology capable of storing electricity at a scale large enough to power a city doesnt existyet the race to develop it is well under way and several companies are working on building ever bigger more efficient electricity storage methods from pumping water up mountains to turning air into liquid here are the emerging storage technologies and some incumbent ones shaping the storage landscape pumped hydropower what if we could power cities with something as simple as gravity and a mountain pumped hydropower storage uses excess electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to a higher one for example up a mountain or hill where it is stored when electricity is needed the water is released from the higher reservoir and runs down the natural incline passing through a typical hydropower turbine to generate electricity pumped hydro is one of the largestcapacity forms of grid power storage and currently accounts for 99 of all bulk storage globally  the bath county pumped storage station in virginia usa is often referred to as the worlds biggest battery and boasts a generation capacity of more than 3 gigawatts gw  which is almost as much as the power output of drax power station or hinkley point c so whats the catch while pumpedhydro storage is efficient and capable of holding huge capacity its major drawback is it requires a suitable mountain or hill to be converted into a giant battery unsurprisingly not every landscape offers one great britain has limited potential  but has a number of pumped storage facilities including the impressive dinorwig in the snowdonia region of wales known as the electric mountain which like drax doubles up as a tourist attraction in december 2018 drax bought cruachan power station the second biggest pumpedhydro storage power station in great britain visit cruachan  the hollow mountain  flywheels and supercapacitors some of the mostrapidly responding forms of energy storage flywheel and supercapacitor storage can both discharge and recharge faster than most conventional forms of batteries the first works by spinning a rotor or flywheel to very high speeds using electrical energy this process creates kinetic energy which is effectively stored within the spinning rotor until its required at which point the kinetic energy is converted back into electricity supercapacitors take a similar approach but store power electrically with the combined properties of a battery and a capacitor they store energy as a static charge but unlike conventional batteries there is no chemical reaction during charging or discharging lithiumion batteries lithiumion batteries are already the goto power source for most home electronics thanks to their highenergy density and low selfdischarge rates but companies are looking to extend their usage by rapidly advancing the technology to take on bigger and better uses most notably electric vehicles evs and providing security of supply to national and regional electricity networks in south australia tesla has just finished installing the worlds biggest lithiumion battery facility  at 100 megawatts mw it will be able to supply 30000 homes for an hour such as when the wind drops and the turbines of the wind farm it is connected to are not producing much power lithiumion batteries are now the most widely used in evs but manufacturers are still facing the challenge of lowering the cost of their manufacture to a point at which to make evs widely accessible tesla has made achieving this a priority establishing its massive gigafactory in nevada to help ramp up production and drop the batteries price a true breakthrough on this point is yet to be reached however solid state batteries the primary complaint for most domestic batteries today be they in smartphones or evs is they just dont last long enough this is where solidstate batteries have a serious advantage using solid electrodes and electrolytes rather than liquid electrolytes used in most commercial batteries solidstate models are smaller cheaper and have a greater energy density than lithiumion batteries they can also be recharged much faster and emit less heat in an ev this can lead to better efficiency lower costs and safer operation the only trouble is the technology isnt quite viable at scale yet dyson and toyota are both putting serious money behind the technology and believe it will be on the market in 2020 hydrogen fuel cells hydrogen is one of the mostabundant elements on earth so its an attractive fuel for any powergeneration technology the latest to emerge is hydrogen fuel cells which are quickly growing in popularity in the automotive space the fuel cells work similarly to batteries with two electrodes separated by an electrolyte however rather than running down and needing recharging hydrogen fuel cells can continue to produce electricity so long as a constant supply of hydrogen and an oxidizer are pumped through it this means a regular supply of hydrogen needs to be fed in to continue to generate power  prompting the rise of fuelling stations where hydrogenpowered cars can be filled up with hydrogen when their batteries have run dry beyond powering cars hydrogen fuel cells have also been used to power buildings and nasa satellites  vehicletogrid systems but what if beyond simply using electricity evs could themselves act as energy storage systems between journeys all cars spend long periods of time stationary vehicletogrid v2g systems can take advantage of this and give evs the ability to discharge their stored electricity for distribution across the grid helping meet demand during peak times in effect cars can become mini power plants nissan and italian energy provider enel have already advanced plans for this sort of system and aim to install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk  evs plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary drax too is involved in this space funding research into v2g systems at sheffield university  smart charging systems will help to automate this giveandtake of electricity further and allow evs to further help reduce overall carbon emissions  compressed air energy compressed air energy storage works similarly to pumped hydropower but instead of pushing water uphill excess electricity is used to compress and store energy underground when electricity is needed the pressurised air is heated which causes it to expand and released driving a turbine behind pumped hydroenergy compressed air is the secondlargest form of energy storage  and is continuously being developed to become more efficient and less dependent on fossil fuels to heat air and similarly to pumped hydro its a sitespecific means of storage compressed air is normally best stored in existing geological formations such as disused hard rock or old salt mines leadacid batteries their technology might be a century and a half old but leadacid batteries are still used today for the simple reason that they still work many decades of development mean leadacid batteries are cheap to produce and highly reliable compared to new innovations in the space today they are most commonly used as car batteries but they have also long served as offgrid storage for solar arrays  their drawbacks include the toxic nature of the chemicals involved and the short lifespan of 300 to 500 cycles however recycling programmes around these leadacid batteries have been so effective that 99 of the batteries in the us were recycled between 2009 and 2013  while moreefficient longer lasting faster charging and lighter batteries are in development leadacid models remain the cheap triedandtested standard for smallscale storage redox flow batteries specifically focusing on renewable energy storage flow batteries are significantly cheaper than lithiumion gridscale storage and offer a longer lifecycle flow batteries consist of two tanks of liquids that are pumped into a reactor where they generate a charge the capacity of the storage facility is therefore determined by the size of the tanks holding their respective liquids which can mean they are bulky and space intensive compared to other gridscale storage systems however flow batteries are more economical suffer lower vulnerabilities and could hold potential to store large amounts of energy for long periods of time  one of the reasons why drax is funding a phd in the area liquid oxygen plant tanks and heat exchange coils the background a factory liquefied air what more abundant resource to use for energy storage than the air around us by cooling air down to 196 o c it is turned into a compressed liquid which can be stored when ambient air is exposed to this liquid it regasifies and expands in volume rapidly rotating a turbine in the process one of the main advantages of this form of storage is its potentially high capacity  an impressive 700 litres of ambient air can be reduced to just one litre of liquid air more than this there is potential for it to become even more efficient by using waste heat and cold from industrial process such as thermal generation plants steel milling or the creation of liquefied natural gas lng uk company highview power storage is currently trialling the technology at the

includes plans for up to 200 mw of storage  and imperial college londons grantham institute on climate change and the environment produced this detailed infographic comparing the benefits and challenges faced by energy storage technologies  tags energy storage  electric vehicles evs  electricity the silent force that moves electricity 31 august 2017 power generation in the early evening of 14 th august 2003 new york city in the midst of a heatwave lost its power  offices stores transport networks wall street and the un building all found their lights and phones cut off gridlocked streets and a stalled subway system forced millions to commute home on foot while those unable to make it back to the suburbs set up camp around the city it wasnt just the big apple facing blackout  what had started with several power lines in northern ohio brushing against an overgrown tree had spread in eight minutes to affect eight us states and two canadian provinces in total more than 50 million people were impacted 6 billion was lost in damages and 12 deaths were reported while a software glitch and the outdated nature of the power system contributed to the disaster the spread from a few highvoltage power lines to the entire north west was caused by a lack of reactive power  the pump powering electricity electricity that turns on light bulbs and charges phones is whats known as active power  usually measured in watts w kilowatts kw megawatts mw or in even higher units however getting that active power around the energy system efficiently economically and safely requires something called reactive power which is used to pump active power around the grid reactive power is measured in mega volt amps reactive  mvar  its generated in the same way as active power by large power stations but is fed into the system in a slightly different manner which leads to limitations on how far it can travel reactive power can only be effective locallyregionally  it does not travel far so across the country there are regional reactive power distributors servicing each local area imagine a long hose pipe that needs individual pumps at certain points along the way to provide the thrust necessary to transport water but power stations arent the only source of reactive power some electronic devices like laptops and tvs actually produce and feed small amounts of reactive power back into the grid in large numbers this increases the amount of reactive power on the grid and when this happens power stations must absorb the excess this is because although its essential to have reactive power on the grid it is more important to have the right amount too much and power lines can become overloaded which creates volatility on the network such as in the new york blackout too little and efficiency decreases think once again of the long hose pipe  if the pressure is too great the hose is at risk of bursting if the pressure is too low water wont travel through it properly this process of managing reactive power is at its heart one of ensuring active power is delivered to the places it needs to be but it is also one of voltage control  a delicate balancing act that if not closely monitored can lead to serious problems keeping volatility at bay across britain all electricity on the national grid must run at the same voltage either 400kv or 275kv  it is stepped down from 132kv to 230v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to equipment being damaged or large scale blackouts national grid monitors and manages the nationwide voltage level to ensure it remains within the safe limit and doing this relies on managing reactive power ian foy head of ancillary services at drax explains when cables are lightly loaded with a low level of power running through them such as overnight when electricity demand is lower they start emitting reactive power causing the voltage to rise to counter this generators such as drax power station  under instruction from national grid can change the conditions in their transformers from exporting to absorbing reactive power in just two minutes this relies on 24hour coordination across the national grid but as our power system continues to evolve so do our reactive power requirements and this is partly down to the economys move from heavy industry to business and consumer services the changing needs for reactive power large industrial power loads such as those required for big motors mills or coal mines bring voltage down and create a demand for more reactive power explains foy now with more consumer product usage the demand for active power is falling and the voltage is rising the result is that drax and other power stations now spend more time absorbing reactive power rather than exporting it to keep voltage levels down in the past by contrast foy says the power plant would export reactive energy during the day and absorb it at night as britains energy system decarbonises the load on powerlines also becomes lighter as more and more decentralised power sources such as wind and solar are used to meet local demand rather than large power plants supplying wider areas this falling load on the power system increases the voltage and creates a greater need for generators to absorb reactive power from the system it

national grid  investors  electricity what hot weather means for electricity 29 august 2017 power generation during the penultimate week of june 2017 temperatures of thirty degrees celsius or more were recorded across the uk for five days straight it was the hottest continuous spell of weather in the country since the 70s and while this may sound like a minor headline its evidence of an important fact the world is getting warmer  according to the met office experiencing a very hot summer is now likely to occur every five years rather than every 50 by the 2040s more extreme heatwaves could become commonplace  and this could have serious consequences the extreme heatwave that hit europe in 2003 led to a death toll in the tens of thousands and placed extreme strain on the continent  not only on its people but on its infrastructure too if this weather is set to continue what does it mean for our electricity network electricity in extreme weather in hot countries electricity use soars in times of extreme weather due to increased use of cooling devices like air conditioning one us study predicted an extreme temperature upswing could drive as much as an 72 increase in us peak demand in northern europe including the uk where air conditioning is less prevalent  the effects of heat arent as pronounced but that could change in france hot weather is estimated to have contributed to a 2 gw increase in demand this june the uk which has traditionally only seen demand swings due to cold weather  is also beginning to feel the effects of extreme heat according to dr iain staffell of imperial college london for every degree rise in temperature during june 2017 electricity demand rose by 09 300 mw for example on 19 th june when temperature averaged 219 degrees celsius demand reached 32 gw on the 25 th  when temperatures dropped to an average of 159 degrees demand shrank to 266 gw in the very hottest days of summer this can mean the grid needs to deliver an additional 15 gw of power  equivalent to the output of five rapidresponse gas power stations or twoandahalf biomass units at drax power station and while heats effect on demand is considerable its not the only one it has on electricity the problem of cooling water in hot weather generating power doesnt just need fuel its also a waterintensive process power stations consume water for two main reasons to turn into steam to drive generation turbines and to cool down machinery both rely on raising the temperature of the water however this water cant simply be released back into a river or lake after use  even if nothing has been added to it  as warm water can negatively affect wildlife living in these habitats first it has to be cooled  normally via cooling towers  but in hot weather this takes longer and as a result power production becomes less efficient and in some cases plant output must be dialled back this had serious consequences for frances nuclear power plants during the 2003 heatwave these plants  which provide roughly 75 of the countrys electricity  draw water from nearby rivers to cool their reactors during the heatwave however these rivers were both too hot and too low to safely provide water for the cooling process which in turn led to the power stations having to either close or drastically reduce capacity coupled with increased demand france was left on the verge of a largescale black out situations like this are even more critical when considering heats effects on electricitys motorway the national grid how the hot weather impacts electricity when materials get hot they expand  this includes those electricity grids are made from for example overhead power transmission cables are often clad in aluminium which is particularly susceptible to expansion in heat when it expands overhead lines can slacken and sag which increases electrical resistance in the cables  leading to a drop in efficiency transformers which step up and down voltage across grids are also susceptible they give off heat as a byproduct of their operations but to keep them within a safe level of operation they have whats known as a power rating  the highest temperature at which they can safely function when ambient temperatures rise this ceiling gets lower and their efficiency drops  about 1 for every one degree celsius gain in temperature at scale this can have a significant effect overall grids can lose about 1 in efficiency for every three degrees hotter it gets as global temperatures continue to rise these challenges could grow more acute at uk power stations such as drax important upgrade and maintenance work takes place during the quieter summer months if this period becomes one in which there is a higher demand for power at peak times it could lead to new challenges investing in infrastructure and building a power generation landscape that includes a mix of technologies and meets a variety of grid needs is one way in which we can counter the challenges of climate change this will mean we can not only move towards a lower carbon economy and contribute towards slowing global warming but respond to climate change by adapting essential national infrastructure to deal with its effects tags temperature  investors  electricity why we need the whole country on the same frequency 23 june 2017 power generation the modern world sits on a volatile fizzing web of electricity in 2015 the uk consumed roughly 303 terawatt hours twh of electricity according to government statistics  thats an awful lot of power humming around and in this country we take it for granted that electricity is controlled this means the power supply coming into your home or place of work is reliable and wont trip your fuse box in short it means your mobile phone will keep on charging and your washing machine will keep on spinning but generating and circulating electricity at safe usable levels is not an easy task one of the most overlooked aspects of doing this is electrical frequency  and how its regulated what is electrical frequency to understand the importance of frequency we need to understand a couple of important things about power generation generators work by converting the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine into electrical energy in a steamdriven generator like those at drax power station  high pressure steam turns a turbine which turns a rotor mounted inside a stator copper wire is wound around the rotor energised with electricity this turns it into an electromagnet with a north and south pole the stator is made up of large heavy duty copper bars which enclose the rotor as the rotor turns its magnetic field passes through the copper bars and induces an electric current which is sent out onto the transmission system as the magnetic field has a north and south pole the copper bars experience a change in direction of the magnetic field each time the rotor turns this makes the electric current change direction twice per revolution and is called an alternating current ac there are in fact three sets of copper bars in the stator producing three electrical outputs or phases termed red yellow and blue electrical frequency is the measure of the rate of that oscillation and is measured in the number of changes per second  also called hertz hz a generator running at 3000 rpm  with two magnetic poles produces electricity at a frequency of 50hz why is this important maintaining a consistent electrical frequency is important because multiple frequencies cannot operate alongside each other without damaging equipment this has serious implications when providing electricity at a national scale the exact figure is less important than the need to keep frequency stable across all connected systems in great britain the grid frequency is 50hz in the us its 60hz in japan the western half of the country runs at 60hz and the eastern half of the country runs at 50hz  a string of power stations across the middle of the country steps up and down the frequency of the electricity as it flows between the two grids sticking to one national frequency is a team effort every generator in england scotland and wales connected to the high voltage transmission system is synchronised to every other generator when the output of any of the three phases  the red yellow or blue  is at a peak the output from all other phases of the same colour on every other generating unit in great britain is also at a peak they are all locked together  synchronised  to form a single homogenous supply which provides stability and guaranteed quality how is frequency managed the problem is frequency can be difficult to control  if the exact amount of electricity being used is not matched by generation it can affect the frequency of the electricity on the grid for example if theres more demand for electricity than there is supply frequency will fall if there is too much supply frequency will rise to make matters more delicate theres a very slim margin of error in great britain anything just 1 above or below the standard 50hz risks damaging equipment and infrastructure  see how far the countrys frequency is currently deviating from 50 hz  managing electrical frequency falls to a countrys high voltage transmission system operator the national grid in the uk the grid can instruct power generators like drax to make their generating units automatically respond to changes in frequency if the frequency rises the turbine reduces its steam flow if it falls it will increase changing the electrical output  a change that needs to happen in seconds in the case of generating units at drax power station the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension which minimises large frequency swings frequency on a fastchanging system not all power generation technologies are suited for providing high quality frequency response roles and as the uk transitions to a lowercarbon economy ancillary services such as stabilisation of frequency are becoming more important neither solar nor wind can be as easily controlled its possible to regulate wind output down or hold back wind turbines to enable upward frequency response when there is sufficient wind similarly solar panels can be switched on and off to simulate frequency response as solar farms are so widely dispersed and tend to be embedded  meaning they operate outside of the national system it is not as easy for national grid to instruct and monitor them both wind and solar have no inertia so the allimportant damping effect is missing too using these intermittent or weatherdependent power generation technologies to help manage frequency can be expensive compared to thermal power stations nor are the current fleet of nuclear reactors flexible  nuclear reactors in great britain were designed to run continuously at high loads known as a baseload power although they cannot deliver frequency response services the countrys nuclear power stations do provide inertia twenty times faster thermal power generation technologies such as renewable biomass or fossil fuels such as coal and gas are ideal for frequency response services at scale because they can be easily dialled up or down as both the fuel supply to their boilers and steam within their turbines can be regulated the 645 mw thermal power units at drax have the capability to respond to the grids needs in as little as half a second or less complete their change in output in under one second and maintain their response for many minutes or even hours before the introduction of high volumes of wind and solar generation almost all generators excluding nuclear running on the system could provide frequency response as these generators are increasingly replaced by intermittent technologies the system operator must look for new services to maintain system stability an example is national grids recent enhanced frequency response tender which asked for a solution that can deliver frequency stabilisation in under a second  20 times faster than the primary response provided by existing thermal power stations drax was the only participating thermal power station however all contracts were all won by battery storage projects frequency future given the decline in fossil fuel generation and uncertainty around our power makeup in future decades national grid is consulting on how best to source services such as frequency response the ideal scenario for national grid is one where services can be increasingly sourced from reliable flexible and affordable forms of low carbon generation or demand response the next generation of nuclear power stations as with some already operating in france can provide frequency response services however the first of the new crop hinkley c is around a decade away from being operational  likewise solar or wind coupled with battery molten salt or flywheel storage will provide an increasing level of flexibility in the decades ahead as storage costs come down thanks to power generation at drax with compressed wood pellets  a form of sustainable biomass britain has already begun moving into an era where lower carbon frequency response can begin to form the foundation
