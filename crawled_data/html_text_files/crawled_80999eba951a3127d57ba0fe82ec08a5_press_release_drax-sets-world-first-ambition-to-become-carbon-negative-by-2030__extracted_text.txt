jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth says ceo will gardiner 10 december 2019 drax will be the first company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 when ceo will gardiner speaks at cop 25 in madrid on tuesday december 10 2019 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax will remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces creating a negative carbon footprint for the company draxs ambition is only achievable with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework the uk government is developing those as part of its global leadership in addressing the climate crisis leading british energy company drax group plc will be the first company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative when ceo will gardiner speaks at a powering past coal alliance event at cop 25 in madrid today tuesday december 10 2019 he will say that drax has an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 but doing so will depend on an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework for new technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload being carbon negative means that drax will be removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces throughout its operations  creating a negative carbon footprint for the company within a decade drax is already running a successful beccs pilot at its power station capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide every day the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the uk committee on climate change agree that beccs is critical to achieving netzero carbon emissions by 2050 sustainable biomass is an important part of the uks longterm energy mix combining this renewable fuel with carbon capture and storage technology on draxs biomass generating units at its power station in north yorkshire england means the groups operations could capture 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year or more  a significant proportion of the uks target drax ceo will gardiner said draxs ambition is to be carbon negative by 2030 having pioneered the use of sustainable biomass drax now produces 12 of the uks renewable electricity with the right negative emissions policy we can do much more removing millions of tonnes of emissions from the atmosphere each year drax ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click image to viewdownload the uk government is working on a policy and investment framework to encourage negative emissions technologies which will enable the uk to be home to the worlds first carbon negative company this is not just critical to beating the climate crisis but also to enabling a just transition protecting jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth  delivering for the economy as well as for the environment in recent years drax has undergone a worldleading transformation becoming europes largest decarbonisation project by converting twothirds of its coalfired power station to use sustainable biomass in the first half of 2019 94 of the power produced by drax power station in north yorkshire england was renewable  delivering carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when it only used coal the engineering skill and expertise at drax which enabled this unique transformation is now pioneering groundbreaking negative emissions technologies earlier this year drax became the only power generator in the world to have captured carbon dioxide from a 100 biomass feedstock using beccs technology through its successful pilot project after closing its remaining two coal generating units at drax power station by 2025 and using carbon capture technology on its biomass power generating units its operations would become carbon negative by 2030 will gardiner will announce draxs ambition when he speaks at cop25 in madrid drax is a member of the powering past coal alliance an initiative launched by the uk and canadian governments which seeks to end the use of unabated coal in power stations around the world by 2030 the powering past coal alliance wants to accelerate the transition away from unabated coal and drax is supporting its work to encourage members to scale up their ambitions and to create more collaboration helping prospective new members to move forwards in using cleaner energy ends media contacts selina williams drax group media manager e email protected t 44 07912 230393 ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 44 07712 670888 notes to editors drax ceo will gardiner will speak at the powering past coal alliance event at cop 25 in madrid on tuesday december 10 2019 at 550pm local time 450pm gmt his speech will be published on the drax website afterwards  achieving draxs ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 is dependent upon it closing its two remaining coal generating units at drax power station which it plans to do by 2025  consistent with the uk governments objectives having at least two biomass generating units operating with beccs technology running at 90 availability capturing and storing eight million tonnes of co 2 a year this would more than compensate for draxs projected co 2 emissions from its other operations in 2030 drax has included all harmful greenhouse gases as defined by the kyoto protocol in its calculations the greenhouse gas protocol corporate standard classifies a companys greenhouse gas emissions into three scopes scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions not included in scope 2 that occur in the value chain of the reporting company including both upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions are not included in draxs calculations for achieving its carbon negative status in 2030 this is in line with accepted practice globally based on the greenhouse gas protocol however had its sustainable biomass supply chain emissions been included drax would still be a carbon negative company in 2030 drax has signed up to the un global compact science based targets which provides companies with a clearly defined pathway to futureproof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions the target is aligned to the pathway which limits global temperature rise to 15c below preindustrial levels the uk government is currently developing an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework drax believes this should include a regulated asset base rab based model to support transport and storage contract for difference to support beccs and other negative emissions technologies support for multiple carbon capture clusters in the uk including zero carbon humber in september 2019 the uk government published a report it commissioned from vivid economics an economic consultancy considering how the uk could deliver up to 130 million tonnes of negative emissions required to achieve net zero by 2050 the report recommended a suite of short and longterm government actions including strengthening existing payment schemes for afforestation and habitation restoration introducing an obligation on fossil fuel suppliers to fund negative emissions technologies amending the existing contracts for difference support scheme in the electricity sector for beccs and direct air capture projects drax announced it had captured the first carbon dioxide from its pioneering beccs pilot project earlier this year the uk committee on climate changes  net zero  report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero drax launched the zero carbon humber campaign in september with partners equinor and national grid ventures aimed at creating the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster in the region drax could use beccs across all four of its biomass generating units capturing 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year as the worlds first negative emissions power station it could be the anchor for a net zero industrial cluster in the humber region  protecting thousands of jobs delivering clean growth and new export opportunities for the region all major uk political parties have now committed to develop at least one industrial carbon capture storage cluster drax signed up
