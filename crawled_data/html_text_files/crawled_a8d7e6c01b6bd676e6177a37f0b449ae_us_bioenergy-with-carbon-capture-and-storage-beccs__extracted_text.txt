transport contact us bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs capture the opportunity beccs is the most scalable and affordable carbon removal technology available and can be deployed quickly  playing a key role in achieving net zero by 2050 what is beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co2 that is generated during the production of electricity from sustainable biomass this is the only carbon removal technology that also generates low carbon renewable power us opportunities for carbon removals beccs is increasingly being explored and deployed around the world at heat and power stations factories and wastetoenergy plants as countries and organisations aim to achieve net zero through negative emissions the us is ramping up their research and development of beccs the landmark inflation reduction act demonstrated the vital need for biomass and beccs in the view of the us government beccs by drax can help the us provide climate leadership quickly and affordably by enabling the rapid procurement of renewable 247 baseload electricity and capturing carbon from the atmosphere us beccs by drax carbon removals by drax why is beccs important for decarbonisation the us will need to remove 08 to 2 billion metric tonnes of carbon by 2050 to do its share of tackling climate change given the scale of the challenge and whats at stake experts everywhere including the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the california air resources board carb and the us government agree that to reach net zero we must remove dangerous levels of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere unlike the linear irreversible process of emitting carbon from fossil fuels sustainable biomass exists in a closed carbon cycle by adding carbon capture and storage technology the carbon cycle is broken instead of being released into the atmosphere carbon is transported and stored in a secure geological formation underground producing whats known as an engineered carbon dioxide removal princeton net zero america project final report 2020page 34 the first beccs by drax facility in the us will 3mt remove 3 million tonnes mt of carbon from the atmosphere 1000 jobs estimates suggest that a project will create around 1000 permanent direct jobs from plant operations and across the forest value chain 2twh

viewdownload click to viewdownload click to viewdownload frequently asked questions what is beccs how does beccs achieve negative emissions is beccs a proven technology is beccs sustainable will beccs at drax create any new jobs how will beccs be funded how will the captured carbon be stored click to viewdownload beccs is an innovative technology that has been developed to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere beccs provides negative emissions as well as stable renewable electricity and will play a vital role in tackling the climate crisis and supporting energy security what is beccs negative emissions are created when you permanently remove more co2 from the atmosphere than is created across your operations with beccs flue gases are produced when sustainable biomass is used to generate renewable electricity these gasses are captured through a chemical reaction the captured co2 is then stored permanently in deposits such as saline aquifers found under the sea the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative as more co 2 has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added what are negative emissions yes drax has been testing a number of carbon capture technologies since our first trail began in 2018 carbon capture technology is not new and has been used in the fossil fuel and oil  gas industries for many years there are currently 26 ccs facilities operating worldwide with a further 39 either planned or under construction research commissioned by drax shows there is enough sustainable biomass available globally to support beccs projects to capture up to 4gt of co 2 without adversely impacting forest health biodiversity or food security this is equivalent to four times the annual co 2 emissions from commercial aviation learn more about sustainable biomass beccs by drax offers a decarbonisation route that protects and creates jobs retaining highquality jobs and boosting local economies in the us preliminary estimates suggest that a project will create around 1000 permanent direct jobs from plant operations and across the forest value chain and an additional 3500 indirect and induced jobs supported throughout the supply chain supporting thousands of jobs during the construction phase beccs careers in the current energy crisis and economic climate its vital that new projects such as beccs provide cost effective solutions that not only support energy security but also deliver on net zero targets by having the right policies which incentivise investment we could see a repeat of the success seen with the cfds for offshore wind  that sector has reached grid parity and no longer requires subsidies a recent uk report commissioned by drax by consultancy frontier economics looked into the optimum funding methods that would allow negative emissions technologies like beccs be delivered cost effectively beccs delivery captured carbon can be safely and permanently injected deep underground into naturally occurring porous rock formations the carbon is trapped in multiple ways structurallyanimpermeable caprock above the reservoir stops co2 migrating back to the surface in solution  porous rocks often contain salty water which co2 dissolves into residually  as tiny isolated bubbles in the pore space of the rock as a mineral  co2 can react with the surrounding rock creating new solid minerals how do
