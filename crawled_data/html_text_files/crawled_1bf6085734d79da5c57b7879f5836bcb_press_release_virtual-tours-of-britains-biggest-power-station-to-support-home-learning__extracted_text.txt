support their studies the virtual tours weve created builds on the work weve already done to provide laptops and free internet access to ensure no students are left behind during the lockdown over the last decade the power stations worldclass engineers have upgraded two thirds of its generating units to use biomass  sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets  in place of coal transforming the plant to become the uks largest renewable power generator producing enough electricity for four million homes drax group the owner of the power station recently announced a worldleading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 through pioneering new negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at the site the first in the series of virtual online tours shows viewers how fuels are used to generate electricity where draxs sustainable biomass comes from and how beccs could be deployed to tackle climate change ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes the tours will be available on drax groups youtube channel and facebook drax group was the first company in the world to announce an ambitions to become carbon negative by 2030  through using beccs at scale around 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide could be captured at drax power station a significant proportion of the negative emissions required for the uk to reach its zero carbon targets about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax supplies energy to 250000 businesses across england scotland and wales pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks
