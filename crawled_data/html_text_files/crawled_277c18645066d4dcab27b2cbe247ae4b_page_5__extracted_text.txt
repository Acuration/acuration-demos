facility deep in the expanding forestland of the southeastern usa it passes through a set of gates over a massive scale then onto a metal platform the driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console slowly the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises as it does the trucks cargo empties into a large container behind it two minutes later its empty this is how you unload a wood fuel truck at drax biomass compressed wood pellet plants in louisiana and mississippi  what is a tipper some people call them truck dumpers but it depends on who you talk to says jim stemple senior director of procurement at drax biomass we just call it the tipper regardless of what its called what the tipper does is easy to explain it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently the sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the atlantic however at industrial facilities in the united states its more common tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn grain and gravel stemple explains basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping both of drax biomass two operational pellet facilities a third is currently idle while being upgraded use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark  known in the forestry industry as hog fuel which is used to heat the plants wood chip dryers  sawdust and raw wood chips which are used to make the compressed wood pellets  how does it work the tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other to ensure safety each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end where the load is emptying from so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long once tipped far enough each platform tips to a roughly 60degree angle the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for one way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles  which then goes through the pelleting process of the hammer mills the dryer and the pellet mill says stemple the other way takes it to the fuel pile which goes to the furnace the furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 115 and 12 before they go through the pelleting process if everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour says stemple from full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load efficiency benefits using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach but its also an efficient one firstly theres the speed it allows multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour and because cargo is delivered straight into the system theres no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system secondly for the truck owners the benefits are they dont need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks instead its just the tipper  one piece of equipment  which is maintained to keep operations on track however there is one thing drivers need to be wary of what they leave in their driver cabins open coffee cups food containers  anything not firmly secured  all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play i guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once stemple says the first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time tags biomass energy  investors  technology  transport  wood pellets forests sustainability and biomass  the experts view matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 6 october 2016 opinion it was a forestry catastrophe that first inspired matthew rivers interest in forests dutch elm trees an iconic part of the uk landscape for over 250 years were becoming infected with a fatal and fastspreading disease the race was on to save them a schoolboy in north london at the time rivers joined the after curricular school team tasked with saving its trees  first by injecting them with insecticide and when that didnt work by felling and replanting them it was an early foundation in how forests work and the challenges of keeping them healthy decades later rivers is director of corporate affairs at drax its a role he finds himself in following a career as a forester helping to manage forestry businesses and supporting the setting up of wood product manufacturing plants his own estimation of his working life is a humble one however i think im probably a failed farmer he says a forester always plants in hope rivers studied forestry at university in scotland before taking up jobs in the forestry industry across the uk uruguay and finland working in this industry he says is one that requires patience in the uk were talking about 30 or 40year growth cycles the trees i planted at the start of my career are only just coming to maturity now he explains but more than the long investment of time being a forester relies on faith a forester always plants in hope he says when a forester plants a tree he or she most commonly does not know who the end customer will be so when the call came from drax for a forestry expert to help guide the company through an important transformation  upgrading the power station from coal to biomass  the challenge was one he was ready to take drax already had ambitions of converting three boilers to run on biomass that would mean consuming tonnes of compressed wood pellets he says the business needed a supply and rivers was drafted in to set this up as part of the supply solution and chaired by rivers drax set up drax biomass  a pellet manufacturing business in the usa that makes and supplies compressed wood pellets to drax power station  setting up its own manufacturing plant not only means drax needs to rely on fewer external suppliers but also that it can use the learnings about the technologies the economics and the sourcing of the process to continually hone its supply chain to operate responsibly and receive governmental support drax has to be sustainable and this is particularly important when it comes to where and how it sources its fuel this comes with its own challenges no universal definition of sustainability to my understanding there is no universal definition of sustainability says rivers so how do you proof your business for an unclear entity at its heart sustainability is about not doing anything today that would prejudice doing the same thing for the next generation or generations to come a responsibly managed forest is one that is as healthy productive diverse and useful in 100 or 500 years time as it is today they key to this is to think of forests as a whole rivers explains think about a single tree  you fell it and use it to heat your home over one winter but its going to take perhaps 30 years for that tree to grow back he says what do you do for the next 30 years in a sustainably managed forest you have all different ages of tree represented  one thirtieth devoted to each age and when you use an older tree to warm you in winter you plant a replacement that way for every year youll have trees reaching maturity ready to provide your power its a cycle that if managed responsibly keeps delivering a useful resource as well as maintaining the health of the forest rivers continues sustainability is the very nature of what a forester does because if we dont take care of our forests and ensure we have a crop to harvest year after year we lose our livelihood becoming a private forester two decades ago rivers completed a loop he started decades ago amidst the dutch elm crisis and became a forest owner himself in scotland he bought and now manages his own private forest weve had kids birthday parties weve dug out a pond we harvest chanterelles in the autumn  theres a millennium capsule buried somewhere he says its not only a family heirloom its a place for him to exercise a passion  maintaining and managing a responsible and healthy forest tags biomass energy  careers  sustainability  wood pellets this is how you make a biomass wood pellet sustainable bioenergy wood has been used as fuel for tens of thousands of years but this wood  a compressed wood pellet  is different its the size of a childs crayon and weighs next to nothing but when combined with many more it is a smart solution to generating cleaner electricity compared to coal wood pellets like these are being used at drax power station to generate electricity and power cities not only are they renewable and sustainable but because they are compressed dried and made from incredibly fine wood fibres theyre also a very efficient fuel for power stations this is how a compressed wood pellet is made at the drax biomass amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi the wood arrives to the yard wood arrives at the plant via truck and is sent to one of four places the wood storage yard the wood circle where wood is primed for processing the piles of sawdust and woodchip or straight into processing bark is removed and kept for fuel logs are fed into a debarker machine which beats the logs together inside a large drum to remove the bark the bark is put aside and used to fuel the woodchip dryer used later in the process thinned wood stems become small chips the logs  lowvalue fibre from sustainably managed working forests  need to be cut down into even smaller pieces so they can then be shredded into the fine material needed for creating pellets inside the wood chipper multiple blades spin and cut the logs into chips roughly 10mm long and 3mm thick the resulting chips are fed into the woodchip pile ready for screening chips are screened for quality and waste is removed chipped down wood can include waste elements like sand remaining bark or stones that can affect pellet production the chips are passed through a screener that removes the waste leaving only ideal sized wood chips the biggest hairdryer youve ever seen the wood chips need to have a moisture level of between 115 and 12 before they go into the pelleting process anything other than this and the quality of the resulting pellets could be compromised the chips enter a large drum which is blasted with hot air generated in a heater powered by bark collected from the debarker the chips are moved through the drum by a large fan ready for the hammer mill small woodchips become even smaller woodchips inside the hammer mill theres a spinning shaft mounted with a series of hammers the wood chips are fed into the top of the drum and the spinning hammers chip and shred them down into a fine powdery substance that is used to create the pellets putting the chips under pressure  a lot of pressure the shredded woodchip powder is fed into the pellet mill inside a rotating arm presses the powdered wood fibre through a grate featuring a number of small holes the intense pressure heats up the wood fibre and helps it bind together as it passes through the holes in a metal ring dye forming the compressed wood pellets resting and cooling down fresh pellets from the mill are damp and hot and need to rest and cool before transporting off site theyre moved to large storage silos kept at low temperatures so the pellets can cool and harden ready for shipping one of the biggest domes youve ever seen this is the final stage before shipping specially designed and constructed storage domes are used to store the wood pellets after they are transported to the mississippi river louisiana and before they make their way across the atlantic to the uk tags about us  biomass energy  power station  technology  wood pellets inside the dome sustainable bioenergy there are four storage domes at drax power station and each of them can hold 80000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets its these biomass pellets a sustainable fuel that drax is being upgraded to run on and produce renewable electricity wood pellets are an incredible fuel that can match coal for efficiency  the challenge is you just need more of them as the density and calorific value of coal is greater however storing such large quantities in a confined space presents risks that have to be managed 247 atmospheric control the crucial difficulty with storing the pellets is their chemical volatility wood which the pellets are made from emit carbon monoxide co in a confined space such as the storage dome this co can build up and  due to cos extreme flammability  require the entire internal atmosphere to be regulated by a set of highly sophisticated engineering solutions as long as materials are emitting more heat into the atmosphere than they are storing in themselves there is no risk of combustion a single wood pellet in a fuel store poses no fire risk nor does a small pile but when thousands upon thousands are piled together the pressure builds up and causes the pellets to heat up gradually the rate of temperature increase speeds up and before you know the flashpoint threshold has been crossed and theres potential for danger however remove or limit the oxygen supply in the silo and purge the co thats emitted from the pellets and the risk of a thermal event is substantially reduced the challenge for the engineers at drax constructing the domes was finding a way to manage temperatures within the dome neutral nitrogen to do this they created a system to automatically inject nitrogen into the storage dome while nitrogen isnt a truly inert gas it is much less reactive than co and oxygen with this pumped into the domes atmosphere it is a much safer environment to get a steady supply of nitrogen regular air from our atmosphere  which is 78 nitrogen  is passed through a molecular filter which removes the larger oxygen molecules the gas collected at the other end is 96 nitrogen this nitrogenrich air is then injected from underneath the dome and continually distributed around it not only is this a fire prevention method but also a firefighting one that can be pumped in larger quantities in the event of combustion separate to the above measures which are there to manage fuel temperatures the dome is also fitted with a carbon dioxide co2 injection system and water deluge system which are there as fire extinguishing precautions the big ear inside the dome the next problem facing the designers was how to accurately monitor the quantity of compressed wood pellets inside the dome to achieve this each dome is fitted with a sonar system  which sounds a bit like a chirping bird  that provides continuous feedback on how full the dome is the sonar monitoring system provides level profile and volume information which is translated into a 3d image of the stored biomass this method of volumunetric measurement allows the operators to view and monitor in real time the effects of their actions when filling and unloading domes so they can target specific areas particularly when unloading and for fuel accounting purposes other tools and tricks five thermocouple arrays measure the pile temperature and provide feedback in real time to the operators to allow them to assess the status of the dome and effectively plan material filling and reclaim gas monitors measure the levels of co and co2 as well as o2 depletion within the head space of the dome a dome breather vent a two way acting valve which as its name suggests allows the dome to breathe is fitted to the top of the dome and acts as a vacuum breaker maintaining a relatively even pressure allowing air in during unloading and releasing head space gasses during nitrogen inserting the final piece of the atmospheric control puzzle is regulating pressure at the top of each dome is a controllable aperture called a slide gate which is closed unless the dome is being filled to allow material to enter a dome aspiration system is installed here to filter and remove displaced air from within the head space during filling but also allow a route for co and other offgassing products to escape all the hidden systems within these four huge white domes allow the operator to effectively control their atmospheric conditions and crucially to store massive amounts of potentially volatile biomass safely on site find out more about these giant storage domes  read the story about how they were constructed  tags biomass energy  engineering  technology  wood pellets the single biggest transformation of our century sustainable bioenergy at the turn of the millennium drax was facing a serious issue demand for electricity was high and increasing but so was the desire for sources of power that were less harmful to the environment than coal at that time draxs fuel to continue to meet demand in a cleaner and more sustainable way an alternative approach was needed drax had a legacy in this field  in 1988 it was the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions in the two decades that followed however the sustainability conversation moved beyond how to make coal cleaner instead the focus was finding a truly viable alternative fuel finding a new fuel in those early days the idea of converting a fully coalfired station to another fuel seemed outlandish to say the least we made a lot of peoples heads hurt with this project says drax strategic projects engineering manager jason shipstone no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going back then it was all about experimentation jim price alternative fuel manager at the time explains initially we found a few distressed cargos of wood pellets and sunflower husks that someone had ordered but didnt want we mixed that with coal at very low concentration price and his team found they could use the plantbased fuel alongside coal at low percentages without it detrimentally affecting the boilers it was a long way from being a new business model but it was a start they spent the next year working with willow wood a subsidized energy crop that proved difficult to turn into a fuel that could be used efficiently to power a boiler then in 2005 after building a prototype plant and finding a way to pulverise the willow into a fine powder  called wood flour  and combine it with coal dust the team hit its first key milestone it was able to power a drax boiler that was the eureka moment says price no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going a change in attitude the response to the success was immediate senior management support for the project had been in place from the beginning but now there was a change across the whole company people started to think maybe it can be done says price work continued on the project and  after more experiments  drax eventually settled on compressed wood pellets this form of biomass ultimately required investment in four vast storage domes that between them store 80000 tonnes of pellets then there was the issue of supply and delivery materials were sourced from the us shipped to the uk then freighted to the plant in specially designed covered train wagons each carrying up to 7600 tonnes everything else had to carry on as normal this had to be seamless we had to work the same as drax has always worked  reliable and available says shipstone jason shipstone drax strategic projects manager played an instrumental role in upgrading drax the final hurdle in 2009 the team overcame one of the final challenges and successfully adapted the boilers to combust the new fuel proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels powering one boiler  in this case wood pellets and coal could work it was enough to show there was a future in wood pellets and it could work at scale although nothing was fully built yet but dorothy thompson ceo of drax was convinced shipstone remembers the conversation after thompson signed the contract to begin the transition in earnest so we can do 10 what does it take to get to 50 she asked recalls shipstone his response no problem it was the right answer he says toward a coalfree future fast forward to 2016 and drax is europes largest decarbonisation project  reducing emissions by at least 80 of the 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that the three now converted former coal generation units would have released per year although only half of draxs six units have been upgraded from coal to use compressed wood pellets  65 of the electricity generated at the power station is the result of a renewable rather than a fossil fuel its three biomass units produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes  or more than half of all residential properties in northern england given the challenges the world faces regarding the future of energy production decisive action is required if were to meet carbon reduction targets in the uk the government has voiced ambitions of phasing out coal by 2025 drax has aims of doing it quicker thompson has spoken of plans that see all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before the story of energy since the dawn of the industrial revolution has been one of fossil fuels this simply has to change by finding a way to ease the transition away from coal drax is helping to write the next chapter tags engineering  history  power station  technology  wood pellets the biggest balls of electricity generation power generation when making a cup of tea its unlikely you consider the industrial equipment kicked into action the moment you switch on your kettle and of all of the activity going on behind the scenes its even more unlikely you think about a 12tonne steel ball but without a number of 12tonne balls and the electricity they help generate your kettle would be nothing more than a fancy jug how do giant balls help to generate power the answer lies in the way fuels like coal and compressed wood pellets are used to power boilers and generate electricity drax started its life as a coal power station but today it is in the process of upgrading to run on biomass progress has already been made  three of the stations six units already run on compressed wood pellets draxs biomass fuel generating around 20 of the uks renewable electricity to generate enough power to supply 8 of the uks demand  as drax does  a lot of fuel is needed hundreds of thousands of wood pellets are delivered to drax every day arriving on custombuilt trains travelling from the ports of tyne hull immingham and liverpool the pellets pass through a system of conveyor belts until they arrive at one of four massive conical storage domes  located on site in yorkshire before the wood pellets can be converted into fuel they need to be crushed this is where the balls come into play the pulveriser the wood pellets used at drax are compressed and dried wood that is formed into small capsules the size of a childs crayon  but like with coal to get the best results in the power stations huge boilers the material needs to be turned into a very fine powder in pulverising mills when very fine the fuel burns as efficiently and as quickly as a gas inside each mill are 10 giant steel balls that grind down either the wood pellets or coal each ball is three quarters of a metre in size made of hollow cast steel alloy and weighs roughly 12 tonnes  equivalent in weight to britishmade jaguar xe midsized saloon car or an entire football team and to make sure that each one is up to the task of extreme pulverisation they need to be hard each one is heat treated during manufacture to make sure theyre up robust enough to consistently crush raw fuel the benefit of this durability is that they can readily pulverise fuel to feed drax boilers to power kettles across the country  a big responsibility for a big ball tags engineering  power station  technology  visit us  wood pellets how does europe use biomass sustainable bioenergy at the heart of norse folklore is a figure called yggdrasil that connects its nine worlds and gods its an immensely important and holy icon but it is not a god itself  it is an ash tree that the central figure of mythical scandinavian cosmology should be something as humble as a tree is no surprise scandinavia is a heavily forested region sweden the largest country in the area is more than 68 forest wood is an inherent part of life there for thousands of years its been used as a resource and a fuel and today is no different throughout much of europe the same is true but while historically wood was used only for cooking heating and light today its use as a form of energy also includes generating electricity and heat when formed into compressed wood pellets europe and wood pellets nearly 22 million tonnes mt of wood pellets were used in the european union in 2015 making the region the leading wood pellet consumer in the world it is also the worlds leading producer creating roughly half of the worlds global output  largely from european trees a report from the standing forestry committee set up to represent the forestry industries in eu countries found that just 4 of the woody biomass used in the eu was imported of the 22mt used across europe 105mt was used for heating while 115mt was used for industrial uses like fueling power plants but in the uk the level of wood used for fuel falls some way behind eu averages thanks in large part to drax and its transition from coal to renewable wood pelletpowered electricity generation thats changing but the uk still has a way to go to catch the continental average where is the uk falling behind and how is wood being used to power the rest of the continent here we look at some of the largest consumers and producers of biomass in europe and how its being used sweden sweden is the third highest consumer of wood as a source of energy in europe trailing only finland and latvia in its use a key use of biomass in sweden is powering district heating systems in a district heating system rather than each building or home having its own boiler whole areas of cities are heated through a single central plant distributing heat to buildings these plants can be powered by a variety of fuels but many run on wood pellets or distribute the waste heat captured at power plants germany in 1713 an accountant and mining administrator hans carl von carlowitz published what is considered the first ever book to look in depth at forestry management effectively kickstarting the modern idea of sustainable forestry in the 300 years that have passed germany has embraced the cultivation of wood and has made wood and biomass a fixed part of its energy makeup more recently the renewable energy heating act and market incentive programme was passed in 2009 which requires new building owners to provide a percentage of their heat from renewable sources including woodfired boilers the aim is to increase the countrys share of renewable heat to 14 by 2020 finland nearly three quarters of finland is forestland making it one of the most forested countries in the world let alone europe as a result wood plays a large part in finnish culture stora enso one of the worlds leading paper and packaging manufacturers is finnish and more than 20 of the countrys exports are from wood and wood products coupled with a strong focus generating much of its energy from renewables energy derived from wood and products made from wood is high united kingdom in 2013 less than 10 of all energy used in the uk was generated from wood and wood products this places it some way behind countries like germany and sweden in part owing to a lack of infrastructure for providing heating derived from wood and wood biomass this could change if the government continues to back technologies equally in initiatives like the renewable heat incentive rhi available to homeowners landlords and commercial customers rhi provides incentives for installing generators of renewable heat such as wood pellet boilers  to reach climate goals the then department of energy and climate change noted that both biomassdriven electricity generation and heating should continue to increase in the uk and with the upgrade of drax and lynemouth power stations from coal to compressed wood pellets there are positive signs the uk can catch up to the european biomass average in doing so renewable biomass electricity generation can also help increase wind and solar power generation in the uk and help create a more sustainable energy future tags biomass energy  energy policy  wood pellets  1 2 3
