an auction on 30 march 2017 drax has now completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of louisiana pellets 1  the acquisition price was 354m louisiana pellets will provide additional biomass pellet capacity in the region of 450k tonnes pa playing an important part in draxs strategy to build a flexible supply chain capable of selfsupplying 30 of its generation requirement the plant is expected to return to service by early 2018 following incremental investment to upgrade and optimise the facility dorothy thompson chief executive officer of drax group said louisiana pellets marks another positive step in delivering the drax group strategy the deal forms part of our plan to significantly increase our capability to manufacture high quality compressed wood pellets and increase selfsupply to drax power station upgrading half the power station to use sustainable wood pellets has resulted in drax producing 16 of the uks renewable electricity and with the right conditions we

bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made tags biomass energy  forests  investors  sustainability  technology 4 amazing uses of bioenergy 5 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy bioenergy is the worlds largest renewable energy source providing 10 of the worlds primary supply  but more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station and smaller power plants but this isnt the only way bioenergy is being used around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways powering selfsufficient robots what type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags biomass energy  investors  sustainability  technology the biomass carbon story matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 23 february 2017 sustainable bioenergy there is an important difference between carbon dioxide co 2  emitted from coal and other fossil fuels and co 2 emitted from renewable sources both do emit co 2 when burnt but in climate change terms the impact of that co 2 is very different to understand this difference it helps to think small and scale up it helps to think of your own back garden one tree every year for 30 years imagine you are lucky enough to have a garden with space for 30 trees three decades ago you decided to plant one tree per year every year in this example each tree grows to maturity over thirty years so today you find yourself with a thriving copse with 30 trees at different stages of growth ranging from one year to 30 years old at 30 years of age the oldest has now reached maturity and you cut it down  in the spring of course before the sap rises  and leave the logs to dry over the summer you plant a new seedling in its place through the summer and autumn the 29 established trees and the new seedling you planted continue to grow absorbing carbon from the atmosphere to do so winter comes and when it turns cold and dark you burn the seasoned wood to keep warm burning it will indeed emit carbon to the atmosphere however by end of the winter the other 29 trees plus the sapling you planted will be at exactly the same stage of growth as the previous spring contain the same amount of wood and hence the same amount of carbon as long as you fell and replant one tree every year on a 30year cycle the atmosphere will see no extra co 2 and youll have used the energy captured by their growth to warm your home harvesting only what is grown is the essence of sustainable forest management if you didnt have your seasoned selfsupplied wood to burn you might have been forced to burn coal or use more gas to heat your home over the course of the same winter these fuels would have emitted carbon to the atmosphere which endlessly accumulates  causing climate change not only does your tree husbandry provide you with an endlessly renewable supply of fuel but you also might enjoy other benefits such as the shelter your trees provide and the diversity of wildlife they attract no added carbon this is a simplified example but the principles hold true whether your forest contains 30 trees or 300 million  the important point is that with these renewable carbon emissions provided you take out less wood than is growing and you at least replace the trees you take out you do not add new carbon to the atmosphere that is not true with fossil fuels it is true that you could have chosen not to have trees you could instead build a wind turbine or install solar panels on your land that would be a perfectly reasonable choice but youll still need to use the coal at night when the sun doesnt shine or when the wind isnt blowing worst of all you dont get all the other benefits of a thriving forest  its seasonal beauty and the habitat thats maintained for wildlife of course the wood drax needs doesnt grow in our garden we bring it many miles from areas where there are large sustainably managed forests and we carefully account for the carbon emissions in the harvesting processing and transporting the fuel to drax  thats why we only achieve more than 80 carbon savings compared to coal tags decarbonisation
