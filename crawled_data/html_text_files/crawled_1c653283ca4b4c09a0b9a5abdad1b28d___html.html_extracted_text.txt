Introduction
It has been a mixed quarter for wind power.
Wind capacity overtakes gas
After more than a century of fossil fuel infrastructure dominating our electricity system, Britain has now installed more wind capacity than any other type of power station.
Offshore wind held up by the inflation storm
Vattenfall have suspended development of their 1.4 GW Norfolk Boreas Wind farm, in a major blow for the offshore wind industry.
Fossil-fuel output falls by a quarter
Electricity generation from fossil fuels fell to its lowest levels since the COVID-19 lockdown.
UK carbon prices sink
The UK’s carbon price has plunged by 40% in recent months, and it now trades at its biggest ever discount to Europe.
Capacity and production statistics
After last quarter’s role reversal, gas overtook wind again to be the largest source of electricity produced.
Power system records
It was a relatively quiet three months, with only solar PV and imports breaking records over the last quarter.
