is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built in a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain constructed in 1965 its reversible turbines are still at the cutting edge of energy storage technology enabling the plant to act like a giant water battery as part of the visit drax groups director of scottish assets ian kinnaird outlined the companys exciting work on plans to build a new second underground pumped hydro storage power station at the cruachan complex drax is progressing plans to build a new 600 mw underground plant adjacent to its existing underground cruachan facility in argyll scotland increasing the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is critical to enabling more wind and solar power to come online strengthening the countrys energy security while helping scotland and the whole of the uk to decarbonise ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said cruachan plays a critical role in stabilising the electricity system balancing supply and demand by storing excess power from the national grid when scotlands wind turbines are generating more power than we need cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesnt go to waste drax has exciting plans to more than double cruachans generating capacity a project that will support new green jobs and help our homes and businesses go greener by bringing more renewable power online ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director and joe fitzpatrick the scottish governments planning minister the scottish governments planning minister joe fitzpatrick said scotland has a proud history of hydro power and currently accounts for around 88 of total uk capacity our recently adopted national planning framework 4 is clear about the importance of pumped hydro storage and continues its designation as a national development scotlands facilities have the potential to play a significantly greater role in the energy transition while contributing to the resilience of electricity supply and creating jobs in rural locations we continue to press the uk government to ensure that the appropriate market and regulatory arrangements are put in place to support the further development of hydro projects pumped storage hydro plants act like giant water batteries using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when it is needed drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation when all four of its

lowcarbon power includes renewable sources  biomass hydro wind and solar  as well as nuclear and these sources also combined to break the record for the volume of clean surplus power produced  29gw during 2022 there were nearly 100 hours where the grid delivered more clean power than it needed despite this surplus some fossil fuel generators were required to stay running in order to provide the flexibility and inertia that national grid eso relies on to stabilise the power system although the minimum safe amount of fossil fuels is continuously falling inching national grid eso closer to its 2025 goal of being able to eradicate this during surplus periods clean power the electricity generation mix over the last week of 2022 periods when total supply from lowcarbon sources exceeded demand are highlighted in pale green dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report said britains power grid has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last decade with surplus clean electricity having switched from being a pipe dream to becoming a reality electricity is the only form of energy where we produce more than we consume  in comparison to our coal and gas requirements where 6075 are still imported from abroad completely eliminating fossil fuels during periods of high renewable output and low demand in the next two years requires significant policy and infrastructure decisions to be made now having a new department for energy security and net zero is a positive step to focus government attention on this and other key targets such as delivering the large amount of carbon removals from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs that will make a critical contribution to its legally binding decarbonisation targets the uk has led the world in greening its grid further and faster than any other major economy and we need to ensure we dont lose the momentum to make net zero a reality drax

station  to use sustainably sourced biomass to generate renewable electricity instead of coal the company plans to deploy beccs technology at its uk plant by 2027 alongside removing four million tonnes of co2 from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 will gardiner drax group ceo said being able to generate a surplus of clean lowcarbon electricity is a landmark achievement for the uk at drax we believe the uk can go even further in the years ahead by removing millions of tonnes of co2 from the atmosphere each year while generating reliable secure renewable electricity through beccs while countries across the world and particularly the us are stepping up to address climate change we believe the uk government must accelerate its policy support for beccs to give this country the best chance of establishing itself as a world leader in carbon removals attracting further clean energy investment and delivering its net zero targets drax has helped keep the uks power grid secure for the past 50 years and through beccs we will continue to do so for another 50 years view the full report here  ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors
