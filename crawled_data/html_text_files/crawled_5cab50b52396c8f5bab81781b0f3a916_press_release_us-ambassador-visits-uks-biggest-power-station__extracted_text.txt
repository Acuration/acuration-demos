power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station us ambassador visits uks biggest power station us ambassador robert wood johnson visited drax power station near selby in north yorkshire yesterday thursday october 25th to learn more about the uks largest power station and its contribution to the uk economy 26 october 2018 mr johnson the ambassador of the united states of america to the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland had a tour of the power station and heard about how drax upgraded two thirds of its generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe around 60 per cent of the biomass used by drax to produce enough renewable electricity for four million households comes from the sustainable working forests of the us south  making it the biggest importer of us agricultural products drax also operates three pellet plants in the us south which produce biomass for the power station in north yorkshire mr johnson met with drax group ceo will gardiner and drax power ceo andy koss to hear about the transformation of the power station and their plans for the future he heard about their plans for a bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot project  due to get underway this autumn which if successful could enable the power produced at drax to become carbon negative  making a vital contribution to efforts to tackle climate change they also outlined proposals to repower the two remaining coal units to use gas and develop up to 200mw of battery storage as well as the proposed 702 million acquisition of some of scottish powers flexible and renewable power generation assets including pumped storage and hydro  which drax announced recently mr johnson said being here at drax has been fascinating  the scale of the place is incredible and the innovative projects and new technology being trialled here are very exciting drax makes a really important contribution to the us economy  i am pleased to be here to mark the important investment they make will gardiner drax group ceo said we are delighted to welcome the ambassador to drax power station to celebrate the successful transatlantic relationship between drax and the us which plays a vital role in enabling us to source the biomass needed to produce enough flexible renewable power for millions of homes and businesses in the uk we play a valuable role in the communities where we operate in the us creating jobs and breathing new life into areas previously affected by industrial decline since the acquisition of a third pellet mill we now employ almost 250 people over there with plans to grow our selfsupply of biomass so were producing up to 30 of the pellets used at the power station lr drax power ceo andy koss ambassador johnson drax group ceo will gardiner and stan phillips agricultural counselor andy koss drax power ceo added one of the biggest challenges we had when we converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal was in creating a completely new global supply chain for biomass we invested around 700m in new infrastructure both here at the power station but also in the pellet mills we own and the port facilities we use in the us  all of that has been vital to the success of the transformation of the business were now the uks biggest renewable power producer generating around 15 of the countrys renewable electricity drax contributed around 17bn in gdp to the uk economy and supported more than 18500 jobs here in 2016 that included more than 500m to the northern powerhouses regional economy and support for 6000 jobs here ends media contact jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07837 946802 notes to editors main photo lr drax group ceo will gardiner  ambassador johnson drax power ceo andy koss and stan phillips agricultural counselor draxs acquisition of scottish powers generation assets is expected to complete at the end of the year subject to shareholder approval drax recently converted the fourth of its six generating units from coal to use sustainable biomass  around 70 of the power produced at the power station is now renewable it has plans to repower its two remaining coal generating units to use gas which are being considered by the planning inspectorate if approved drax could stop using coal well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks
