exec summary  intro will gardiner ceo drax group click to viewdownload in high res foreword our world is changing fast new technologies are transforming the way we live and work they are changing businesses and communities and creating huge opportunities to improve our quality of life and britains ability to compete in a global economy this shift is being enabled by a revolution taking place across our energy system  ultimately to a zero carbon low cost system where technology and data will enable businesses and homeowners to create energy as well as use it and give them more control over the energy they use these changes are creating significant benefits but as in every transition there is a risk that those most able to take advantage of new technologies will enjoy their benefits first while others get left behind a failure to ensure the transition is enjoyed across britain will also undermine much needed progress to decarbonise our economy and tackle climate change drax is at the heart of the energy transition we see these changes taking place every day  across our businesses and among the customers and communities we serve whats less clear is how britain is faring through this change now for the first time this report gives us some answers researchers at imperial college london and e4tech have looked right across our economy using 20 different metrics they have assessed progress in critical sectors including power transport and industry crucially theyve also broken down their findings to a regional level the results make stark reading while real progress has been made in some sectors to decarbonise others lag behind while most nations and regions have taken steps to create the future energy system we need the picture is not uniform most worrying is clear evidence that once again a divide is opening between those parts of the country where people are better placed to take advantage of new technologies  and those who are not the conclusion is clear failure to address these energy divides will leave some communities falling behind it will restrict our businesses ability to compete in a fierce global economy and our efforts to tackle climate change will be hindered to respond energy companies businesses communities and governments must work together drax is committed to play our part im proud of the contribution we have already made we have transformed the uks largest coalfired power station to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the countrys biggest renewable power generator today we maintain significant generation capacity and aim to bolster our ability to provide flexible lowcarbon generation further  supporting the increase in solar and wind power across britains energy system were trialling innovative bioenergy carbon capture use and storage technology which is the first of its kind in europe and has the potential to deliver negative emissions and through our retail businesses we are helping thousands of business switch to use 100 renewable energy and use it more efficiently but this report shows us there is much more to do we will continue to invest in and develop the new technologies which will finish the job of taking drax off coal ensure we become zero carbon and play a bigger part in decarbonising the wider economy and we will continue to help our customers reduce their own carbon emissions save money and create new revenues from energy production which will boost their ability to compete in their own markets our role is clear drax is enabling a zero carbon lower cost future for all this report reinforces the challenges ahead but also the opportunities to meet them i commit drax to playing our part to do so authors dr iain staffell dr malte jansen

commissioned by drax group and delivered independently by academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company imperial consultants and consultants from e4tech drax group commissioned the authors to conduct new research into how transformations in britains energy system are likely to impact the countrys economic societal and environmental outcomes the aim of this research is to provide insight into the changes that are occurring and those that are needed to ensure that energy system transformation unlocks opportunities for businesses government and households in a just and equitable way this report is the independent opinion of the authors it focuses on great britain rather than the united kingdom as lack of data prevented northern ireland from being included drax group drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of

international strategic consultancy focused on sustainable energy e4tech helps clarify and simplify complex and uncertain situations to achieve solutions that are technologically economically and environmentally sound executive summary why this report matters major pressures are shifting the uks patterns of employment leisure travel and industry with consequences for our energy needs at the same time the uk has made strong commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to energy many towns and cities struggle with chronic air pollution from cars vans and lorries businesses and households face rising energy bills putting a squeeze on both economic competitiveness and quality of life electrification is essential touching all elements of britains changing economy and energy system renewable electricity has radically transformed the power sector and electric vehicles are poised to revolutionise transport electricity could lower the cost and pollution from home heating and the daily commute as well as the way in which large buildings and factories operate alongside electricity other ingredients of the future energy system will include a growing role for data minimising energy use when power is in short supply and maximising use when and where it is plentiful flexibly managing demand and supply making intelligent use of low carbon fuels and heat and potentially capturing greenhouse gases together these changes are known as the energy revolution there is strong global evidence of the imperative for this significant and  increasingly  urgent change work towards the energy revolution is underway in uk but so far much of the action has been behind the scenes the sweeping changes to how we generate electricity have not changed what happens when you turn on the lights at home but the next steps will impact on everyday life for many the emergence of electric vehicles intelligent home energy management and zerocarbon buildings are all necessary to stay competitive and honour our climate change and related policy targets these will have profound implications on the cost of energy and how people receive energy services so it is imperative to outline these changes for stakeholders of all types the uks energy transition is well described by national and international expert bodies but mainly looking at individual components of the system in terms of technologies costs and benefits these studies treat countries and continents as a whole potentially missing the important socioeconomic and environmental differences that exist within countries this assessment is the first to examine britains energy transition at the regional level showing where each aspect of the energy system currently stands and where it must go to avoid being left behind this assessment is the first to examine britains energy transition at the regional level showing where each aspect of the energy system currently stands and where it must go to avoid being left behind it looks more broadly than raw emissions reductions to consider the many infrastructural enablers for revolutionising the energy system crucially it explores what these changes will mean for individual households businesses and society as a whole and exposes the important regional differences that are developing within britain without awareness of these regional disparities and their potential impacts britain risks creating a twotier energy system where some get ahead with the fuels and technologies of the future while others are left behind with the higher costs environmental and health problems that come from burning legacy fossil fuels  leaving millions of families and businesses less equipped to enjoy cheaper bills and better outcomes britain risks creating a twotier energy system where some get ahead with the fuels and technologies of the future while others are left behind with the higher costs environmental and health problems that come from burning legacy fossil fuels  leaving millions of families and businesses less equipped to enjoy cheaper bills and better outcomes britains energy transition progress this report analyses britains complex and highly interdependent energy system by considering power generation and then energy use in transport buildings and industry within these four sectors 20 measures have been devised to represent britains progress towards having an energy system thats fit for the future and can serve households and businesses with clean secure and lowcost energy aggregate progress is summarised with a barometer below for three of the four sectors britains greenhouse gas ghg emissions have fallen since 1990 but the decline is not evenly distributed across energy sectors the outstanding success has been in the power sector chiefly through closing coalfired generation and the rise of renewables also benefiting air quality further progress is expected raising the importance of a smart and flexible power system that features demand side response storage interconnections and smart meters most of these areas are behind target requiring immediate efforts to bring them in step with growing renewables the rapid cleanup of the power sector has fed through into electricityconsuming areas such as industry where economic growth has decoupled from ghg emissions britains industry is currently on track to reach climate targets absolute electricity use in industry has stayed constant while fossil fuel combustion has declined as processes have been electrified and efficiency increases have been made further electrification will be harder so ghg reductions may need to come through technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture use and storage ccus all of this is made harder still by the need for most industries to remain internationally competitive whilst avoiding the offshoring of emissions and jobs to other countries in contrast with the power sector the limited pace of transformation in transport and domestic heating means that there is much more to do of particular concern is air quality in britains cities and the slow progress being made on diesel pollution but co2 emissions from transport are also on the rise especially from goods vehicles the stage is set for a radical shift in transportation thanks to recharging infrastructure growth and ev sales picking up over a quarter of new vehicle sales are expected to be plugins by 2030 and forecasts are frequently being revised upwards electric buses are finding a place in cities where pollution is a pressing problem but electric goods vehicles are some way behind hydrogen vehicles and infrastructure remain in their infancy in uk though these provide a zero emission option for goods vehicles where batteries appear less suitable furthermore hydrogen may offer a means to electrify railway lines where the cost of overhead power lines is prohibitive the efficiency of britains building stock is a critical issue with 13 of homes suffering from fuel poverty and nondomestic buildings generally worse than households uk buildings remain largely heated by fossil fuels so only a few parts of the uk are wellplaced to benefit from the decarbonisation of power through electric heating the outlook for heating is unclear with heat pumps electric heating and hydrogen each having their proponents but no overall direction regardless of the pathway choice which is needed urgently building efficiency will be a core feature thankfully appliances and lighting in buildings have seen improved efficiency and thus reducing pressure on energy bills and indirect ghg emissions from the power sector regional disparities progress in transforming britains energy system is uneven and this report reveals marked differences between the regions generally more affluent regions have made significantly greater progress the north of england is falling well short with only london and scotland coming close to being on track to meet their overall targets this first step towards exposing the differences between the regions paints an instructive picture of britains unequal progress and it should be remembered that differences within individual regions will be similarly important renewable power generation is distributed according to natural resources so england has much less lowcarbon power per person than scotland and wales however scotland and wales also have some of the lowest transmission capacities to neighbouring regions holding back further development of renewables in contrast with the general picture for most metrics wales and the north east have the highest penetration of smart meters in britain london the lowest in a fastchanging transport picture the west midlands and the east currently have the highest uptake of passenger electric vehicles london has the most electric buses while the south east northern regions of england and scotland have the highest share of ultralow emission hgvs on an absolute basis however the south of england is leading in the deployment of plugin electric vehicles which is correlated to higher household incomes in these regions energy efficiency in buildings is neglected across britain and much lower than is justifiable however it is generally better in the south of england and scotland and worse in the midlands northern england and wales the north east has done the most to fix lowefficiency houses but still has high fuel poverty rates due to income levels and remaining poor quality buildings implications for individuals businesses and society cost reductions in key technologies such as renewable generators and batteries show that the costs of transforming the energy system could be modest ultimately moving to modern clean energy could result in the lowest bills although any increased capital costs to consumers and businesses should be considered in the context of affordability homes and companies in london and the south east spend less on energy relative to income those in wales and the north east spend the most so any changes to energy costs will make the greatest difference to the welfare and profits of homes and businesses in these areas in transport the total cost of owning electric vehicles is on track to reach parity with conventional vehicles however the higher upfront purchase price of evs poses a greater affordability barrier in less affluent regions scotland and wales have lowest ev affordability the west midlands and london the highest if marked differences in uptake arise from this britains cities could see rising inequality due to the health effects of air pollution in industry further electrification may be difficult without impacting on energy costs unless measures are taken to level the playing field the changing power mix is shifting employment patterns with job losses in fossil fuels offset by gains in new industries often in poorer remote areas electrification and automation often go hand in hand and the south east midlands and north of england face the highest risk of job losses from automation overall conclusions in this first assessment of britains energy transition there is much to be positive about but the observation that the future is already here  its just not very evenly distributed applies the rapid decarbonisation of electricity is a feather in the uks cap providing a means to transform electricityintensive sectors buildings and to some extent industry are already benefiting whilst transport is potentially wellpositioned there are tough challenges ahead though since areas such as heavy industry freight transport and some parts of heating do not immediately lend themselves to electrification so other options need to be considered the uneven distribution of change also applies regionally and socially a looming concern is the effect of disparities in the energy transition with some at risk of being left behind economically due to unaffordable changes as in other walks of life london stands apart whilst less affluent regions in the north and elsewhere are falling behind on many measures as in other walks of life london stands apart whilst less affluent regions in the north and elsewhere are falling behind on many measures if the sole aim of the transition were to decarbonise energy it might be rational to focus on wealthier metropolitan areas like london ahead of the rest of the country however if this begins to affect our way of life through the cost of energy quality of services and air pollution then such a strategy risks creating a twotrack energy system that worsens regional inequality to be effective the uks energy transformation needs be a force for good across society and across the uk not just where it is most convenient to be effective the uks energy transformation needs be a force for good across society and across the uk not just where it is most convenient introduction 11 context and motivation the energy transition is being driven top down by climate and environmental policy and bottomup by evolving consumer preferences and technological innovation britain has made excellent progress in transforming its power sector at a worldleading pace which has allowed decarbonisation that is largely invisible to consumers  no change in lifestyle added daily considerations and little impact on bills there is a growing recognition that change must now sweep through other sectors we must transform the way energy is provided in homes businesses transport and industry there is a huge opportunity for newlycleaned electricity to transform these sectors the key gaps are understanding how the country is progressing more broadly towards a transformed energy system carbon emissions are well understood but are the wider changes to electrification and its enabling infrastructure also making headway understanding the differences within britain  national studies mask regional differences  are we at risk of creating winners and losers in the energy transition this change could have profound social and economic implications for the country if some sectors or regions forge ahead and others are left behind this could create a twospeed economy and lead to substantial differences in the cost of energy some may be forced to use legacy infrastructure and support it together with a dwindling consumer base whereas others may take advantage of affordable lowcarbon solutions independent from these costs 12 scope and methods 121 about this study this study sets out to explore the current status of the power system and how it needs to change to deal with electrification demands and the need for lowcarbon power the current status targets and regional disparities in the energy transition in enduse sectors are mapped finally the implications that can be drawn from these results for technologies and socioeconomic factors are evaluated focussing on affordability competitiveness and jobs this work was commissioned by drax to assess the state of energy system transformation across all sectors it is delivered independently by academics at imperial college london and sustainable energy consultants e4tech this report is the start of an ongoing discussion titled energising britain where future outlook reports will address aspects of the energy transition 122 technological and geographical scope the energising britain work examines britains energy system in the context of the 2008 climate change act and the cop21 paris climate agreement to achieve this not only power but also the transport buildings and industrial energy sectors need to be decarbonised given the ongoing decarbonisation of the electricity system and the continuously falling costs of renewables this work investigates how all energy sectors can be decarbonised through electrification this entails the use of lowcarbon generation technologies hydrogen and carbon capture use and storage ccus where suitable to understand the regional differences in how britains energy system is being transformed this report considers the 11 unitary regions of great britain scotland wales and 9 in england northern ireland could not be included due to the availability of data and because of the different electricity markets operating on the islands of ireland and great britain northern ireland accounts for approximately 3 of the population and energy consumption of the uk 123 underlying methodology the main principle for our assessment is to derive metrics that identify the state of transition of the energy system these metrics are presented as a barometer which sets out three points the endpoint of the transformation for the target year in the scenario eg total number of ev charging points in 2030 the current state of transformation eg number of charging points operational and an indication of where we would have to be to meet the target eg number of charging points justifiable targets for each metric are derived which show the state of transformation and where we should be if we are to fulfil our legal obligations the endpoint targets allow us to locate our position in the energy transition in line with carbon budgets and climate targets national and regional level data have been gathered for each metric in order to explore regional disparities and their implications for people this translates energy systems findings into social and economic implications the analysis is based on public data primarily government sources providing transparency accuracy and independence especially in the case of target definitions for individual metrics the study relies on energy system scenarios published by national grid hm government including beis and the committee on climate change ccc 13 background 131 the regions of britain figure 11 presents some underlying indicators for the 11 unitary regions of britain and northern ireland for context figure 11 key socioeconomic indicators for the uks 12 unitary regions there are already many differences in the regions starting points london stands out as a purely urban region with high incomes and population density the midlands and wales are the most industrialised wealth is divided between north and south as this study investigates the socioeconomic impact of the energy system transition it must be noted that the unitary regions have different starting points some regions may have an advantage for example in terms of income or commercial and industrial economic activity and are therefore better positioned to make certain changes the overarching question is whether the energy transition changes this picture for better or for worse 132 what is electrification the general discussion on electrification of the energy sector is often focussed on the electrification of road and rail transport this ignores the fact that many other areas of the economy and society in britain are being electrified therefore this study provides a more holistic approach at the decarbonisation of all energy sector power building transport and industry and answers the question on what the electrification of britains economy will look like and the technologies involved on the supply side ie the power system lowcarbon technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas ghg emissions are in focus as well as technologies that allow for the integration of these low carbon sources eg energy storage the study identifies a list of technologies which are considered relevant when electrifying the energy system as these technologies mature the picture will change and this list will have to be adjusted the technologies that are currently relevant in the power sector are wind and solar nuclear batteries and storage gasfired generators with carbon capture use and storage ccus grid expansion and construction of interconnectors smart meters and demand side response dsr on the building side besides increasing energy efficiency we are looking at electrifying heating with heat pumps and electric heaters the transport sector of the energy system includes the state and target for key transport technologies such as electric vehicles cars buses and hgvs charging points hydrogen refuelling station and electrification of rail lastly the current status of industry and implications from trends in the industrial sector are discussed it is noteworthy that this sector has the least data coverage as the energy system transition continues measuring the progress in industry will be required to track the overall progress towards climate targets and avoid unintended socioeconomic implications of a transitioning energy system the heterogeneity of industrial processes requires an approach which presents key metrics such as energy intensity as a function of gross value added gva ghg emissions or energy use the socialeconomic implications of the energy system transition to further electrification andor automation are presented 133 the sectors in context this study investigates the power transport buildings and industrial sectors and the extent of their transformation all sectors need to decarbonise to ensure the overall national target is met meaning that many sectors will need to undergo further transformations sectors such as agriculture remain outside the scope of this study but do however contribute to net ghg emissions electricity supply is being treated as its own sector meaning the related ghg emissions from electricity production are attributed to the sector ghg emissions only include direct emissions for the enduse sectors unless otherwise specified therefore excluding the indirect emissions associated with electricity use the power sector has seen large reductions in ghg emissions section 21 causing the energy supply sector to heavily decrease its share of total ghg emissions over the last 5 years figure 12 in 2017 over two thirds of electricity supply was consumed by buildings just under a third in industry and the remaining small percentage in transport figure 13 figure 12 greenhouse gas emissions by sector 19902017  direct emissions accounted from source the transport sectors relative share of total ghg emissions has been increasing since 1990 section 31 and for the first time in 2016 the share of transport emissions surpassed the share of emissions originating from the energy supply sector in absolute terms however total gb transport emissions have decreased compared to 1990 and 2008 this is likely linked to the global recession increased fuel efficiency and increased use of renewable energy in transport only 2 of the energy used in transport comes from electricity and this has remained fairly constant since at least 2008 figure 14 the sector is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels though there have been recent increases in the use of biofuels and electricity especially in road transport figure 13 the share of electricity in total energy consumption by enduse sectors in 2017 emissions from buildings are a combination of the household and business  public sectors in figure 12 in 2017 ghg emissions from buildings accounted for 19 of total ghg emissions section 41 the share of direct emissions from all subsectors of buildings have remained relatively constant since 1990 with the residential subsector showing a small increase in absolute terms all of these subsectors thus the buildings sector as a whole have significantly reduced their direct emissions during this period electricity use in buildings has remained relatively constant since 2008 suggesting that direct emission decreases are linked to other factors rather than increased electrification rates eg energy efficiency emissions from the industrial sector are composed of emissions related to industrial processes as well as some business and power sector emissions in 2017 the industrial sector made up 23 of total ghg emissions the emissions from industry are discussed in more detail in section 52 further electricity use in industry has consistently remained around a third of total energy usage figure 14 figure 14 the use of electricity in the sector as a percentage of total energy consumption as mentioned above electricity usage in the sectors investigated for this report has remained fairly constant since 2008 increasing electricity use can reduce the direct emissions of an enduse sector especially if the electricity is replacing a fossil fuel however depending on the carbon intensity of the power sector total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions could increase chapter 2 the power system the uks carbon budgets require major decarbonisation of energy supply by 2050 virtually all electricity must come from clean sources large scale use of intermittent renewables will require extensive flexibility options for balancing many options exist interconnection storage demand side response and flexible generation so consumers should not see any difference in terms of supply quality the current pathway relies heavily on wind and solar power driven by the large cost reductions they have experienced if these intermittent renewables continue to dominate future electricity supply the location of power generation will change and the economic activity that comes with it  favouring rural and coastal areas the rollout of smart meters is taking place at very different speeds across britain wales is leading whereas london is lagging the structure of the housing sector is a strong influence lower home ownership places some regions at a disadvantage demand response from commercial and industrial sites is already active but the large domestic resource eg smart appliances such as fridges and washing machines cannot be tapped without rollout of smart meters energy bills may be higher than today regardless of power sector transformation due to rising fossil fuel system service costs however large cost reductions in key technologies such as renewables batteries and hydrogen suggest that regions which can take advantage of these through electric vehicles and heat pumps could see the cheapest energy renewables have led to job creation especially in poorer regions scottish renewables have created a strong new industrial sector job losses in the legacy fossilfuel sectors are offset by growth in renewable industries the dispersed nature of renewables means that the jobs created in construction operation and maintenance are in more remote areas giving a welcome employment boost figure 21 progress towards transforming britains power system highlighting the areas that are under and overperforming relative to nearterm targets for decarbonisation each area is reviewed later in this section 21 current status and future targets for the power sector the following section will give a detailed analysis on the current status of the power sector and how it is progressing against its targets overall the sector is on track to achieve three out of the six targets examined for this research with three being well on track figure 21 further it is falling behind on three other targets the effects of progress towards each target are not directly comparable in that achieving some targets will have greater effects on the energy transformation than others therefore this barometer figure 21 gives an indicative understanding on how the sector is progressing the island location of gb creates a unique challenge for the power system when compared to its continental european counterparts this shows in the increased balancing needs to maintain system stability the need for flexibility is disproportionally larger when compared to highly interconnected systems the gb power system has proven that electricity generation can change rapidly in a short time span the gb power system has demonstrated that carbon reduction by overhauling the generation mix is possible in a very short time the introduction of a carbon floor price and clean air legislation has reduced the use of coal power plants by fivesixths in the last 5 years at the same time significant amounts of wind solar and bioenergy have entered the power system and gas generation has seen a renaissance nuclear power has maintained its share of the mix in the past decade however based on current projections it is likely that replacements will not outweigh closures in the coming decade figure 22 shows the generation share and total generation of all major generation types for the last 9 years the analysis is conducted at gblevel as northern ireland is part of the power system of ireland figure 22 development of the generation mix and total power generation between 2009 and 2017 these changes have led to a redistribution of generators around britain the closure of coal power plants nearer to the load centres in england and scotland on the one side has been offset by the construction of renewables in scotland the south west of england and wales the total installed capacity of renewables is highest is scotland and wales with a relatively homogenous distribution of renewable capacity through england the west midlands the north east and london stand out as having little generation capacity due to population density and resource availability a similar picture is visible when looking at the installed capacity of renewables per capita where scotland and wales are leading and equal in value both have about twice the capacity installed as the rest of britain which raises a challenge for the grid to cope with the redirected flow of electricity and may require investments figure 23 shows distribution of power stations by generator type the last remaining coal stations are located in yorkshire the midlands the north west and wales these stations are due to be closed no later than 2025 apart from drax power station in yorkshire where four of its six units have been converted to use biomass instead of coal the energy system transition will alter the location of power stations and a redistribution of economic activity and employment in the country this raises the question how to best facilitate the energy system transition not only in terms of energy system issues but also economic development and employment retaining large parts of the workforce through conversion or the investment in renewables may help to ease the transition additional discussion on the topic can be found in 22 transforming the energy system affects the locations of generators and so redistributes economic and employment across the regions previous closures of coal stations in the west midlands have left the region almost entirely reliant on electricity imports from other regions due to the lack of local renewable generation capacity conversely scotland invested heavily in onshore wind before its thermal fleet were retired this makes scotland a substantial exporter of electricity wales hosts large hydro power stations legacy renewables masking the relatively slow progress of its energy transition the installed base of renewable energy sources res shows a concentration of biomass generation in yorkshire and the north east solar power is predominant in the south west south east and east anglia onshore wind is mostly deployed in scotland whereas offshore wind on the other hand is more evenly allocated around the coast of britain and closer to the load centres mainly connected to england generally speaking wind and solar follow the resource availability within a tight framework of planning permission due to the topography hydropower and pumpedhydro storage can only be found in wales and scotland and not in the rest of the country britains conventional power stations britains renewable power stations figure 23 location of power generation in great britain energy to waste plants are grouped with biomass nonrenewable thermal generation coal gas and nuclear is more concentrated than renewable generation gas stations are more widely distributed throughout the country and located closer to the load centres coal is now restricted to central england and wales nuclear power stations are all located on the coasts due to the volume of cooling water intake and security considerations interestingly the west midlands and greater london no longer have any large scale thermal generation the transition from coal to gas fired power stations sees a shift away from typically slowramping base load power plants to more flexible combined cycle gas turbines fewer operating hours for the residual generators and variable output over time figure 24 regional distribution of power stations in great britain showing renewable three maps on the left and conventional three right hydro plants are not shown these are all concentrated in wales and scotland 211 carbon intensity the reduction of coal has led to a strongly decreasing carbon intensity of the produced electricity between 2009 and 2018 this is due to the lower carbon content of natural gas when compared to hard coal the carbon intensity of grid electricity has more than halved within five years after the introduction of the carbon floor price and emissions directives further decarbonisation however will prove more challenging the carbon intensity of grid electricity peaked in 2012 at 508 gkwh and has since more than halved to 237 gkwh this change came at a remarkable speed after the introduction of a carbonfloor price of 18 tco 2 transformed the economics of coal power stations and enabled their rapid phaseout further increases in the co 2 price are likely to be necessary to build momentum on further decarbonisation of power generation 5 despite this the shift towards low carbon technologies is likely to be more challenging and not as rapid as the phaseout of coal further decarbonisation will require building new generators rather than simply redeploying existing ones 6 a recent uptake of the european carbon price euets to over 20 18 per tco 2 should provide a stable environment outside the countryspecific carbon floor price policy instruments figure 25 barometer for grid electricity carbon intensity additional policy support is required to keep the rate of decarbonisation at the same pace for example the application of carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus technology to capture co 2 emissions from gasfired and biomass power plants b is still in its infancy the need for decarbonisation using ccus has seen a renewed support commitment in the clean growth strategy 7 by the government as well as from private entities albeit timings are tight to deliver at scale in 2030s for large co 2 reductions despite the rapid success of decarbonisation additional effort is necessary as further decarbonisation will be more challenging 4c  the rapid progress in the last five years makes up for the previous decade of zero progress on decarbonising electricity britain is therefore just about on track  but emissions must continue to fall at 75 per year there are many technologies for achieving this wind solar biomass new nuclear build and power stations equipped with carbon capture use and storage ccus to keep further decarbonisation affordable it is necessary to assess the suitability of all low carbon generators based on their levelised cost of energy as well as the system integration cost including those technologies that do not receive policy support at the moment figure 26 development of carbon intensity of the electricity grid in great britain past present and future development of interconnectors 212 interconnection britain is an island system with limited connections to neighbouring countries and so traditionally struggles with security of supply issues relative to continental europe virtually all of britains balancing capabilities must be sourced from within the system this has negative impacts on balancing costs as large capitalintensive plants have to remain in standby mode the availability of interconnectors allows sharing of some of the balancing tasks with neighbouring energy systems  technically speaking this means that power plants outside the british system can provide energy to the gb system and vice versa to account for outages or the intermittency of renewables conversely they can increase strain on the system during stress events which affect the two connected markets figure 27 barometer for interconnector capacity the relatively low interconnection capacity to britain is due to the high cost of building undersea cables and the fact interconnectors cannot be viewed as firm capacity or provide the same system services as synchronous power stations the drive for better asset utilisation and renewables integration has led to the construction of interconnectors further expansion is under construction or in final planning stages all of which are due to be operational by 2022 the increase from currently 42 gw 2018 to 178 gw 2022 is more than quadrupling the capacity in a short time period one note of caution is necessary for the projects in planning as the uk may leave the european single energy market which could change the economics of interconnector projects potentially leading to the cancellation of the projects interconnector capacity is set to more than quadruple in the near future if realised these interconnectors provide a large but unreliable increase in system flexibility and allow res balancing with continental europe and scandinavia further expansion beyond 2030 is envisaged however these are competing interconnector projects and are not all likely be realised having a wideranging portfolio of interconnectors to different countries may benefit the energy system as they can be used to balance renewable energy sources across large distances and may reduce costs for consumers through the benefits of trade an unbalanced portfolio exposes both energy systems to each others specific risks and does not allow for economic optimisation the barometer indicates that interconnection capacity is falling behind the target for 2030 however considering the planned upgrades in the next 5 years the development of interconnectors is within the target corridor despite the barometers indication a regional barometer is not presented as interconnection is a countrytocountry issue 213 storage in total 37 gw of storage is active in the gb power system of which 29 gw is pumped hydro 08 gw is batteries primarily lithiumion 04 gw is mechanical flywheels and the rest is thermal storage liquid air and hot water storage the stock of storage is dominated by pumpedhydro storage and new batteries added in the last year batteries and other modern storage technologies are still dependent on specific market rules for economic viability with the recent increase in res penetration and the goal to reduce thermal mustrun capacity for the delivery of ancillary services national grid has encouraged demandside response dsr and storage to participate in the ancillary services markets but still finds itself overwhelmingly dependent on thermal generation figure 28 barometer for storage deployment the gb power system has less storage than most neighbouring countries due to geographical constraints until the mid2010s the only economical storage technology was pumped hydro which requires mountains and thus is concentrated in wales and scotland these still make up the largest share of storage capacity the recent and rapid cost reduction in other storage technologies means that new systems are becoming more widely deployed with small scale rapid dispatch lithiumion batteries contributing the largest share of the new market entrants figure 29 installed storage capacity in the gb power system storage has so far been applied in ancillary services markets which are high value but low volume markets in particular battery storage can be used making it economically viable in these markets but only when generous derating factors are applied this helps to accelerate the cost decline of gridscale storage until eventually it can serve highvolume but loweryield markets economically the gb capacity market has in some cases helped to foster the uptake of storage however the dependency on specific market rules creates uncertainties for longtime investments the barometer indicates that storage deployment is close to being on track however one needs to consider the reliance of storage on markets with specific rules if these were to change the deployment of storage might take a downturn additionally a supportive environment must be maintained into the future as batteries are shortlived relative to pumped hydro eg 1020 rather than 60 plus year lifetimes and so must be repowered at end of life 214 network and transmission capacity expansion grid expansion is necessary to transport electricity between the locations of generation and consumption generator locations are changing due to the shift from fossil to lowcarbon generators but this also changes the generation pattern away from a more constant use of transmission lines towards more intermittent utilisation relocation of generators and the shift towards renewables requires a doubling of grid transmission capacity there are significant risks to the expansion of the electrical network it may face the risk of opposition from local residents and tackling such challenges is a major societal task if we are to proceed with a lowcarbon transition in the power sector assessing the transport capacity at the borders of the unitary regions allows potential shortfalls in transmission capacity to be localised scotland is currently facing the greatest shortfall and portraying it as one unitary region might not accurately cover the full grid expansion needs assuming that grid congestion does not occur within the region is essentially oversimplifying the issues in some cases as scotland does not have limitless internal transmission capacity grid congestion already occurs in scotland especially as wind power plants are typically located in the more rural areas some of which were already troubled by weak grid connections the barometer shows good progress if we assume the already welldeveloped grid as the current state if this is used as a starting point the actual progress of expansion is very little transmission capacity at the borders of the unitary regions will have to double up until 2050 the transmission capacity within the regions is not assessed by the data sources regionally the grid connection reinforcement needs differ largely the east of england faces a fivefold increase in grid capacity which is needed for the transport of electricity from offshore wind farms to the load centres in the region the grid in the north east will need to triple its grid transmission capacity by 2040 to cope with the increasing amount of scottish wind power as well as the possible connection of offshore wind farms in the near future yorkshire will have to double its capacity for the same reasons figure 210 barometer for transmission capacity the east midlands has the second highest transmission capacity and therefore does not require the rapid growth of other regions further north large parts of todays grid congestion in great britain happens in scotland with grid reinforcement requirements additionally potential future nuclear power plants could increase the grid congestion already happening in scotland the siting of wind turbines at the best wind resource locations does not coincide with preexisting location of the grid which lead to frequent grid congestion due to undersizing of the grid there are significant risks to the expansion of the electrical network for example it may face the risk of opposition from local residents and tackling such challenges is a major societal task if we are to proceed with a lowcarbon transition in the power sector 215 smart meter rollout the availability of smart metering is seen as one of the key enablers of a smarter and more balanced grid through the uptake of smallscale demand side response dsr a countrywide rollout of smart meters is envisaged by 2020 this target is conditional in that every property needs to be offered a smart meter by 2020 but the owners are under no legal requirements to accept the smartmeter rollout faces several challenges and significant regional variation varying success can be observed in the rollout with wales leading and london lagging possible reasons for this may be socioeconomic effects eg tenancy structure and technical challenges eg access to meter the target for a complete rollout by 2020 will not be met without rapid acceleration only a third of households currently have a smart meter the current pace would not see rollout finishing until towards 2040 this would prevent the uptake of time of usage tariffs with higher temporal resolution eg 30 minute settlement periods and domestic dsr services in the near future this could have knockon effects such as increased costs for the consumers various challenges are faced by the rollout some are related to use of different types of smart meters with some of them smarter than others boasting additional functionality between the three types of smart meter  amr smets1 and smets2 the automated meter reading amr is a legacy infrastructure for larger electricity customers smets1 is the first generation smart meter with reduced functionality eg not working after supplier change without intervention smets2 is the latest generation with connection to the smart meter gateway currently there are only a few usecases for smart meters and a lack of offerings from the electricity suppliers the initial vision that smart meters will enable dsr services to the grid has yet to fully materialise at the domestic consumer level figure 211 barometer for smart meter rollout nondomestic smart meters account for about 1 of the total numbers however the installed capacity behind those meters is much higher and likely to be more readily available to provide dsr services 216 demand side response demand side response dsr could enable buildings to intelligently reduce their demand at peak times mitigating the need for additional power generation capacity dsr services at the domestic level are mostly limited to legacy economy 7 and 10 the electric loads of a typical household in britain with gas supply for heating usually do not warrant the aggregation in dsr schemes the loads are just too small to be economically viable the smart meter rollout has yet to produce demand side response capacity from households industrial and corporate consumers are actively providing these services already though some energy suppliers now offer smart tariffs for households with electric vehicles and heat pumps these first market entrants however do not make full use of the smart meter infrastructure dsr activity that couples these together may at first be limited to smart charging rather than responding in real time further cost reductions in ict infrastructure and integration of carbased and personal device communication plus aggregation means that we are likely to see domestic dsr developing the ongoing digitalisation could see the use of artificial intelligence ai to predict users behaviour and adjust the energy consumption without a noticeable interruption for the consumer the use of smart meters may reduce the costs for the consumers when dsr services are provided however this will be further down the transition pathway as currently economic benefits are negligible figure 212 barometer for demand side response on the industry and commercial side dsr aggregators are active in the market the high cost of communication infrastructure still makes them reliant on the high value and low volume opportunities such as frequency response markets currently about 2300 mw of dsr is reported to be participating in various markets this constitutes an overachievement with regards to the targets laid out by national grid however there is uncertainty whether the reported capacity is correct the same physical units can be accredited in different ancillary services markets and may be doublecounted if this is the case it would prove that actors are optimising their participation in the market and reacting to price signal as intended ultimately the dsr potential with industrial and corporate consumers is high but it takes a compelling business case to exploit it as dsr must compete with other flexibility options saturation may be reached at lower singledigit gw levels due to diminishing returns in the market and increasing effort of connecting consumers at decreasing unit sizes for pricesensitive industrial and commercial dsr providers this saturation will happen where the cost of connection and potential gains offset the risk of eg lost production in the factory increasing awareness of the benefits of dsr decreasing connection costs and higher intermittency will change this equilibrium and add additional capacity to the system 22 implications of a transitioning power sector overall employment in the conventional energy sector has been steady at around 175000 since the mid1990s after a large decline as the phaseout of coal mining cost more than 300000 jobs around 80000 jobs are directly associated with nonrenewable electricity generation in recent years figure 213 employment in the nonrenewables energy industry figure 214 employees in renewable electricity generation per region data split within england based on decc data investment in renewable energy sources creates more jobs per mwh produced than the thermal generation industry including nuclear an annual share of 75 of the electricity in britain was generated by the nonrenewable generators in 2017 maintaining around 80000 jobs the share of electricity from renewables wind solar bioenergy hydropower was about 25 in 2017 this economic activity supports about additional 34000 jobs the expansion of renewables therefore has a small net positive employment effect the effect is substantially larger when hydropower is removed additionally the employment growth is typically located in more rural areas following the changes in location of electricity generation figure 214 shows how the employment in the renewables sector is distributed across great britain the employment numbers for all of england are split using investment announcements by companies  wales and scotland employment numbers are taken from the ons survey directly most notably yorkshire is hosting a large number of jobs which can be explained with the presence of drax power station as well as with being a major hub for offshore wind power for example the siemensgamesa blade manufacturing for large offshore wind turbines is located in hull chapter 3 energy in transport the overall barometer for transport shows a mixed view targets for the electrification of private car and public bus transport are ontrack along with the infrastructure required for charging these vehicles however it will require a large ramp up in deployment of these technologies in the near future to stay ontrack the story for the sectors transition looks worse for hydrogen deployment heavy duty transport and rail emissions deployment numbers and ghg emission reductions in these areas are behind where they need to be technologies that could benefit these applications are not ontrack to have the infrastructure in place figure 31 progress towards transforming britains transport system highlighting the areas that are under and overperforming relative to nearterm targets for decarbonisation each area is reviewed later in this section transport is behind in reaching its ghg emissions target meaning large transformations eg electrification are required to achieve the 2030 climate targets electric vehicle ev sales are ramping up but the current 04 fleet penetration will need to become 27 by 2030 at an aggregated national level ev charger deployment appears to be on target to deliver enough charging points for the projected ev uptake however there is regional and intraregional clustering of these charging points which will result in shortages and access problems in some areas the electricity network implications of charging infrastructure also require significant investment total cost of ownership tco calculations show that in london battery evs are less expensive than diesel or petrol vehicles the regional variation in tcos is linked to the average distance travelled by private vehicle per year per region and to a lesser extent regional variation in fuel and electricity prices ev owners in wales scotland and the north east face the greatest additional financial burden relative to average income when switching to battery electric and plugin hybrid vehicles rail emissions are currently not on track to achieve decarbonisation targets and progress will likely fall further behind as electrification projects are being abandoned figure 32 total ghg emissions by transport mode in britain from 20082015 31 current status and future targets in transport the energy transition in the transport sector has been relatively slow and limited in 2004 renewable energy biofuels and electricity made up less than 1 of all transport energy by 2016 this figure stood at 35 the transport sector generated 115 mtco 2 e in 2015 accounting for 24 of total emissions figure 32 of this surface transport makes up 95 of these emissions this coupled with current technological innovation suggests that surface transport has the greatest scope for an energy transformation within the transport sector the remainder of this section will provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the surface transport sector and how it is progressing against energy transition targets the focus will be on road transport as opposed to rail as this accounts for around 90 of ghg emissions and passenger kilometres the future sees a transition in transport where ghg emissions are halved evs account for 27 of the personal vehicle fleet electric charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure support the changing vehicle fleet and rail emissions decrease by a quarter all by 2030 air quality concerns and national climate targets are the main drivers of this transition resulting in a variety of lowcarbon options such as electrification and hydrogen other options include biofuels and synthetic fuels which will likely play a role in the transition especially in the shortterm but remain outside the scope of this study the transition up to 2030 will be mostly focussed on privatevehicles with governments and industry already ramping up to achieve future targets electrification of buses heavy good vehicles and rail will be low until 2030 but are expected to achieve large scale deployment nearer 2050 barometer for ghg emission reductions by 2030 surface transport emissions should not exceed 60 mtco 2 e as emissions currently stand at 1118 mtco 2 e there is still a considerable amount of work required by this sector the surface transport system is not reducing emissions fast enough to remain on track to meet its 2030 target progress against the 2030 decarbonisation targets is unequal between regions with london and the north west decarbonising the quickest and the east and east midlands falling the furthest behind this indicates that the energy transition in transport is not occurring at the same rate across the country compared to 2008 transport emissions have decreased by 37 likely a result of the global recession and improved vehicle efficiency as opposed to an energy transformation or fuel switching during this same time renewable energy in transport increased by less than 1 28 in 2008 to 35 in 2016 further between 2010 and 2016 surface transport emissions increased by 11 with 2016 emissions at 1118 mtco 2 e significant decreases will be required to achieve emissions below 60 mtco 2 e by 2030 figures 33 left and 34 right all regions in gb have decreased their surface transport emissions relative to 2008 figure 34 however compared to 2010 the story changes with only four regions decreasing or maintaining their emissions figure 33 this shows the relative importance the recession has played on reducing surface transport emissions in gb since 2008 london compared to both 2008 and 2010 shows the greatest decrease in emissions likely related to efficiency gains in public transport increases in active travel and decreases in road kilometres driven using decarbonisation as a proxy the regions of gb are undergoing energy transitions at unequal rates london has decarbonised at the fastest rate and along with the north west has exceeded the required emissions reductions to be on track to achieve the 2030 emissions target in contrast the east and the east midlands are the furthest behind these regional inequalities could further be amplified if regions continue progressing at these speeds suggesting that some regions will be significantly further behind in the transport energy transition 312 plugin vehicles in the car fleet plugin vehicles are still in their infancy representing only 1 in 50 new car sales and 1 in 250 vehicles on the road however britain is ontrack to achieve plugin vehicle targets which require a 27 share of the private vehicle fleet by 2030 barometer for plugin vehicle penetration electric vehicle sales have dramatically increased since 2011 in all gb regions plugin vehicles are most abundant on the roads of the southern half of britain they are more than threetimes more prevalent in the west midlands as in wales this suggests other barriers are present in the northern regions that is impeding the growth of plugin vehicles plugin vehicle growth has had a 60fold increased since 20117 resulting in their increased share of newly sold vehicles from 0 in 2008 up to 2 by 2018 figure 36 this growth is likely a direct result of evs becoming cheaper and a greater range of vehicles available on the market all regions of gb have significantly increased the number of plugin vehicles on the road since 2011  with the yorkshire and the humber having 200 times more vehicles in 2018 figure 36 plugin vehicles are most abundant in the southern regions of gb this suggests regional factors  eg income availability of chargers driving patterns  are affecting the expansion of plugin vehicles despite recent growth plugin vehicle penetration is less than 1 in 200 vehicles currently on the road this suggests that growth will need to continue along this seemingly exponential trend to ensure that the plugin vehicles account for 27 of all personal vehicles by 2030 regionally the west midlands the east south east and london are leading with plugin vehicle penetration above the 2017 target of 04 however many regions such as wales and the north west are at risk of being left behind in the plugin vehicle transition achieving less than 02 of plugin vehicle penetration this regional disparity could potentially be masked in the future if the national target is achieved through the efforts of only a few key regions figure 36 chart proportion of new car sales that are electric map number of registered plugin vehicles by region 313 ev charging points there are currently over 17000 chargers in great britain of which 3600 are rapid by 2030 there should be over 28000 chargers ev charger deployment is well ahead of schedule to meet the 2030 target but the deployment is highly clustered in cities while all regions have deployed more chargers than required to achieve the indicative 2018 target over 50 are located in london scotland and the south east scotland and london have already deployed more chargers than required by the 2030 target electric charger deployment is on track to achieve its 2030 target ahead of time having already achieved the interim target for 2020 6250 chargers there are currently more rapid chargers in the gb than the target suggests there should be by 2030 to support a growing ev industry 1170 in 2030 versus 3600 in august 2018 further in august 2018 23 of the parkingbased chargers required by 2030 were already installed in britain however these ev chargers are not evenly distributed amongst the british regions with over 50 located in london scotland and the south east this is not particularly surprising for london and the south east as they currently have a large share of the electric vehicles currently on the road scotland on the other hand is one of the lower ranking regions in terms of number of evs on the road the high number of electric chargers could suggest a strong projected growth in battery electric vehicles in the region this could in part be related to the environmental commitments set by the devolved power figure 37 map of the number of electric charging locations 314 hydrogen refuelling stations hydrogen refuelling station deployment is not occurring quickly enough jeopardising the achievement of the 2030 target needed to support a hydrogen transport network 65 hydrogen refuelling stations are required to support an initial hydrogen network in gb there are currently 19 with over half located in london figure 38 map of regional current status apart from london hydrogen refuelling stations are predominantly located on the western side of britain and tend to be relatively clustered the governmentindustry uk h 2 mobility initiative set a target for the number of hydrogen refuelling stations required to support a national hydrogen vehicle fleet by 2030 1150 would be required with intermediate targets of 65 filling stations for 2020 and 330 by 2025 currently there are only 19 hydrogen refuelling stations jeopardising the feasibility of achieving the 2030 target unless considerably more effort is put towards their deployment as with electric chargers though to a more extreme degree the distribution of hydrogen stations is strongly clustered  currently over 50 of refuelling stations are in london a further eight stations are located in western great britain and one on the scottish east coast further the national target for stations was apportioned to each region based on the current number of registered vehicles london and wales are the only regions that are on track to achieve the 2030 target conversely the eastern side of england excluding london does not have any refuelling stations threatening their ability to achieve the 2030 target barometer for hydrogen refuelling stations the location of these stations limits the operation of hydrogenfuelled vehicles and further limits the benefits eg improved air quality of this energy transition to a few clustered areas due to their long distance and high energy requirements heavy goods vehicles hgvs would benefit most from a welldeveloped hydrogen network however the limited deployment and clustering of stations are restricting its use in hgvs 315 electric and hydrogen bus penetration the transition to electric and hydrogen buses in on track to achieve the 2030 target despite making up a low share of the bus fleet electric buses are replacing in part diesel buses coming to the end of their lifetime early battery and hydrogen electric bus fleet penetration is on track even with overall growth of the bus fleet commitments to improving air quality by cities is resulting in an increased share of electric and hydrogen buses in the overall fleet barometer for battery electric and hydrogen buses by 2030 battery electric and hydrogen buses should account for 3 of bus fleet which compared to the plugin vehicle target is relatively small this is related to the longer asset lifetime of the current bus fleet compared to private vehicles and therefore a complete change in the fleet requires more time while electrification transition may be slow the progress is encouraging the absolute number of battery electric and hydrogen buses is increasing at the same rate as its penetration rate of the entire fleet figure 310 this suggests that the increased proportion is due to replacing the existing diesel fleet with electrichydrogen buses rather than from any decrease in the absolute number of buses figure 310 left electric and hydrogen buses blue line and penetration of bus fleet red line right number of ultralow emission buses by region between 2013 and 2018 quarter 1 the share of battery electric and hydrogen buses in each region is affected by the commitments made by cities within each region the east midlands has the greatest share of electric buses compared to any other region nottingham in the east midlands has been an early adopter having just increased their fleet to 58 electric buses cities tend to make their commitments to electric buses due to the air quality improvements they can provide london has seen a 15fold increase between 2013 and 2018 in the number of electric and hydrogen buses which is linked to tfls air pollution commitments the continued transition towards electrified public road transport will depend on cities as currently electric buses have been limited to relatively short routes however with the implementation of a larger hydrogen network across the country nonmetropolitan areas could also benefit from an ultralow emissions bus network 316 ultralow emissions heavy goods vehicles less than 01 of the heavy goods vehicle hgv fleet is considered ultralow emission this is not surprising as the transition is likely to be based around hydrogen fuel which is lacking a developed refuelling network ultralow emissions hgv deployment is limited in britain with only four regions having more than 1 in 1000 heavy goods vehicles on the road progress towards the electrification of hgvs is not on track to achieve the 2030 target where 55 of the hgv fleet must be electrified currently less than a tenth of a per cent of the hgv fleet is considered ultralow emissions this is not unsurprising as hgv technology currently limits its transition to using hydrogen which as discussed previously is lacking a developed infrastructure however companies such as tesla daimler volkswagen and thor trucks have unveiled plans to produce electric hgv vehicles with tesla aiming to start production as soon as 2019 these future technological advancements could help great britain achieve its target but this will be dependent on when these vehicles are commercially rolledout barometer for ultralow emission hgvs regionally the south east north west and scotland have the greatest proportion of ultralow emission hgvs these regions are equipped with or are near hydrogen refuelling stations wales on the other hand has over 10 of british hydrogen refuelling stations but have one of the lowest share of ultralow emission hgvs in its fleet this is likely explained by the fact that these hydrogen refuelling stations are located at universitiesresearch centre and therefore are not likely to play a large role in ensuring an uninterrupted hydrogen network further it is important to note that differences between regions are very small and all regions are at risk of not achieving the 2030 target 317 rail emissions rail emissions have decreased by only 1 since 2010 suggesting the industry is falling well behind the progress needed to achieve the 2030 target abandoned electrification plans are jeopardising the achievement of the 2030 rail emissions target the proportion of electrified rail has only modestly increased since 1985 allowing only a small segment of the rail network to benefit from a decarbonising power sector by 2030 the rail industry needs to reduce its direct and indirect emissions by 25 as compared to 2010 emissions reductions will likely occur in an exponential fashion due to the inertia of the industry and the relatively long timeframes required to complete infrastructure improvements it is therefore more likely that emissions reductions will occur in large discrete steps rather than constant yearly reductions however since 2010 emissions in rail have only decreased by 1 suggesting that there is still considerably more work required to achieve the 2030 target barometer for rail emission reductions top national progress above share of electrified railways across britain over the last three decades figure 312 map of britains railway lines with colours to signify existing or proposed electrified lines and grey to signify diesel to remain in line with the target emissions will need to start falling due to greater overhead electrification and increased use of bimodal d  battery and hydrogen trains as well as the use of other low carbon fuels as the target includes both direct and indirect emissions the sector could benefit from increasing the proportion of railways that are electrified to capture the falling carbon intensity of the power sector however there has been very modest progress towards railway electrification in the last 30 years figure 312 the proportion of electrified rail in a year is sensitive to the completion of electrification projects the recently abandoned overhead electrification plans on the great western main line midland main line and lake line suggests that the proportion of electrified rail will not dramatically increase in the near future jeopardising the 2030 target but the government does suggest that trains on these lines could be battery and hydrogen powered while the proportion of electrified rail will increase with the completion of high speed 2 this is not expected to be completed before the late 2020s and therefore its contribution towards achieving the target could be limited especially if there are any completion delays further part of the remaining regions to electrify are too remote and therefore the business case for electrification is not strong 32 implications of a transitioning transport sector 321 total cost of car ownership passenger vehicles a regional analysis of the total cost of ownership tco of conventional petrol and diesel battery electric bev and plugin hybrid electric phev reveals which regions will incur a greater financial burden from electrification this investigates the impacts of regional differences eg driving habits fuel costs on the tco of privatelyowned vehicles appendix 1 provides an overview of the methodology while appendix 2 provides further analysis of the results the tco gap is the difference in the lifetime cost of owning one vehicle over another at a national level the tco gap is greatest between a petrol vehicle and a phev 6200 and is the smallest between a diesel vehicle and a bev 1900 the regional variation in tco is strongly related to the regional differences in kilometres driven and to a smaller extent the regional variation in fuel cost prices ie electricity petrol and diesel the annual distance travelled by each vehicle impacts its fuel requirements depreciation rate and maintenance cost further recent changes to the plugin grant scheme bevs as of the beginning of november 2018 will receive 3500 instead of 4500 and phevs will no longer receive any subsidy previously 2500  has increased the tco gap between these electric cars and fossil fuelled ones prior to this change the tco gap between a petrol vehicle and phev was 3700 and between a diesel and bev was 900 irrespective of vehicle type or changes in the grant scheme the tco gap is highest in wales and scotland and lowest in london figure 313 figure 313 regional tco gaps between conventional and plugin vehicles in london unlike other regions private vehicle use is not the main commuting mode resulting in lower annual driving distances and subsequently lower tcos further london has implemented an additional tax  the congestion charge  from which plugin vehicles are exempt as a result of this driving pattern and the additional charge on diesel and petrol vehicles in london the tco of a bev is lower than diesel vehicles prior to the change of the plugin grant scheme the tco of a bev was also lower than a petrol vehicle in london further this research assumed that a vehicle would only enter into the congestion charge zone eight times in the year however if travelled into every working day the annual cost of a petrol and diesel vehicle would increase by up to 3000 therefore due to the additional 9000 cost that would be incurred over a 3year period for fossil cars the tco of phevs becomes lower than fossilfuelled vehicles in london if similar schemes were introduced in other regions it could significantly improve the economics of bevs and phevs bringing them closer or even below cost parity with petrol and diesel vehicles battery electric vehicles are already cheaper than petrol and diesel cars in london this is related to fewer kilometres driven and the additional congestion charge while the tco gaps may suggest bevs and to a lesser extent phevs are approaching cost parity with conventional vehicles there are additional concerns that could further hinder the deployment of these electrified vehicles the initial cost including the plugin grant of bevs and phevs used in this analysis are up to twice the price of petrol and diesel cars this significantly larger upfront cost can negatively impact the uptake of plugin vehicles even if tco costs were relatively similar this is especially true for lower gross income households though the burden of a high initial cost could be slightly dampened if vehicles are financed in general the availability of charging facilities correlates with the uptake of electric vehicles across gb this is evident when looking at wales which has the fewest electric charging facilities and the lowest ev share in its fleet scotland on the other hand is an exception where the high share of british ev chargers are offset by the high tco costs of plugin vehicles this suggests that in some cases costs issues outrank a high charger availability as london is currently the only region where switching to bevs produces a financial benefit against diesel vehicle ownership it is best suited to continue pursuing the transition towards an electrified private car vehicle fleet additional measures eg congestion charge could be implemented in other regions to even out tco barriers giving regions the same opportunities to progress along the electrified private vehicle transition 322 availability of electric vehicle charging points london scotland and the north east have a low ratio of number of evs per available charging point linked to having a higher proportion of ev chargers andor a smaller absolute number of evs figure 314 the east of england and the west midlands have much higher ratios suggesting greater competition for charging however this competition would not be as acute if ev penetration had not exceeded the 2017 modelled penetration of 04 of the fleet this potentially suggests that in these regions the number of evs is growing rapidly but is not being matched by charging infrastructure on the other hand if ev penetration in wales had achieved 04 in 2017 it would have seen much greater competition for their ev chargers at 11 vehicles per charger the regional variations in the number of evs per charger would become even more pronounced by 2030 with competition being as low as 125 cars per charger in london to as high as of 590 cars per charger in the west midlands this competition will greatly affect vehicles owners who do not have private athome charging this competition would be amplified by overnight charging if owners utilised these public points for such charging patterns as vehicles will remain in these limited spots for longer periods denying access to other vehicles therefore this projected competition appears to suggest that the 27000 ev charger target may not be sufficient to support the ev deployment competition for ev chargers will become more acute if ev penetration targets are achieved this is likely to be especially true in cities where more vehicle owners will not have private access to charging infrastructure the average distance between a home and the nearest charger will affect at least in part how a consumer perceives the ease of use of an ev london has the lowest average distance between a home and a charger which is not surprising given the high number of ev chargers and the high density of homes figure 314 wales on the other hand has the largest average distance between chargers and homes this could again partly explain along with the higher tco of plugin vehicles why uptake of evs in wales is lagging every other region figure 315 average distance from households to the nearest ev charging point both rapid or slow the average distance to an ev charger for british regions ranges between 08km and 37km suggesting that charging facilities should not be a barrier to ev uptake given current technology figure 315 however when investigating in further detail where these chargers are located it is not very surprising to find them clustered around cities  where population and vehicle densities are highest and where people have limited opportunities for private charging ie do not have private garagesdriveways this suggests that anxieties over charging facilities may in part be dampened in cities but will remain present if not stronger in rural areas where distances to chargers may be far greater rural areas and nonmetropolitan regions are therefore at risk of behind left behind in the transition towards privatevehicle electrification a particular example of this is seen in scotland which has large areas without any charging points particularly in the highlands nonetheless the average scot is closer to a charging point than people in most english regions this is because chargers in scotland are heavily concentrated within glasgow edinburgh dundee and aberdeen giving good coverage for most but some people will be left more than 50 km away from any charging infrastructure the increase in evs will have impacts on network loads as the consumption of one vehicle is equivalent to an additional home there is potential for these vehicles to charge overnight when current demand is lowest however this will likely further change the demand profile further owners will likely plug in their cars when they are parked rather than returning to plug them in when demand is lowest in this case there is potential to delay or offset charging times through smart charging to ease peak demand vehicle to grid v2g has been suggested as an extension to smart charging which would enable electricity stored in evs to be fed back into the grid at times of peak demand regions with less ev penetration and charger deployment could miss out on any benefit available from smart charging and v2g this could mean more investment in grid reinforcement in these regions with the cost being passed onto the consumers 323 railway investment in 201617 155 billion was spent on maintaining and improving the british rail sector with threequarters of the funding from central government and the remainder from local government and private corporations there are however large regional disparities in where these funds are allocated london received almost 50 of the total monetary input 68 billion while the north east received less than 2 290 million when normalised by the total number of journeys taken in that same year the north east followed by wales and the south west invested the most per journey whereas the east south east and london all spent the least per passenger journey figure 316 london spends more on railways than any other gb region but the north east spends the most per passenger train journey when comparing figure 316 to the electrification map figure 312 railway spending electrification and spend per passenger journey appear to be correlated generally regions  such as london the south east and the north west  that have the highest absolute spend on rail are also the regions with the lowest spend per journey due to high frequency of journeys and have a large portion of the electric rail network the reverse is generally true for regions with low absolute rail investment  such as wales the north east and the south west figure 316 railway investment in absolute terms and per passenger journey this suggests that despite the documented large upfront cost electrification can be economically viable in the longterm especially on routes with high passenger frequency there are also additional benefits linked to greater investment in electrification such as reduced journey times quieter journeys and increased passenger use these rail investments can therefore lead to modal shifts which could result in even further ghg savings especially if passengers are moving from private fossilbased transportation chapter 4 energy in buildings domestic buildings are a highcarbon sector due to heating 83 of household energy is used for space and water heating for economic and environmental reasons this is clearly the area to focus upon domestic energy efficiency is lagging behind targets and nondomestic energy efficiency targets do not exist scotland benefits from the largest share of high energy efficiency houses whilst wales has the poorest performing housing stock this has a large effect on energy bills especially with electric heating which can have significantly higher costs than oil or gas low energy efficiency is also linked to fuel poverty however this correlation is hard to see with the averaged out regional data fuel poverty has been fairly even across britain but it is generally more prevalent in northern regions than southern ones matching the trends in household income few lowcarbon heating systems eg heat pumps have been installed so far large deployment targets to 2030 will require a very rapid scale up this will affect the cost of energy for each region differently depending on the housing composition electric heating is generally more expensive than ongrid gas and oil at current prices changing heating technology is capital intensive and is much more achievable in nonrental housing unless the right policy conditions are in place putting more stress on lowincome households that rent southern england and scotland spend the most on domestic energy however northern england and scotland spend more of their income on energy than in the south the difference in average spend by local authority area varies by approximately 750 per year extreme electrification in the future could benefit energy spend in scotland and the southwest while increasing costs for midland and northern regions of england there are already high levels of electrification in nondomestic buildings the south of england is the most electrified part of britain in this subsector london and the south spend less on energy relative to gross value added making companies in these regions less susceptible to changes in the energy system figure 41 progress towards transforming britains buildings highlighting the areas that are under and overperforming relative to nearterm targets for decarbonisation each area is reviewed later in this section 41 overall buildings current status and future targets the energy transition in buildings is primarily driven by the cost of energy and climate policy the sector has seen many initiatives eg green deal over the past decade to facilitate the reduction of demand with the aim that these will bring lower energy bills and lower ghg emissions there are two main subsectors within buildings domestic and nondomestic the latter comprising of commercial and public buildings but not industrial or agricultural buildings electrification in buildings currently makes up about 35 of total consumption see figure 13 there is a large difference between the buildings subsectors commercial buildings utilise electricity for approximately 50 of their energy use whereas domestic buildings only use just above 20 public buildings are only slightly more electrified at just below 30 the direct ghg emission reductions in all buildings are on track to achieve the 2030 target for direct emissions reductions are either achieved by reducing consumption of energy outside of electricity or fuel switching to electricity the factors affecting these methods are investigated in the following sections where domestic and nondomestic buildings are considered separately towards a 2030 future a combination of a change to lowcarbon heating technologies and increasing energy efficiency will drive a reduction in direct ghg emissions from this sector electrification of heating is one method to achieve decarbonisation in buildings  shifting the emissions burden from the buildings sector to the power sector although a viable option the economics and practicalities of electrification for heating versus a range of other lowcarbon options such as hydrogen and biomass is still unclear the exact individual contributions of each of these technologies to a lowcarbon buildings sector will become clearer through the 2020s where policies will be implemented to reach climate targets and rapidly falling costs of renewable generation technologies the electrification through heat pumps is forecasted to become common place throughout british homes with a predicted 1 in 12 households utilising this technology in 2030 at the same time this will be supported by an energy efficient housing stock with approximately 3 out of 4 houses having an energy performance certificate above a band c this improvement will help to lower consumption reducing energy bills or soften any possible increases in the cost of heating through alternative technologies and fuels the lack of available data and targets leave the future energy transition in buildings unclear with even the current state of energy in buildings being relatively difficult to determine when compared to other sectors this is particularly evident in nondomestic buildings where little information on the subsectors progress exists elevated levels of heating electrification in nondomestic buildings is likely to be a good option for further decarbonisation although increases in commercial energy spend may affect businesses in some region more than others 42 current status and future targets for domestic buildings 421 domestic ghg emissions the reduction of direct ghg emissions from domestic buildings is on track direct emissions reductions have mainly been achieved through reducing consumption by increasing energy efficiency and by switching heating to cleaner fuels or to electricity where it is then accounted for in indirect emissions  the power sector over 80 of energy used in homes is for heating  suggesting large potential for continued decarbonisation these options have been supported by government policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency eg energy company obligation and lowcarbon energy technologies in homes eg through the renewable heat incentive figure 42 barometer for direct ghg emissions from domestic buildings heating space and water dominates domestic energy usage accounting for over 80 of total domestic building energy demand lighting and appliances are 100 electrified whereas cooking still uses fossil fuels in many homes but can be electrified with relative ease4 heating water and space is predominately achieved through the combustion of fossil fuels but electric replacements are usually less straightforward and can be more expensive most of the economic and environmental savings in domestic buildings can be achieved by increasing their thermal energy efficiency andor by switching heating technologies and fuels there is potential of decreasing direct emissions further through electrification of heating or other lowcarbon options however the additional indirect emissions could result in an overall netincrease if power sector does not decarbonise fast enough the following sections now focus on these efficiency and heating technologies measures as well as their socioeconomic implications 422 energy efficiency the energy performance certificate ratings of buildings is currently behind where modelling predicts it needs to be although it is within 90 of the 2018 target homes in scotland and south east england have the highest energy efficiency while wales the lowest efficiency homes a high proportion of the emission reductions required to reach the ccc 2030 ghg target is apportioned to energy efficiency measures total buildings ghg reductions by 2030 must be 26 for domestic and 21 for nondomestic users this emphasises the importance of energy efficiency measures to achieve the overall targets figure 43 barometer for energy efficiency by energy performance certificate epc ratings top national progress above regional progress figure 44 regional analysis of energy efficiency ratings the range in the average regional proportions only varies by approximately 10 yorkshire the east midlands and the southwest have lower energy efficient homes than the south of england and scotland scotland has the highest energy efficiency homes and has benefitted from strong government agenda to support on the issue initially through advice and education other reasons for the regional differences are unclear but may include the age of the properties newer houses have a better performance on average than older ones with more new homes built in the southern more efficient regions also the affordability of energy efficiency improvement measures can be a barrier as the areas with lower efficiency typically have lower household income figure 44 regional analysis of energy efficiency ratings generally speaking the regions with the most epc ratings of f and g have the lowest proportion of epc ratings of c and above scotland has the most households with high epc ratings and wales and yorkshire have the least the level of low epc ratings has a correlation with population density with the more rural areas having a higher proportion than the urbanised areas as buildings transition to cleaner heating technologies energy efficiency will be important in keeping household energy bills down electric or low carbon heating sources can be more expensive than current heating see section 0 so increases in efficiency are important to offset these costs the current lowest efficiency homes are found in areas with lower incomes and therefore would be more sensitive to energy cost increases  highlighting the importance for action to mitigate this effect in the future 423 fuel poverty poor energy efficiency in homes is often linked to fuel poverty as household bills can become too high to maintain a level of comfort 11 of households in britain are fuelpoor there is small approximately 5 at the most variation in the proportions of fuel poor homes in each region although it is important to note even these small percentage changes means thousands or even tensofthousands of homes the midlands northern england and scotland had the worst fuel poverty rates in gb between 2012 and 2016 for fuel poverty an interim target was not included as the eradication of fuel poor homes as soon as possible should be the objective the political nature of this metric means that there are no milestones available for 2018 therefore the status of fuel poverty in britain was deemed to be not ontrack figure 45 map of current status the devolved powers calculate fuel poverty through different methodologies in figure 45 the results are shown using the lowincome highcost methodology lihc which is used by england but applied to scotland and wales however using one methodology to calculate fuel poverty that is consistent and comparable between all the devolved powers would be useful for effective policies and measurement of progress using the nationalspecific methodologies scotland has a 34 rate of fuel poverty and wales 23  significantly higher proportions than those identified by the lihc method this is important as it dictates how many households get additional funding but does not give a consistent comparison across britain other factors linked to fuel poverty are usually income and the ownership status of the property  whether it is let to a tenant or owned by the occupant the restrictions of upgrading a let property means that the tenant may not be able to implement any improvements landlords do not gain enough value themselves to implement the measures and vice versa for the tenants 38 of homes are rented meaning large proportions of the population are subject to these restrictions barometer for fuel poverty scotland although having higher energy efficiency has a midrange value for proportion of fuel poor homes when compared to the rest of the country in the lihc method this could be caused by the low average income per household in this region as well as climatic factors there are generally higher fuel poverty rates in the northern and midland regions of england and also scotland supporting the income per household and climatic variation reasoning the averaging of household income and fuel poverty rates across a region like the south west could be masking information about the spread and difference in wealth there are large areas of relative poverty in the south west and this could also be driving the fuel poverty rate in this region similarly the highest proportion of fuel poor homes seen in the west midlands could also be affected by the same reasoning of that in the south west the midlands and the northern regions of england have some of the lowest shares of homes with epc ratings c and above suggesting that this negatively affects the share of fuel poor homes in this region negatively however the west midlands although having the highest fuel poverty rates also has one of the lowest proportions of homes with epc rates f and g the lowest ratings this confirms that although poor energy efficiency is linked to fuel poverty there are other factors in these regional averages that have a significant effect on the levels of fuel poverty 424 electrification of heating the electrification of heating is one option to potentially reduce the climate impact of energy use in homes heating is currently 8 electrified and ontrack to reach 2030 target electric heating penetration is highest in scotland and the south west where there are high proportions of offgas grid households however whether electrification of heating will reduce household energy bills depends on many factors including the efficiency of the heating technology the price of electricity and the efficiency of the home in gb over 75 of households are connected to the gas grid the use of efficient boilers in homes connected to the gas grid has helped see emissions reductions however further decarbonisation with gas combustion technology is highly limited raising questions on what technology will proliferate in a low carbon energy transition the future of heating is still under debate the main options touted are electric heating biomass and hydrogen with varying degrees of hybridisation and coexistence electric heating eg storage heaters is not a new technology barometer for electrification of heating top national progress above regional progress however there are questions over the efficiency and affordability of these older technologies given the current electricity price higher when compared to gas and oil and the efficiency of the current housing stock newer technologies are considered viable notably heat pumps claiming high efficiencies potential heating bill decreases and fewer carbon emissions there are two types of heat pumps airsource ashp and groundsource gshp where gshps have higher efficiencies but require larger amounts of land and are more costly to install as with all electrification technologies emissions depend on the carbon intensity of the power system and would be accounted for in the power sector reducing buildings direct emissions there is a split regionally in share of electric heat with scotland and the south of england being above the national average of 8 the remainder of britain the midlands north of england and wales are below it there is a greater variation ranging from 025 of homes using electric heat when analysed at a local authority level the extremities of britain are the most electrified with the highlands and islands of scotland seeing up to 25 electric heating the most westerly tip of the southwest also having high proportions this is mainly due to the lack of gas grid connection in these areas see appendix 3 as the energy system in britain transforms the areas with high penetrations of electric heat are susceptible to any changes in electricity price  especially as the majority of current electrification of heating is not through the high efficiency options such as heat pumps price rises will have a greater impact on those households which use the most electricity 425 heat pump deployment the ccc model that 22 million heat pumps should be deployed by 2030 rising to 58 million by 2035 this assumes a costoptimised deployment rate of over 400000 heat pumps per year in 2030 and 900000 per year in 2035 for context britain installed approximately 6500 heat pumps last year heat pump deployment is not ontrack currently 1 in 650 homes has a heat pump this must rise to 1 in 12 by 2030 scotland and the south west are ahead of target deployment of heat pumps whilst all other regions are behind this is likely because the installation of heat pumps is most attractive practically and economically in areas with high off gasgrid houses london is only at 5 towards its 2018 interim target heat pumps deployed in 2017 totalled 40989 units 31882 as airsource heat pumps ashp and 9107 groundsourced heat pumps gshp according to ccc modelling to achieve climate targets there should be should behave been 65000 heat installed by 2017 therefore suggesting current deployment is not on target the current installation rate of approximately 6500 per year is much lower than the modelled 28000 per year in 2017 heat pump installation is expected to ramp up during the 2020s and any delay could be compounded making targets difficult to reach barometer for heat pump deployment top national progress above regional progress figure 47 map of current deployment of all lowcarbon heating technologies including biomass and solar thermal aside from heat pumps there are other lowcarbon technologies biomass boilers and solar thermal only for water heating scotland has high biomass deployment as well as ashp possibly related to the large share of offgas grid homes in the northern part of the region further the south west also has high deployment of lowcarbon heating technologies figure 47 in contrast there are lower levels of deployment in the midlands and northern parts of england these areas have a high penetration of gas grid connections and on average lower household income the latter may limit the ability to afford the high upfront capital costs of lowcarbon heating london has significantly lower deployment of low carbon technologies even though the proportion of houses off the gasgrid is similar to the rest of the country this may be down to the number of homes owned compared to rented heat pumps and especially biomass boilers with fuel storage are large and in urban settings space comes at a premium or is not available  for example in blocks of flats therefore installation of these lowcarbon technologies may not be practical there are further air quality concerns about biomass boilers within urbanised areas such as central london these urbanised areas could benefit from support of other heating technologies not discussed here such as district heating systems scotland and the south west have the most lowcarbon heating deployments however lowcarbon heating penetration is below 1 in every region of britain the overall percentages of lowcarbon heating are very low and even lower for just heat pumps this shows when compared with the electrification share in figure 46 a very small proportion are these efficient electrical heating technologies and will instead be utilising less efficient technologies such as storage heaters this will have a negative effect on the cost of energy for those areas with high inefficient electrification see section 424 43 implications for household consumers this section extracts some of the socioeconomic factors of the current energy system for buildings and suggests a view of what a future may look like with further transformation 431 household energy costs the current energy system outlined in the previous section results in the costs to domestic consumers shown in figure 48 household spend was calculated by using electricity and gas retail prices per region fixed yearly electricity and gas cost per region electricity and gas consumption by local authority and number of houses per local authority the regional map shows that household costs on average only vary by 180 across gb scotland and the southeast have the highest prices however at local authority level there are variations of over 1000 in household energy spending the energy spend in central london is very low 800 whereas on the outskirts into the south east the costs can be almost twice as high this is likely related to the types of housing in each are with central london featuring smaller flats and terraced housing compared to larger detached properties of the south east low costs are also seen in midwales and along the east coast of england particularly in yorkshire and the humber and the north east regions wales has a high proportion of offgas grid homes but does not have a high penetration of electric heat the northern regions in england have high share of ongas grid properties and therefore benefit from low cost heat southern england and scotland spend the most on domestic energy the difference in average local authority spend varies by around 1000 average household spend on energy share of household income spent on energy figure 48 average household spend on energy by region and local authority the highlands and the particularly the west coast of scotland are high energy spend regions which correlates with a high level of offgas grid homes using electric and lower average temperatures the share of income spent on energy increases outside of london the south east and east regions figure 48 the higher income regions spend a smaller proportion of their income on energy as the difference in energy spend between regions is small but the difference in household income is much larger generally the energy spend as a share of income is higher in scotland than it is for england and wales 432 changes in household energy costs to see what the implications of further energy transformations in buildings could look like a future with high lowcarbon heating uptake was modelled it was assumed that all standard ongas grid homes use gas boilers and all standard offgas grid homes that are not electric or biomass already use oil boilers there is also a carbon price incorporated in the future heating costs the results show that lowcarbon options can be cheaper for offgas grid homes compared to those on gasgrid figure 49 figure 49 the levelised cost of alternative heating systems in 2030 and 2050 relative to gas boilers left and oil boilers right a change in average energy spend per home by region to 2030 is shown in figure 410 for each of the selected new lowcarbon technologies further explanation of the calculation and assumptions is detailed in appendix 3 in general a fullswitch to a lowcarbon technology could significantly increase energy spend even with the carbon pricing included in these cost estimates figure 410 this increase ranges from 20 for ashp and biomass technologies to over 70 and potentially 100 for gshp and conventional electric technologies overall ashp is the cheapest lowcarbon option for all regions under these parameters biomass is more expensive but competitiveness and costs may vary regionally these costs assume that there are no efficiency upgrades keeping the heat demand constant however the additional cost of running electric or other alternative heating technologies would benefit from energy efficiency upgrades to homes figure 410 average change in household energy spend from installing new lowcarbon technologies 0 implies no change when moving from a gas boiler ashp  air source heat pump gshp  ground source heat pump largescale electrification of gas and oil heating using ashp could produce regionally winners and losers with scotland and the south west reducing their energy spend by switching with a focus on ashp as the cheapest option figure 411 visualises how the energy spend will change by region as the system is transformed through removing natural gas and oil heating completely applying carbon pricing and electrifying through ashp this gives an indicative view of how energy spend will change through technology changes scotland and south west look to benefit from the assumed switching with regions in the north of england being worse off this is mainly due to the current level of spend on energy with northern and midland regions of england having strong gasgrid connection providing a cheap heating option the switch to ashp for these regions makes it more expensive in scotland and the south west there are currently a lot of offgas grid homes utilising oil boilers the switch to ashp in these regions results in cheaper energy bills when considering carbon pricing up to 2030 figure 411 change in energy spend by region 44 current status and future targets for nondomestic buildings 441 nondomestic ghg emissions nondomestic buildings are behind on the reductions needed to be ontrack for the 2030 target the high level of electrification see section 13 in nondomestic buildings means that direct emissions are relatively low compared to domestic and other sectors the reduction of direct nondomestic buildings emissions is not ontrack to meet 2030 targets apart from the ghg reduction target very few targets exist for nondomestic buildings this further reflects the relatively slow progress towards emissions reductions in the nondomestic building sector figure 412 barometer for direct ghg emissions in nondomestic buildings 442 energy usage in nondomestic buildings the current status of energy supply to nondomestic buildings can be seen by using electricity and gas meters as a proxy figure 413 figure 413 the number of nondomestic electric and gas meters in each region with the share of solely electric properties nondomestic buildings in south england scotland and wales are more highly electrified than the northern regions meaning the latters commercial and public sectors are more susceptible to changes in electricity prices further electrification of this sector would result in direct emissions reductions however this would only result in overall emission reductions if the power sector carbon intensity targets are reached the cost of this electricity depends on the technologies in the grid mix and the supplydemand balance of electricity possible rises in electricity costs in the future leave the highly electrified regions more open to cost increases however if strong carbon pricing is implemented the same could happen to the regions with lowelectrification there is a large proportion of solely electric nondomestic buildings especially in london the south east and the north west figure 414 final energy consumption in 2016 of public commercial subsectors and the total nondomestic sector as a  of total energy consumption by subsector there are large proportions of nondomestic buildings without gas meters however public yellow and commercial red buildings used as much electricity as natural gas in 2016 438 and 434 share of primary energy consumption respectively this shows that those buildings with access to gas have high gas consumption public buildings used more gas than electricity the opposite is seen in commercial buildings it is assumed that public buildings are in general older buildings with lower heating efficiencies that are more likely to be connected to the gas grid therefore require high gas demands commercial buildings are more likely to use air conditioning and electric heating units to satisfy their heating demands the average for the nondomestic sector orange varies by application and is always between the public and commercial share 443 nondomestic energy efficiency as with domestic buildings energy efficiency is a key part of impacting the economic and climate performance of the nondomestic subsector together with the type of energy and technologies supplying energy services to buildings that were discussed above currently 36 of nondomestic properties have epc ratings of at least a c there are no targets or modelling that exist for nondomestic energy efficiency ratings so it is assumed that the energy efficiency ratings of nondomestic buildings need to reach the same target by 2030 and at the same rate as domestic energy efficiency figure 415 this results in the nondomestic energy efficiency target being not ontrack to reach 2030 targets figure 415 barometer for energy efficiency in nondomestic buildings 45 implications for business costs and competitiveness the characteristics of the regions commercial composition and the energy system can have implications on the competitiveness of businesses in the region due to commercial and public sector costs spend on energy as a proportion of the regions gross value added gva was calculated figure 416 all commercial and public activities were included in the gva the southern regions spend a less on energy per economic output than northern regions london spends the least and wales spends the most figure 416 change from national average of energy spend as a proportion of commercial gva in general the northern regions of england and wales spend more on energy per economic output compared to scotland and the southern regions of england london has the lowest energy spend per gva in britain business sectors such as financial services tend to have very high gva outputs with low energy spend requirements in office buildings conversely nonmetropolitan regions tend to have less of these highyield lowenergy spend business sectors for example energy spend per gva in wales is significantly higher than the rest of britain and is due to low gva from its commercial and public sectors as well as relatively high energy spend comparatively the north east has the smallest commercial and public gva but a lower energy spend than wales these highenergy lowoutput regions will be more susceptible to changes in energy cost with profit margins of the nondomestic commercial building occupants potentially greatly affected the region that are most at risk are the northern regions of england the midlands and wales the future cost of energy for nondomestic buildings depends on the level of electrification and the effect of transformations in the power sector and other consuming sectors on electricity prices as well as the prices of other fuels increases in the energy efficiency of nondomestic buildings and the installation of more efficient technologies could see a decrease in the energy spend in these properties bringing economic benefit to the commercial and public entities that use them chapter 5 energy in industry 51 overview industry is a difficult sector to transform as there are many economic and technological barriers and there are no robust targets for the industrial sectors energy transition beyond ghg reduction as a whole british industry has decoupled its economic growth from the emission of ghgs currently placing it on track to reach climate targets absolute electricity use in industry has stayed constant while its share has increased as processes have been electrified and efficiency increases have been implemented the top 10 energy consuming industries have varying degrees of electrification at this point many processes have been optimised for cost it is theoretically possible to increase electrification but this will increase energy costs significantly this would make british industry uncompetitive unless carbon pricing revenue is recouped north west midlands and south east are most at risk to losing jobs because of automation as these are the most industrialised areas in the country over 500000 jobs are at risk in manufacturing mining and quarrying water and waste see section 532 which would have significant impacts on the energy demand of the industrial sector 52 current status the energy transition in the industrial sector is generally more complex than in other sectors some industrial processes are very energy intensive especially those that use high temperatures so their decarbonisation is difficult because electric power does not always make economic sense for these applications britain has also seen much of its energyintensive industry dwindle moving to other countries where energy is cheaper final products are increasingly imported with a risk of carbon leakage which is not considered in this report industry is difficult to transform as there are many economic and technological barriers the transition in industry is very much economicsled with the variety of industrial processes business structures and international competition making it difficult to prescribe targets and blanket regulation there are far fewer targets that can be formed into metrics when compared with the power transport and buildings sectors as 35 of the industrial sectors energy corresponds to a third of total electricity produced a substantial increase in electrification could have a large effect on overall electricity demand affecting the electricity market there are trends that are driving electrification for industry such as automation and pressure from climate targets to reduce emissions however there are also other transformations industry can make to reduce its direct emissions such as the implementation of carbon capture use and storage ccus therefore the industrial sector has huge potential for change although the exact direction is still yet to be seen 521 industrial sector emissions and energy use ghg emissions in industry have approximately halved since 1990 figure 51 the mining of coal and lignite petrochemical manufacturing and waste services have significantly reduced their emissions although this is mainly caused by decreases in industrial activity in these sectors figure 51 ghg emissions from industry 19902016 greenhouse gas emissions are decoupled from economic growth in britains industrial sector figure 52 ghg emissions per gross value added while economic output in industry has been increasing since 1990 greenhouse gas emissions linked to industry have been decreasing industrial emissions intensity normalised by gross value added gva has decreased since 1990 figure 52  a decoupling of growth and emissions it is likely that a portion of the decrease in emissions was linked to the greening of energy use as energy consumption remained relatively stable until 2006 while emissions decreased during that time the subsequent emissions decrease is likely due to an interplay of less carbon intensive energy use and increased energy efficiency however despite economic growth from 1990 changes to the carbon intensity are also due to the changing composition of industry with british moving away from some more carbon intensive sectors such as steelmaking to less carbon intensive ones industry has seen substantial decreases in ghg emissions and is ontrack to reach 2030 targets this has been achieved by a mixture of emission reductions measures as well as the relocation of industry to other countries the ccc fifth carbon budget provides a 2030 target for industrial emissions at 80 mtco 2 e of direct emissions per year when using ccc data to form a 2017 target british industry is ahead of schedule in abating direct emissions figure 53 however this target does not consider the emissions associated with electricity usage therefore if industry is switching its energy consumption from fuels such as coal oil or natural gas to electricity the process is essentially considered to be emissions free it is possible to then say that some of the emissions decrease can be linked to fuel switching to electricity figure 53 barometer of industrial ghg emissions showing progression towards 2030 target figure 54 consumption by fuel type for industrial sector 20022016 in 2017 the industrial sector emitted 105 mtco 2 e down from 117 mtco 2 e in 2008 figure 54 illustrates that there has not been an absolute increase of electricity use in industry which has remained fairly constant since 2002 the complexity of industrial change means that electrification of industries may be taking place without it reflecting in an increase in overall electricity consumption any efficiency increases could also be masking an increase in electrification of industry the highlevel data available cannot resolve these factors whilst there has been a reduction in solid fuel use in most other sectors industry still relies upon it for a significant proportion of its energy consumption with solid fuels absolute energy consumption staying relatively constant since 2002 total energy consumption reduced around the financial crash and has never recovered signalling that this either caused a transition in industrial processes or some of  the mainly natural gas and oil consuming  industries have closed down 522 the top 10 consuming industries the top ten energy consuming industries have a large variety in the percentage of electricity usage figure 55 each industry will have a theoretical maximum electrification potential due to technological barriers as well as system integration barriers whereby a certain process may depend on another process using a certain fuel figure 55 consumption of top 10 industrial consuming subsectors and their penetration of electrification the manufacture of coke and petroleum products and nonmetallic mineral products have the lowest electrification some further electrification in these subsectors if technologically feasible could help to reduce industrial emissions as these are high consuming sectors similarly chemical and food production electrification would also be beneficial water services are almost completely electrified already this is due to the processes relying mainly on electric pumps some of the highest energy consuming industrial subsectors have low electricity consumption showing that if further electrification could be applied it would yield large carbon reductions 523 industry by region there is regional variation in the number of industrial companies in britain with the north east and wales having the fewest companies figure 56 whereas the highest number are in the south east west midlands and the north west figure 56 number of industrial jobs total turnover from industry and number of industrial companies in each gb region in general the number of companies and the amount of turnover is linked although some regions perform better than others the northern regions of england except the north east are much more industrialised than the southern regions the south east is the only southern region that is above the national average on all three metrics wales and scotland are both below the national averages although there is a high number of jobs in scotland compared to the number of companies and turnover therefore changes in industry such as automation or continued changes to industrial composition to reduce emissions would affect the northern regions of england most strongly fluctuations in energy prices for industry could also strongly influence the economies of these regions significant fluctuations may become more common as the energy system continues in its transformation figure 57 additional cost of fully electrifying industrial processes 53 implications of a transitioning industrial sector 531 changes in energy cost from increased electrification of industry there are some processes that could theoretically be electrified such as space heating or drying the potential cost to industry if fuel consumption for certain enduse applications were moved from fossilbased fuels to electricity is presented in figure 57 this assumes that 1 kwh of electricity can provide the same thermal service as 1 kwh of coal natural gas or oil further it uses 2018 fuel prices7 to estimate the additional cost of completely electrifying certain enduse applications in industry the values reflect what the total cost to british industry would be for the industries that collect enduse energy consumption data this therefore does not reflect a complete cost to industry but does offer an indication any additional capital costs of changing systems to electricity were excluded so the analysis only includes the additional running costs of the enduse application this analysis also ignores potential system interplays whereby certain processes may provide inputs to other process eg through steam production therefore electrifying one enduse application may require greater fuel consumption downstream as the residual energy may no longer be present the results are shown in figure 57 transforming industrial process could significantly increase energy costs for industry support through carbon pricing revenues for example could help to reduce these additional costs the processes for electrification are ranked in order of assumed ease of electrification with space heating being the easiest and lowtemperature processes being the most difficult of the processes considered in figure 57 if space heating dryingseparation low temperature processes and other enduse applications in industry are electrified the annual energy cost approximately doubles compared to current costs this is linked to low fossil fuel costs compared to higher electricity costs however if carbon prices are to increase this could reduce the additional running costs of an electrified system if the revenue is used to offset the electricity costs 532 automation the trend of automation in industry is a highly debated topic increased automation will have varying regional impacts depending on the relative dependence on high risk industries for example pwc suggests that up to 46 of manufacturing jobs are at high risk being automated as are 23 of jobs in mining and quarrying and 63 in waste and water figure 58 shows the number of industrial jobs in these sectors at risk from automation by region automation could aid decarbonisation but may cost hundreds of thousands of jobs the midlands and northern regions are most at risk the north west south east and midlands are at the greatest risk of losing jobs to automation due to the prevalence of manufacturing water and waste management london the north east and wales are the least industrialised regions and therefore the potential for automation removing industrial jobs will have less of an impact on these regions outside of the socioeconomic implications an increase in industrial automation could result in increased overall energy consumption as energy is substituted for labour however automation is largely linked to electrification so the carbon intensity of the power sector will determine the ghg emissions from these automated processes whether this increases or decreases direct emissions from industry depends on what the process emissions were before automation chapter 6 regional implications the regional barometers in each section of this report have shown the status of britains regions in transforming and futureproofing their energy systems these results have been summarised for each region in figure 61 the same methodology is used for the regions as is used for each sector counting the number of metrics which are pushing ahead within 90 of the target or not on track the following sections summarise the progress and impacts of transforming each regions energy system figure 61 overall indicator for how transformed the energy system is in britains regions the sections below are ordered based on the ranking of how well each region is progressing the data required to build a regional indication of the industrial sector was not available thus industry is excluded from this chapter this does not mean there are not specific regional impacts that come from transforming the energy supplied to britains industry for example the vehicle manufacturing in the west midlands or the energy intensive industry in tees valley in sections 3 and 4 this report calculates the total cost of ownership of modern electric vehicle and heating technologies and the gap between them and their conventional counterparts figure 62 combines these to give the total additional cost a household in each region could expect to face for electrifying their heating and upgrading to an electric vehicle figure 62 the annual additional cost of electrifying heat and transport in each region measured as the total cost of ownership tco gap between electric and conventional technologies for heating the cost is based on conversion from gas boilers where possible and from oil boilers in homes off the gas grid for vehicles the cost is based on conversion from the regional share of petrol and diesel vehicles london stands apart from other regions because the unique characteristics of its transport networks the congestion charge and people driving fewer miles per year mean the lifetime cost of owning an electric vehicle is on par with petrol already in all other regions there is still an appreciable cost barrier to uptake of electric vehicles outside of london there is a 30 spread in the cost gap which ranges from an extra 840 per year in the west midlands up to 1100 per year in wales the regions which face smaller additional costs from electrification are generally those in the top half of the progress league table figure 61 and those with the highest costs are generally falling behind this shows that the individual regional characteristics especially socioeconomic factors are critical to the fair and equitable transformation of britains energy system 61 london london has progressed the most of all britains regions in terms of energy transition a strong driver in the region is the electrification of transport londons power system is characterised by having no large generators the urbanised nature allows for solar photovoltaics although uptake is low at present as london does not expect growth in generation capacity the power grid does not need to be expanded at regional borders but reinforcement may well be necessary on lower voltage levels within the region to account for electric vehicles overall the region is driven and characterised by its energy consumption and not generation london has relatively high epc ratings although not as high as scotland and the east and has the lowest levels of f and g ratings london is midrange in terms of fuel poverty but high when compared to surrounding regions this is most likely due to the demographic and socioeconomic structure of the southern regions the housing structure has a higher electric heating rate than the rest of the country due to the high proportion of electric heating for offgas grid homes despite this there are very few lowcarbon heating installations in london with the transport sector london shows the greatest decrease in absolute and relative emissions this is likely related to efficiency gains in public transport increases in active travel and decreases in road kilometres driven in london where public transport walking and cycling make up a greater share of the modal split the emissions per person from transport is about 1 tonne of co 2 e per year in every other region commuting by private car dominates and so residents emit 15 to 25 times that of londoners london has the highest number of electric charging points hydrogen refuelling stations are even more strongly clustered within london fewer than half of the stations are outside the capital the region has the greatest number of ultralow emission buses as tfls commitment to electric and hybrid buses has led to rapid uptake air quality issues are one of the main drivers of this development london has seen the greatest increase in the number of electrichydrogen buses with an over 15fold increase between 2013 and 2018 overall london has the lowest emissions from diesel usage in rail due to higher rail electrification in the area london as the only purelyurban region has by far the greatest number of bus stops per square kilometre allowing for a modal share that is not dominated by private cars this allows london to transition faster and more effectively which will reduce travel costs in future the average distance driven by each vehicle is substantially lower in london than any other region thus giving london the lowest total cost of ownership londons congestion charge  an additional tax  is not applicable to plugin and hybrid vehicles giving a substantial incentive for electric vehicles tfl report that an average vehicle makes 8 trips vehicle per year into the congestion charge zone assumed in this study however if a vehicle were to travel every working day into the zone this could increase the cost of petrol and diesel cars by up to 3000 per year which would further improve the total cost of ownership for plugin vehicles in comparison london is the only region in britain where total cost of ownership for batteryelectric vehicles is lower than petrol or diesel london has a low ratio of number of evs per available charging point linked to having a higher proportion of ev chargers andor a smaller absolute number of evs it is clear that railway spend was focused on london receiving almost 45 of the combined funds from national government local authorities and private organisations further almost a third of central government railway spend went to london which alone is greater than the spending from all sources in any of the other regions interestingly spending correlates to the share of electrified network within the regions putting london south east north west and scotland at the top the additional cost of using a heat pump and electric vehicle amounts to 60 per year in london this is mainly driven by the additional cost of in electric heating as opposed to other regions where the cost increase in driven mostly by the increased bev costs london is on the cusp of having modern electric technologies reach cost parity with incumbent fossil fuels the additional costs in london are substantially lower than in any other region 62 scotland the scottish energy system really stands out from the other regions it is leading in several areas and acts as an example for the energy transition to come in other regions scotland has fully met half of the targets laid out in this report joint first with london scotland has the highest installed power station capacity as well as the highest share of renewables of all regions onshore wind power dominates the generation mix as this region offers an exceptionally good wind resource and low population density the large increase in wind power generation has offset the phaseout of coal and gas and the future closure of nuclear power the wind industry enables scotland to generate new employment and create an alternative for the oil and gas industry scotland has the largest number of jobs in renewables of all regions with the potential to continue growing as the transition continues however more recently political uncertainties about the future of onshore wind have arisen which may stop economic development in that area simultaneously there is considerable uncertainty for potential future nuclear power plants as these would increase the grid congestion already prevalent in scotland the siting of wind turbines at the best wind resource locations does not coincide with preexisting location of the grid which was built out many decades ago and not designed to cope with large amounts of wind power locally congested electricity from wind power can lead to opportunities for local smart energy solutions and sector coupling of the electricity transport and industrial sector on the buildings side scotland has a relatively energyefficient building stock with the highest proportion of epc ratings above c at the same time a relatively high proportion of households live in fuel poverty 118 using the english low income high cost lihc method one reason for that might be due to scotland having the highest proportion of electric heat 122 with highlands reaching 2025 this corresponds to similar proportions of offgas grid properties in these areas 55 of scotlands offgas grid homes are electric the highest proportion in britain the average energy spend is secondlargest in scotland largest in south east with some areas spending 600 more per year when compared to british average the average scot is spending approximately 3 of disposable income on energy this situation has been identified and led to the largest deployment of efficient and lowcarbon heating 052 or 12300 units this aims to address both climate change and fuel poverty issues by increasing efficiency which makes scots likely to be better off in the future however this strongly depends on the technology the fuel poor homes are changing from and the energy efficiency of the homes the economic decision to not build a gas grid has affected consumers negatively and raises questions on possible future decarbonisation using hydrogen if heating was changed through the installation of airsourced heat pumps in the ongas grid homes and offgas grid homes that are not already electric or biomass change in energy spend would decrease by 33 in scotland or 35 by 2030 this is a very small change in proportion of average household income in the transport sector scotland has the second highest number of electric charging points only london has more electric vehicle charging points london scotland and the south east have more than half of britains charging points between them at the same time scotland has a low ratio of evs per available charging point linked to having a higher proportion of ev chargers andor a smaller absolute number of evs this means scotlands infrastructure is ready for greater ev uptake scotland is also second to london in the number of electrichydrogen buses with an almost 6fold increase between 2013 and 2018 and amongst the leaders in the proportion of heavy good vehicles hgvs that are already electrified or using hydrogen regardless of vehicle type the total cost of ownership is highest in scotland and wales while it is the lowest in london this may be affecting the ev uptake in the region regionally for batteryelectric vehicles and plugin hybrid electric vehicles wales scotland and the north east face the greatest financial burden when owning a vehicle the additional cost of using a heat pump and electric vehicle equates to 990 per year in scotland this is driven solely by the additional cost of bevs compared to fossil fuelled vehicles as we project a small saving from switching to ashp in scotland related to the high off gas grid housing stock compared to other regions scotland has the 5th highest additional costs 63 east of england the east of england is the third most transformed region in britain a fivefold increase in grid capacity is needed for transporting electricity from offshore wind farms to load centres inland the building of offshore wind farms will contribute significantly to the regions economy whilst at the same time reducing the overall transmission length by being close to london the subsequent increase in employment will have a significant impact on the local economy with building of supply chains around the industry the epc ratings are second highest in this part of the country the same goes for residential fuel poverty rates the southern regions effect means that electric heating rates are higher than on average all of these factors mean that the region has an advantageous starting point for the energy transition regionally the west midlands and the east of england are leading the ev uptake at the same time the charging point density is low for the number of vehicles on the road a consequence of the successful ev rollout the current situation indicates that innovation around smart charging could happen here especially when evs are combined with the future of offshore wind power for balancing services this could lead to significant cost saving for this region the additional cost of having an ashp and owning a bev is equivalent to 970 per year in the east of england as with most regions this cost is mostly related to the additional cost of bevs compared to fossil fuelled ones with ashp accounting for less than 50 of the total additional costs as compared to other regions the east has the 6th highest additional costs 64 south west the south west is ranked joint fourth when compared to the rest of britain however this part of the country faces particular challenges the south west is characterised by its weak electrical connection and remoteness relatively speaking grid congestion is already present and hinders the further installation of solar photovoltaics the reductions in feedtariffs for solar pv has affected the region negatively it is to be expected that this region will be one of the first to restart the solar boom once the technology can support itself subsidy free  due to its relatively good solar resource compared to the rest of the country the buildings have a relatively high rate of epc ratings of c and above but also a substantial share f and g rated buildings 74 it sees higher fuel poverty than other southern regions although still midrange this is certainly due to having the highest electric heating rate outside of scotland and the highest number of offgas grid properties and the second most lowcarbon heating installations whilst the south west has a relatively large number of ev charging points there has been a small uptake of evs compared to the other southern regions this has resulted in a relatively high proportion of chargers relative to evs the gap in total cost of ownership for evs in the south west is similar to that of the other southern regions but its lower average household income could be stopping the deployment of these vehicles for other lowcarbon transport like buses and hgvs the south west is lagging behind its targets the south west is among the regions with the lowest additional costs 3rd lowest associated with electrification of heating and transport this amounts to 845 per year which is entirely from the additional cost of bev ownership in fact as with scotland there is a benefit to switching heating to ashp which is again related to the high off gas grid household stock 65 south east the south east of england is ranked joint fourth the region has faced grid congestion in the past and the installation of almost 2 gw of photovoltaics has exacerbated the situation in response the region has seen the largest storage capacity for new storage ie not pumpedhydro the storage is used for grid balancing and innovative approaches to load flow management by the local distribution network to alleviate grid congestion this will benefit consumers as their bills will be lower than what they could have been without these measures the south east has the lowest epc ratings of the southern regions but it is still relatively high when to compared to the national average fuel poverty is lowest in the country despite having more houses off the gas grid the highest energy bills per household in britain this is mainly due to socioeconomic factors and milder winters this should enable consumers and businesses alike to invest in new technologies and exploit the gains in the future the south east is amongst the regions with the highest number of ev charging points it has high car ownership and private transport is the main mode of commuting therefore there is potential to see large emission decreases through a modal shift or continued electrification of private transport the region leads on the proportion and absolute numbers of hgvs that are already electrified or use hydrogen the emissions due to diesel usage in rail are highest in the south east despite high electrification of rail and lowest spend per passenger journey it is suspected that the large volume of journeys are the cause of this the south east has projected additional cost of electrifying heating and transport of 940 per year the 4th lowest among britains regions as with other regions this is mostly related to the additional cost of bev ownership which accounts for 860 of the additional yearly cost 66 west midlands the west midlands ranks as the sixth most transformed region placing it in the middle of britains league table the power sector in this region is changing most drastically of all regions it has become a large importer of electricity in recent years due to the retirement of conventional generation and very little uptake of renewable capacity this means that the region is decoupled from the economic activity of the energy sector in britain and has no value creation and jobs from electricity generation in future this will make the region worse off in terms of electricity generation than it was just a few years ago the region is midrange for most buildings metrics for example in epc ratings but had the highest fuel poverty rates between 2012 and 2016 despite low electric heating rates the combination of imported electricity and high fuel poverty rates means that there may be a challenge in the future on the upside the west midlands is leading with ev penetration at 052 of the car fleet this growth is likely to be linked to the automotive industry that is present in the region and the fact that the total cost of ownership is the lowest in this region when compared to the rest of the britain except for london the uptake of electric vehicles has also led to a higher ev to charging point ratio suggesting greater competition for charging in the future in fact the regions performance on electric vehicles secures its position in the midrange the west midlands has the 2nd lowest additional cost associated with heating and transport electrification behind london the total yearly cost of 840 is primarily due to bev ownership 760 while the additional yearly cost of ashp heating amounts to 85 67 wales the welsh power system can be characterised by its large pumpedhydro storage capacity and a number of gasfired power stations in the south wales has by far the highest rate of smart meter rollout of all regions this will enable consumers in wales to become one of the first regions to profit from the potential benefits such as demand response activities however this may be offset by the low income in the region which makes it less likely that the necessary investment such as electric vehicles and heat pumps is undertaken on a large scale unless specific support schemes are provided this means wales may miss out on the benefits of its smart meter rollout in the future whilst it has to burden the cost of rolling out millions of meters the welsh housing stock is among the least efficient in britain it has one of the lowest regional proportions of epc ratings above c and with 9 of epc ratings in the f and g category this means that electrification of heating could increase overall energy costs this would negatively affect the region economically and could increase fuel poverty where it currently holds a midrange position wales has the lowest ev penetration and the fewest charging points with only 3 of all the chargers being in wales this is induced by the more rural setting than other regions and higher driving distances the region will miss out on the benefits of electric vehicles and could pay a higher price for electrification wales has a single electric bus running in cardiff which exemplifies the current situation wales has the lowest joint with east midlands number of ultralow emission hgvs and faces the greatest financial burden for batteryelectric vehicles and plugin hybrid electric vehicles when normalised by the total number of journeys taken in that same year wales is amongst the highest investment spend per journey on rail and much higher than the south east of england ie regions east south east and london this seems to correlate with the limited electrification in rail and reduces the chances of carbon emissions reduction through a modal shift in the transport sector wales suffers the highest cost associated with transitioning to electric heating and passenger transport the yearly additional cost amounts to 1100 with 1040 related to the increased cost bevs and 60 related to the increased cost of ashp 68 east midlands the east midlands is ranked joint eighth in the regional comparison the power system continues to host a large coal and gas capacity as well as a significant renewable and electricity storage capacity currently the region has the second highest transmission capacity of all regions however a smaller growth rate compared to other regions further north could see the east midlands lose this secondplace ranking the growth in renewables and existing transmission capacity places the region at a good starting point to undergo an electricity transformation the east midlands has the second greatest absolute number and the greatest penetration of ultralow emission buses into their fleet in the east midlands the city of nottingham has been an early adopter of electric buses having recently purchased a further 13 battery electric buses to join the current 45 the east midlands have the lowest number of ultralow emission hgvs despite positive movement in the transport sector there is still considerable changes required to ensure a transformation of the transport sector the east midlands have one of the highest proportions of f and g rated buildings resulting in part in high fuel poverty rates electric heating uptake is low in buildings considerable support is required to ensure that both the energy transformation in buildings can occur alongside other regions and that vulnerable consumers will not be significantly financially affected the additional yearly cost of using ashp for heating and a bev for private passenger transport amounts to over 1000 in the east midlands this is mostly related to the 920 additional cost of bev ownership the east midlands therefore ranks as the region with the 4th highest additional cost humber bridge 69 yorkshire and the humber ranking join eighth yorkshire and the humber is characterised by its past of being home to several large coal power plants remaining one of the few regions with active coal power generation and currently has the secondmost installed capacity further as a result of draxs conversion of four out of six coal units to biomass yorkshire and the humber has the greatest biomass capacity in britain projections indicate the region will connect several offshore wind farms generating employment during the construction and operation phases this added capacity in the region will mean either greater electricity storage will be required or a doubling of the grid capacity in neighbouring regions notably the region currently has one of the lowest installed capacities in electricity storage although recent announcements suggest yorkshire may become a leader in this area yorkshire has seen the greatest growth of all regions in the number of plugin vehicles having grown over 200 times its size since 2011 albeit from a low starting point the region requires more incentives for progress in the energy transition of the transport sector as it would otherwise fall behind the rest of the country buildings in yorkshire have the lowest rate of epc ratings above c in the country with around 7 of buildings rated at f and g despite having the second lowest energy bills in britain fuel poverty is still high strong intervention is required to ensure that the regions energy transition in buildings is not left behind the additional cost of electric heating and transport is 950 in yorkshire of this 880 is related to the additional cost of bev ownership this places yorkshire slightly below average ranking the 5th lowest cost among the regions 610 north west the north west ranks tenth its power system has a rich mix of coal gas and nuclear power stations as well as offshore wind power in the irish sea further the largest wind turbine of the world resides in the newly finished burbo bank offshore wind farm which connects to an onshore substation at wallasey near liverpool the north west was also the first region to have liquid air electricity storage before the facility was moved from lancashire to birmingham the region has one of the highest employment numbers in renewable energy in england increasing its longterm competitiveness despite these progresses in the power sector the region does not rank highly amongst the other regions in the energy transition of the power sector the north west is one of the leading regions for the penetration of ultralow emission hgvs both in absolute number and as a proportion of the hgv fleet this however does not overcome the shortcomings in the other transport transition metrics the region requires greater support to ensure that it is not left behind in the energy transition of the transport sector buildings in the north west are characterised by lowmidrange epc ratings despite lower electricity prices the cost of heating still leaves many north westerners fuel poor due to overall lower regional incomes this is generally reflected in all the midlands and northern regions the transition to electric heating would increase energy bills in the regions strongly affecting already vulnerable fuel poor consumers the additional cost of electrifying heating and transportation amounts to 1020 per year in the north west this is mostly related to the additional cost of bev ownership which stand at 910 per year the north west has the 2nd highest additional cost behind only wales 611 north east the north east is the least transformed region in gb the north easts power system is characterised by its need to triple grid transmission capacity by 2040 with the possibility of connecting an offshore wind farms in the near future the largest power stations are hartlepool nuclear power plant 13 gw set for decommissioning in the mid2020s and lynemouth biomass power station 400 mw excluding biomass the north east has the lowest power station capacity in the country except london this absence of generation especially by the mid2020s means that an investment in wind power could boost local economy and enhance the current the structural changes ongoing in the region positively the region has the second highest smart meter rollout rate in britain the north east has had the smallest growth in the number of registered plugin vehicles with its fleet in 2018 q1 being 34 times larger than it was in 2011 which is only half the national growth rate to compound this the north east has fewer electric and hydrogen buses than it did in 2010 based on total cost of ownership calculations batteryelectric vehicles and plugin hybrid electric vehicles place the greatest financial burden on consumer of the north east interestingly the competition for charging points is amongst the lowest in britain meaning the stage is set for greater uptake of electric vehicles based on the total number of journeys the north east invested the most per rail journey in 2017 despite its limited electrification the regions buildings have a relatively high epc ratings above c however it has the second highest fuel poverty rates despite having some of the lowest energy bills there are currently very few lowcarbon heating units installed and our total cost of ownership calculations show that a change to electric heating would increase household bills in the north east the most compared to other regions the cost of switching to electric heating and transport in the north east is projected to be 1015 per year this is the 3rd highest cost increase across britains regions and only 2year behind the north west bev ownership accounts for 890 of this additional cost while ashp heating accounts for 125 clearly efforts to reduce the cost premium for electric technologies in a region with belowaverage uptake and belowaverage income could have significant impacts on future progress chapter 7 conclusions this study has examined the current state of the energy transition and its likely future pathway by combining publicly available data and commonly accepted scenarios for the energy transition we have identified targets for the future state of the energy system and the current state of the transition as the energy transition cannot be measured directly we have chosen to use a large number of indicators to establish whether the transition is on track these metrics serve as a proxy to gauge the process for each metric we identify whether it is on track almost on track 90 of target or not on track the progress is then measured towards scenarios from national grid future energy scenarios fes the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis and the governments committee on climate change ccc which have the target year of 2030 these findings are standardised in a barometer format giving the visual representation of the progress additional data was gathered to present the barometers on a regional level for the 11 regions of great britain this represents an important differentiation of the information when compared to previously published reports the regional information adds another layer of analysis and allows the investigation of the regional differences regions differ in their starting points in the energy transition as well as in their potential to transition the power transport heating and industrial energy sectors and how they interact sector coupling we further combine this data with socioeconomic information on each region which allows us to analyse the implications for individuals and businesses the results from the barometers show that the power sector largely on track and in full state of transition further challenges lie ahead to achieve the deep decarbonisation that is required the buildings energy sector poses a big challenge and requires significantly more effort to decarbonise we have assessed the progress of decarbonising heating with electrification and increasing energy efficiency in homes concluding that the current levels of activity will not yield the necessary results the transport sector has a more diverse picture some of the chosen indicators show that the transport sector is on track eg number of ev chargers in some regions however regional differences are most pronounced in the transport energy sector the industrial sector is potentially the hardest to decarbonise as it is diverse in the application with the most energyintensive processes unable to transform because of either economic or technical reasons however economic growth in industry has already decoupled from ghg emissions which is an encouraging sign for the future 71 power the sector is on track to meet three out of six of its objectives and in close pursuit of two more with one target clearly missed so far in the future all electricity will have to come from clean sources such as wind solar and nuclear alongside the use of flexible options for balancing eg bioenergy and gas with ccus the large cost reduction in renewable energies sources res makes it more likely that intermittent generators will dominate the energy system a shift in the location of generators will change and therefore so will the areas of economic activity in the electricity supply sector generally speaking this favours more rural and coastal areas a multitude of different options such as interconnection storage and demand side response will be available in the future to allow the balancing of the system the rollout of smart meters is taking place at a different speeds across the country but is clearly behind the target this prohibits the use of demand response from domestic customers in the near future large cost reductions in key technologies such as renewable generators batteries and hydrogen suggest that it is possible that costs for the consumers may not rise at all renewables particularly wind and solar farms have led to job creation in less economically developed regions britain scotland shows that the increase in renewable generation has created a strong new industrial sector the changing generation mix is leading to shifting employment patterns with job losses in fossil generation businesses offset by gains in employment in renewables the dispersed nature of renewables means that jobs are created in construction operation and maintenance in more remote areas 72 transport the sector is on track to achieve three out of the seven targets examined for this research and falling well behind on four transport is behind in reaching its ghg emissions target and a long way off the final target meaning that large changes will be required to achieve the 2030 climate targets electric vehicle ev sales are ramping up from a low base but the current 04 of the fleet will need to become 27 by 2030 if climate targets are to be met at an aggregated national level ev charger deployment appears to be on target to deliver enough charging points for the projected ev uptake however there is regional and intraregional clustering of these charging points which will result in shortages and access problems in other locations the electricity network implications of charging infrastructure also require significant investment hydrogen vehicles have not yet developed in britain with only one vehicle model currently eligible for the plugin grant the lack of refuelling stations and their clustering in london further hinders deployment early battery and hydrogen electric bus fleet penetration is on track despite overall bus fleet growth rail emissions have only decreased by 1 since 2010 jeopardising the achievability of the 2030 target recently scrapped electrification plans are further hampering the transition of this industry 73 buildings domestic buildings are a high emitting sector mainly due to the provision of heat 83 of energy used domestically goes to space and water heating economically and environmentally this is the area to focus upon domestic energy efficiency in britain is lagging behind targets and nondomestic energy efficiency targets do not exist scotland benefits from higher proportions of high energy efficiency ratings whilst wales has the poorest performing houses on average this can have a large effect on energy bills especially with electric heating which can have significantly higher costs than oil or gas low energy efficiency is also linked to fuel poverty however this correlation is hard to see with the averaged out regional data fuel poverty has been fairly even across the britain but is generally more prevalent in northern regions than southern ones matching the trends in household income despite large deployment targets for 2030 the share of lowcarbon heating especially heat pumps is still very low a large scale up in the near future is therefore necessary this will affect the cost of energy for each region differently depending on the housing composition and current heating source extreme electrification could benefit energy spend in scotland and the southwest while increasing costs for midland and northern regions of england there are already high levels of electrification in nondomestic buildings the south of england is the most electrified part of gb in this subsector london and the south spend less on energy relative to gross value added gva making companies in these regions less susceptible to changes in the energy system and its costs 74 industry industry is a difficult sector to transform as there are many economic and technological barriers and there are no robust targets for the industrial sectors energy transition beyond ghg reduction as a whole british industry has decoupled its economic growth from the emission of ghgs currently placing it on track to reach climate targets absolute electricity use in industry has stayed constant while its share of total energy has increased as processes have been electrified and efficiency increases have been implemented the top 10 energy consuming industries have varying degrees of electrification at this point many processes have been optimised for cost it is theoretically possible to increase electrification but this will increase energy costs significantly this would make industry uncompetitive unless carbon pricing revenue is recouped north west midlands and south east are most at risk to losing jobs because of automation as these are the most industrialised areas in the country over 500000 jobs are at risk in manufacturing mining and quarrying water and waste this would obviously have a large effect on the energy demand of the industrial sector 75 concluding remarks so in this first assessment of britains energy transition there is much to be positive about but science fiction writer william gibsons observation that the future is already here  its just not very evenly distributed applies the rapid decarbonisation of electricity is a feather in britains cap providing a means to transform electricityintensive sectors buildings and to some extent industry are already benefiting whilst transport is potentially wellpositioned there are tough challenges ahead though since areas such as heavy industry freight transport and some parts of heating do not immediately lend themselves to electrification so other options need to be considered the uneven distribution of change also applies regionally and socially a looming concern is the effect of disparities in the energy transition with some at risk of being left behind economically due to unaffordable changes as in other walks of life london stands apart whilst less affluent regions in the north and elsewhere are falling behind on many measures this work has drawn from diverse sources to provide a synthesised picture full comparability of data is hard but the authors have sought to adjust for differences of scope timescale and accuracy care has been taken to consider where britain ought to be relative to the desired end points many representations of the underlying data are possible and more has been left out than included more can always be done and the authors welcome the
