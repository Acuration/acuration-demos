uk government response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme which will enable drax to convert a fourth unit to biomass the response proposes that rather than imposing a cap on roc 1 support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all roc 1 units this would protect existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the governments support for further sustainable biomass generation at drax which will allow us to accelerate the removal of coal from the electricity system replacing it with flexible low carbon renewable electricity we look forward to implementing a costeffective solution for our fourth biomass unit at drax enquiries investor relations mark

power station  energy policy  investors  wood pellets refurbishing a 300tonne generator core within the heart of a power station 6 december 2017 power generation at the centre of drax power station in a corner of the cavernous turbine hall is a white box the inside of this box is spotlessly clean not only are its white walls free of dirt they are free of even dust but there is one outlier inside this sterile environment a 300tonne chunk of industrial equipment this equipment is a generator core  the central component for converting the mechanical energy to electrical power the core is driven by the steam turbine ninety tonnes of generator rotor spinning at 3000 rpm with just millimetres of clearance from the core produce 660 megawatts mw of electricity thats enough  645 mw when exported from drax into the national grid  to power a city the size of sheffield the generator is a serious piece of industrial machinery and despite the pristine conditions this white box is the site of serious engineering a process normally done by largescale manufacturers in dedicated factories rewinding a generator core  as the process is called  is a major operation no other uk facility is capable of doing this complex job so its here in a white box in the middle of an operational power station in north yorkshire that a team of engineers is undertaking work that will secure the generators use for decades this is the drax rewinding facility how a generator works a generator consists of two main components a spinning rotor and a stationary stator the rotor which is directly connected to the main turbine and spins 50 times every second sits inside the stator both the stator and the rotor contain a large number of copper coils known as windings these windings are what carry the electrical current the rotor acts like a very strong electromagnet which when a voltage is applied produces a strong magnetic field because the rotor sits inside the stator this magnetic field intersects the copper windings of the stator and induces a voltage in these windings allowing current to flow this voltage is then brought out of the stator and passed through a stepup transformer where it is increased to a level suitable for transmission through the national grid the stator core is made from many elements with hundreds of thousands of laminations 84 watercooled insulated copper bars each 11 metres long and weighing 200kg forming the windings various insulating materials blocks packing wedges and condition monitoring equipment generator stators can operate for decades without fault diy at drax in 2016 a team of engineers at drax embarked on a project to construct a facility to rewind the stator on site this required crosscompany collaborative working to design and construct this huge purpose built facility contamination can cause operational problems so the team built a sterile white room within the turbine hall  one of just two places within the power station with foundations strong enough to support the incredible 450 tonnes required for the rewind facility designed to hold the stator core and the conductor bars air is forced out of the room to limit the possibility of contamination to the core during the rewind when the unit is in service it becomes magnetic so any metallic particles left in the space will be attracted to the core explains drax electrical engineer thomas walker once magnetised any metal particles could be drawn in burrowing into the insulation and core lamination this is the kind of event that an electricity generator wants to avoid  but when it happens be prepared to fix it roll with it when draxs stators were manufactured in the 1980s completing their construction relied on manual handling techniques modern day facilities however rotate the core to minimise human contact it took just six months for a partnership involving drax siemens and enser to manufacture what could be the largest stator rollers in the world and within that time ship them from the us to north yorkshire with the rollers installed the next step was to move in the core two of the turbine halls cranes each capable of lifting 150 tonnes were combined to lift it hoisting the core onto the mechanical roller within the rewind facility once in place the roller rotates the core allowing for the copper conductor bars to be safely removed and inserted despite this mechanical help the removing and replacing of each one is still at its heart a human job we still need 10 men to physically move the conductor bars with lifting aids which makes it not an easy process says walker using this method the bars weighing 200kg each can be safely and precisely fitted into the core opting for inhouse rewinding a stator is a complex process however when the time logistics and costs of shipping the core to siemens  the germanbased manufacturers  was factored in the decision to do the work at drax power station was an easy one  a 300tonne core is not easy to transport and the highways agency do not like things like that on the roads theyd want us to use waterways says drax lead engineer mark rowbottom logistically it just wasnt worth it its too much money to move and ship that weight to germany so we looked at what we could do onsite more than just an economical and logistical decision and with the uks diminishing manufacturing facilities drax is now equipped to support generator rewinds for many years to come building and operating the rewind facility was a project that leveraged the engineering abilities of drax employees they are increasingly doing engineering traditionally outsourced to equipment manufacturers the experience we have gained and the close working relationship we have established with siemens enables us to support the generator for the remaining life of the station says rowbottom to see the core in that many pieces and stripped down to this level is very rare says walker who began working at the plant as an apprentice  of the 84 conductor bars half have been fitted and the team is scheduled to complete the stator rewind in early 2018 i never thought id do anything like this but am proud to say that ive done it tags drax power station  engineering  investors  technology 7 things to see at drax power station 4 october 2017 power generation chimneys taller than the london eye domes bigger than the albert hall and enough steel tubing to run the length of the uk twice drax power station is a structure of superlatives but its visiting the site that truly drives home the scale of the electricity generating process from tiny biomass pellets to landscapeshaping cooling towers here are seven of the mostimpressive and interesting parts of drax power station cooling towers arguably the power stations most recognisable landmarks draxs 12 giant cooling towers each measure 114 metres tall to put that in perspective each is large enough to fit the entire statue of liberty inside it  with room to spare these massive concrete structures cool the water used as part of the generation process water is pumped into the tower at roughly 40 degrees celsius and is cooled by air naturally pulled into the structure by its unique shape once the water is cooled it is safely returned to the river ouse so whats coming out the top of a cooling tower water vapour and it only accounts for roughly 2 of all the water pumped into the tower biomass domes standing 65 metres tall draxs four biomass domes are each larger than the royal albert hall and between them hold approximately 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days each dome was constructed by inflating a massive pvc dome  coating its inside with a layer of polyurethane foam and then adding steel and concrete reinforcements because of the sensitive nature of compressed wood pellets the environment inside each dome must be very carefully monitored one of the measures to keep the biomass inert is to feed in nitrogen extracted from the air into the dome  rail unloading bay coals days traversing the uk by train are almost numbered  biomass is taking over its routes compressed wood pellets arrive to english shores at the ports of liverpool  hull and immingham and are then transported across the country in specially designed trains roughly 14 arrive every day collectively unloading about 20000 tonnes of pellets draxs bespoke wagons ensure the wood pellets are kept dry during transportation and unloaded as efficiently as possible this includes a hatch on the bottom of the wagons that is opened magnetically to drop the pellets down into the collection area as they arrive turbine hall heres where the magic happens  its in the turbine hall that electricity is generated biomass is fast replacing coal to be combusted to produce steam which is used to spin massive electromagnets at 3000 rpm inside copper windings which in turn generates electricity with each of the six turbines capable of exporting over 600 megawatts mw into the national grid  the total capacity of drax power station sits just shy of 4000 mw 70 of which now comes from sustainable biomass  an impressive 17 of great britains renewable electricity from this one epic site control room the nerve centre of the power station data

generation  engineering  power station  turbines batteries as big as biomass domes 24 may 2017 sustainable bioenergy renewables are playing a bigger part of our electricity mix as the uk moves towards a low carbon economy how we plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables is among the greatest challenges faced by the energy sector sources like wind and solar are intermittent  they cant generate electricity all the time when the sun doesnt shine or the wind doesnt blow they lack the fuel needed to generate power and cant feed into the grid this leaves a gap in the uks electricity supply that needs to be filled today thats done by sources like coal gas and biomass which can be dialled up and down to accommodate for the dips and peaks in generation created by changes in demand and the weather one alternative being touted as a possible solution is storage and in particular battery technology however creating batteries on a scale big enough to meet our incredible demand is a considerable challenge its a challenge that will be met in a future where giant affordable batteries are able to store solar power captured in the summer months for use in the winter but costs would have to come down at an even faster rate than they have done in recent years the challenge of building bigger batteries to demonstrate the size of this challenge consider the biomass storage domes at drax power station these effectively operate as giant energy stores with the flexible ability to quickly feed renewable fuel to the power station which generates electricity on demand our biomass domes can hold 300000 tonnes of sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets  the equivalent of 600 gwh worth of electricity currently batteries cost 350 per kwh meaning at present prices it would cost 210 billion to replace the capacity of all four of our biomass domes using battery power even if battery technology advances dramatically over the next few years that figure is only likely to fall to around 60 billion then there is the question of the ancillary services that thermal power stations provide the batteries of the future may be able to provide these vital services such as synthetic inertia shortterm reserve and reactive power but for now providing these via battery power is prohibitively expensive and in some cases best left to biomass and gas power stations we should not underestimate the challenges ahead the uks everchanging power system will need to balance more electricity generated via wind and solar with affordable solutions that are also reliable flexible and lower carbon than coal  this is why drax is developing four rapidresponse gas power stations in addition to continuing its investment in biomass generation and supply tags drax power station  energy storage  investors inside the machine shop 24 april 2017 power generation a klaxon sounds and a crane big enough to lift 160 tonnes moves slowly across the inside of a cavernous warehouse below a team of engineers stand around a turbine spindle the size of a double decker bus but weighing four times as much at 65 tonnes waiting for the cranes descent around them other engineers work on similarsized equipment one uses a wrench the size of an arm another programs a computerised lever to carefully strip millimetres from a piece of steel its just a normal day inside drax power station s machine workshop for the last 15 years this workshop has been refurbishing repairing and manufacturing tools and equipment for use at the power station  a fact that sets drax apart from other stations like it were envied by a few stations because we do most things inhouse says turbine engineer and head of the workshop andrew storr were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people storr set up the workshop in 2001 after being asked to reverse engineer a replacement set of governor relays components that help regulate the flow of steam going into the turbines for one of draxs steam turbines today its a thriving centre of activity filled with heavyduty machinery and ingenious engineers a look inside the workshop when youre manufacturing spares its not a matter of going down to our machine shop and just saying make one of those youve got to have the correct grade of material the correct size the correct certification for the material  you cant just have a scrappy piece of steel that you find its got to have paperwork with it to say its certified up to whatever its supposed to be says storr turbine bearings need to be bored to size using a horizontal borer that very accurately shaves out the lining of the inner bearing getting it right is incredibly important explains storr if its made too large it causes the turbine shaft to vibrate if its made too small the bearing becomes too hot and the white metal will melt and pour out the bearing we need to avoid both of these issues at all cost the inside of the turbine blading needs to have seal strips administered by hand as theyre delicately made to limit any damage to the spinning shaft should they touch each other despite the wealth of equipment at the disposal of the team in the shop success depends on the skill of the engineers using it there are three 160tonne cranes in the turbine hall each installed before the turbines were built this meant the construction companies who erected the turbines could lift all heavy components into place with ease due to their size they move slowly it takes approximately 20 minutes for the largest hook to travel from the ground all the way to the top says storr in mechanical engineering its sometimes necessary to fit one part inside another and once these parts are assembled they must stay locked together and not come apart storr says one way the team does this is by shrinking some components and for this they use liquid nitrogen the team places the component that needs to fit inside another into a bath of liquid nitrogen and shrink it at 190 degrees celsius once shrunk the team assembles the two placing the now smaller component into the larger one eventually the inner part warms up to ambient temperature and grows in size making the fit very tight and preventing them from coming apart explains storr in the past drax would send the work they now do in the machine shop to companies off site and because all other power stations in the area would do the same thing wait times would often be long and the quality of the output could vary when we do it inhouse i can keep my eye on it says storr i can reprioritise things depending on what is going to be needed back on the turbine first  weve got 100 control over it we can

affordable renewable power but people need electricity instantly  not just when its a windy night or a sunny day so until a time when storage can provide enough affordable capacity to store and supply the grid with power from ample solar and wind farms the country has to rely in part on thermal generation like gas coal and biomass reliable and available on demand yes but renewable low carbon and affordable too it can be a year ago a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers at imperial college london highlighted how a balanced mix of renewable technologies could save bill payers more than 2bn  now publicly available ofgem data on which its newly published renewables obligation annual report 201516 is based reinforces the case for government to continue to support coaltobiomass unit conversions within that technology mix why because out of all renewables deployed at large scale biomass presents the most value for money  less public funding is required for more power produced renewable costs compared drax power stations biomass upgrades were the largest recipient of renewable obligation ro support during the period 201516 the transformation from coal to compressed wood pellets has made drax the largest generator of renewable electricity in the country and by a significant margin drax power station produced more than five times the renewable power than the next biggest project supported under the ro  the london array dr iain staffell lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy imperial college london and author of electric insights  who has analysed the ofgem data commented based on ofgems renewables obligation database the average support that drax power station received was 4305 per mwh generated this compares to 8870 per mwh from the other nine largest projects biomass receives half the support of the uks other large renewable projects which are all offshore wind the average support received across all renewable generators in the ro scheme  which includes much smaller projects and all types of technology  is 58 per mwh that is around 15 per mwh more than the support received by drax ending the age of coal drax group isnt arguing for limitless support for coaltobiomass conversions and drax power station being the biggest most modern and efficient of power stations built in the age of coal  is a special case but if the ro did exist just to support lots of biomass conversions like drax but no other renewable technologies then in just one year between 201516 1bn of costs saving could have been made for the public purse drax power station may be the biggestsingle site recipient of support under the ro  but it does supply more low carbon power into the national grid than any other company supported by renewable obligation certificates rocs in fact 65 of the electricity generated at its selby north yorkshire site is now renewable thats 16 of the entire countrys renewable

will know what its used for 3 march 2017 power generation chances are wherever youve been today youve never been further than a few feet away from gypsum its equally likely however you dont know what gypsum is you might not recognise it in its raw form  a soft chalky white mineral made up of calcium and sulphur but you will recognise the things its used in buildings food fertilisers  the list goes on its a hugely versatile mineral and while its naturallyoccurring its also a byproduct of electricity generation where does gypsum come from gypsum is formed naturally when lakes or lagoons with a high amount of calcium and sulphates evaporate this evaporation leaves behind layers of sediments which eventually harden into a mineral gypsum which can then be mined its also sometimes found on the earths surface where it can give rise to spectacular natural environments like the white sands desert in new mexico or slowly crystallise underground into formations like the cave of the crystals in chihuahua mexico but gypsum can also be formed as a byproduct of industrial processes  electricity generation being one when coal is used to generate electricity it releases sulphur at drax power station flue gas desulphurisation fgd technology removes up to 90 of that sulphur dioxide  which takes the form of gypsum  a lot of it in 2016 80000 tonnes of gypsum was produced and sold by drax today that gypsum is sold to just one supplier who uses it to make plasterboard but there are a number of varied uses for this versatile mineral construction one of gypsums most abiding uses in human society has been in construction in ancient times it was used widely for making cement or as a construction material in its own right  the interior of the great pyramids of giza are lined with gypsum today its still a prominent feature of the building industry gypsum is the key component in plasterboard which is produced by passing a gypsum paste between two sheets of paper when the paper sets the resulting gypsum sandwich forms the tough and ubiquitous plasterboard today all gypsum created at drax power station is used to create plasterboard its also a core ingredient in several forms of cement making and can  in its paste form  be applied as a plaster covering for existing walls and surfaces agriculture after its use in construction gypsums most important historical use is as a fertiliser gypsum is rich in sulphur which plants  in particular oil and legume crops  need for healthy growth its the same reason why volcanic soils are particularly fertile gypsums high calcium content also helps strengthen plant cell walls and aids in the absorption of nutrients more than just helping the plants gypsum fertiliser can also help reduce soil toxicity and improve its structure by allowing water to be absorbed and to drain more efficiently arts beyond its many practical uses gypsum also has a long history in the fine arts gypsum in its plaster form often called plaster of paris after the montmartre hill where it was originally quarried can be used for sculpting and decorative ornamentation when left in its solid form gypsum is known as alabaster and has been used for millennia in monumental sculpting often as a softer alternative to marble alabaster sculptures and statues have been produced by ancient societies in egypt syria and byzantium gypsum powder has also been used as an ingredient in colours in delicate inks used in medieval illuminations as well as common blackboard chalk cooking and brewing the presence of nutrients like calcium in gypsum makes it an important ingredient in several recipes including in making certain kinds of tofu but it has a more interesting role in brewing the taste of beer is determined in part by the hardness of the water used in the process the higher the mineral content in water the harder the water soft water can be used to make sweet beers like pilsners but if you want to make a bitter beer gypsum can be added to harden the water with its high sulphur and calcium content which in turn strengthens the flavour its worth mentioning however that only naturallyoccurring gypsum is used in cooking and brewing gypsum acquired through desulphurisation processes is only used in industrial contexts like building medicine as it is malleable and sets quickly sometimes within just a few minutes gypsum has proven an ideal material for sculpting casts and splints and anyone who has braces fitted knows only too well the unpleasant feeling of a plaster mould settling over the inside of their mouths thats gypsum too with an end date fixed for coal  its already a diminishing form of electricity generation  this in turn means less gypsum will created as a byproduct and sold to industry and while this means therell be less of a connection between what your home is built with and what powers it it wont mean that youre any less connected to gypsum every day gypsum has been a part of life for a long time unlike coal its one that will stick around tags coal  drax power station  technology getting more from less 22 january 2017 power generation what can we do to ensure plant integrity increase plant efficiency

less fuel to get more electricity he says a small percentage increase in biomass efficiency can represent huge cost savings he adds but as a relatively new fuel biomass  in draxs case compressed wood pellets  presents a unique challenge for the engineers working with it the biomass challenge in the days when drax ran only on coal at full load as part of a stable national grid turbine maintenance meant facing common problems where we had problems which were familiar from one hundred years of turbine history  we knew what to look for varley explains but now the plant generates within a far more demanding network that needs flexibility and produces more than half its power using compressed wood pellets theres a need for greater efficiency  it means more innovative thinking and new challenges for example most plants in the industry take each turbine offline to maintain it every eighttoten years but using wood pellets means the turbines need to be as efficient as possible and this means more regular inspections every four years we go back overhaul the module and maximise its efficiency again thats new to the industry within the uk nobody else is doing that he says despite the challenges varley isnt fazed the technical and management challenges they both come with experience he explains his engineering experience began before his start at drax as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game destined for grease my dads been in engineering all his life hed be building a car and id be dragged to a scrap man to help take an engine block out of an old car so he could use it at home varley says i was destined to always be covered in grease so when it came to beginning his career varley was set on what path he wanted to take two options presented themselves working as a trainee draftsman in an air conditioning company or taking an apprenticeship with national power an early visit to drax helped make his decision even though id been around engineering with my dad as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game he took the apprenticeship which led him to a number of power plants but the impression of the drax turbine hall never left him later in my career i spent a lot of my time going around different power stations and in grandness and scale ive never come across anything that matches what weve got at drax so when this job came about and i was asked to join i said sounds good to me today his position of getting more megawatts out of the door for less whilst ensuring safe operation of the plant is one that comes with a lot of responsibility and is built on a long history the guy who was doing this job before me took a lot of pride in it he used to say ive been here man and boy i was even here when it was built and i wouldnt have retired until i knew it was in safe hands varley says i suppose thats the best recognition i could
