Press Release
Drax delivers laptops for learners to ensure Dumfries & Galloway’s students are not left behind in their studies
27 April 2021
Press releases

Energy company Drax is delivering 320 more laptops with prepaid internet access to schools and colleges local to its operations across Britain, to ensure students whose learning has been affected by Covid lockdowns can catch-up.
Three schools, across Dumfries & Galloway will receive 20 of the Drax HP Chromebook laptops with pre-paid dongles – taking the total donated by Drax to schools in Dumfries & Galloway to 92.
The latest donation takes the total number of laptops provided by Drax, to more than 90 schools, to around 1,200, over the last 12 months.
Energy company Drax is furthering its commitment to supporting the education of children and young people local to its operations, by donating 20 more laptops to two schools across Dumfries & Galloway, to ensure no child is left behind as a result of the Covid pandemic.
The donation is part of a national effort, which has seen the company donate over 1,200 laptops to 90 schools across Britain, to ensure no child is left behind as a result of school closures.
The £60,000 investment includes three months of pre-paid internet access via a 30GB dongle, to enable students to catch-up on missed learning following the re-opening of schools as the UK’s third lockdown comes to an end.
The laptops are being delivered to Drax’s partner schools local to its operations across Britain as part of the energy company’s efforts to support its communities as they recover from the ongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. It follows the launch of Drax’s Mobilising a Million initiative, which aims to connect with one million people by 2025 to improve skills, education, employability and opportunity.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“We’ve given around 1,200 laptops to almost 100 schools since the Covid crisis started. Ensuring no child is left disadvantaged as a result of the pandemic is crucial if we are to avoid a lost generation of young people, by helping them to stay connected and catch-up on their learning.
“Drax has an important part to play in making sure we have a future workforce with the skills to deliver the new technologies needed to decarbonise the economy and meet the UK’s net zero target. We hope this donation will make a significant contribution to the UK’s green recovery from Covid.”
Dumfries and Galloway MP and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has welcomed further support by the Drax Group to school pupils and students, both nationally and in his own constituency.
Mr Jack said:
“I know from my own constituents, particularly those living near the Galloway Hydro Scheme, just how much young learners valued the use of the laptops and free internet access previously provided by Drax.
“The last year has been very challenging for everyone, not least for the generation of young people whose education has been disrupted by Covid-19 lockdowns.
“Now that school children and college students are returning to the classroom, amidst extensive measures to keep them safe, the additional laptops being provided by Drax will again be extremely useful and appreciated.
“One lesson I believe has been highlighted through the current health crisis is the importance of internet access and good broadband connections — an area of technology, particularly in rural areas, I wish to see further improved in the coming years.”
Joanna Campbell, Principal of Dumfries and Galloway College, said:
“This donation of laptops and access to the internet from Drax will make a huge difference to students whose education has been impacted during the last year. These laptops will be essential, in giving access to the internet so students can catch-up on missed learning, whilst supporting their ongoing education.”
Last year Drax donated more than 850 laptops to over 40 partner schools. This takes the total package of support Drax has provided to the communities in which it operates during the Covid crisis to almost three quarters of a million.

Drax delivers virtual work experience to boost employability during Covid crisis
19 April 2021
Press releases

Drax Group has offered students a virtual insight into the world of work as part of the energy company’s continued support for STEM education, supporting its efforts to increase social mobility for one million people.
The virtual work experience programme ran online, during the school holidays providing students with an insight into working in the energy sector.
Drax Power Station usually hosts dozens of school pupils during its work experience programmes each year, as well as thousands of visitors from schools and colleges who enjoy free educational tours.
However, during the Covid crisis all educational visits to the site have had to stop, to reduce Covid risks and protect Drax’s keyworkers, who operate its power stations and keep the lights on for millions of homes and businesses across England and Scotland.
To ensure they’re not missing out on the valuable insights they gain from work experience programmes, the energy company put together a four-day online programme for disadvantaged students from schools across England.
It has plans to roll the virtual work experience programme out nationally, supporting the company’s Mobilising a Million initiative, which aims to increase social mobility by creating opportunities to support education and improve employability, ensuring the country has the skilled workforce needed to support a post-covid, green economic recovery.
Drax Group’s Head of Sustainable Business, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children from all backgrounds to study STEM subjects, so the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow.
“With students unable to visit our sites during the Covid crisis, it’s essential they don’t miss out on the opportunities businesses like Drax would usually provide.
“Virtual Work Experience builds on the work we’ve already done to provide laptops, free internet access and virtual tours of the power station to ensure no students are left behind in their studies during the lockdown.”
Students who applied to take part in Drax’s virtual work experience programme could choose from four different business streams: Engineering, Business Support, IT and Project Management & Finance.
Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills, Gillian Keegan said:
“Giving young people the chance to gain a first glimpse into the workplace is vital to inspire their career goals and open their eyes to the wide range of opportunities available to them.
“It’s fantastic to see Drax offering these brilliant opportunities.”
Drax partnered with Teach First to deliver its virtual work experience programme – an educational charity which aims to build a fair education for all by tackling inequality in the sector.
Russell Hobby, CEO of Teach First said:
“Even before the pandemic hit, the poorest pupils were too often left behind. Their odds of succeeding at school and in the working world are now even tougher as a result of Covid-19. Work experience is a vital opportunity for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain the skills and connections they need to succeed. We’re grateful to businesses like Drax for helping to make sure that every child can maximise their potential.”
Participants in Drax’s virtual work experience programme learnt about the energy company, focusing on developing employability skills and learning about their business area through conversations with employees and targeted projects. They also had the opportunity to ask members of Drax’s executive committee about their careers during a Q&A session.
Engineering student Tahmid Md said:
“This was a great week and I’ve learnt a lot from the experience. The CV building and interview sessions were especially helpful, and I really enjoyed the engineering projects I took part in.”
This year’s Covid lockdown resulted in many students being home schooled for months, so the Drax virtual work experience programme took place during the Easter Holidays, so that participants did not miss any more vital classroom time during the school term.
Drax plans to host two more virtual work experience programmes during the summer and October school holidays.

Editor’s Notes
When Covid restrictions ease and it is safe to do so, Drax intends to resume its usual work experience programme on site, but it will continue to host a virtual programme online as well.
This will enable more students to participate from across England, who may previously have found it difficult to take part, due to barriers preventing their attendance, such as geography, opportunity and economic factors.
Drax announced its
Mobilising a Million
initiative earlier this year, when it published its Opportunity Action Plan in partnership with the Social Mobility Pledge led by former Education Secretary, the Rt Hon Justine Greening.
Drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations. It has invested more than £750,000 to support its customers and local communities during the Covid-19 crisis including donating 850 laptops to schools and colleges across the country, helping to make sure children without access to computers or the internet at home, were not left behind in their studies during the Covid crisis.

Drax completes acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc.
13 April 2021
Press releases

The acquisition positions Drax as the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business. It received overwhelming support from both sets of shareholders with 95.97% of Pinnacle’s and 99.99% of Drax’s shareholders voting in favour.
It transforms Drax into a truly international business, trading bioenergy from the North America continent to Europe and Asia, and positions the enlarged Group to take advantage of global growth opportunities, with the market for biomass pellets for renewable generation in Europe and Asia expected to grow significantly.
This large and geographically diversified asset base enhances Drax’s sourcing flexibility and security of supply.
The acquisition will increase Drax’s annual operational capacity to 4.9 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets from 2022, at 17 plants in locations across Western Canada and the US South – up from 1.6Mt now. Of this increased capacity, 2.9 million will be available for Drax’s self-supply requirements from 2022. It will also give the Group access to four deep water port facilities and three major wood fibre baskets.
By advancing the strategy to increase self-supply and reduce biomass production costs, the acquisition paves the way for the Company’s plans to deliver Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.
By becoming a world leader in BECCS, Drax can deliver on its purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future, and achieve its ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030.  Drax will seek to export its BECCS expertise around the world to support global efforts to address the climate emergency.
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer of Drax, said:
“This is an exciting and important acquisition which positions Drax as the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business. I am delighted to welcome our new Pinnacle colleagues to the Drax family and look forward to what we can achieve together.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner in the control room at Drax Power Station [Click to view/download]
“As well as making Drax an international supplier of sustainable biomass, this deal advances our strategy to increase self-supply, reduce our own biomass production cost and create a long-term future for sustainable bioenergy. We expect to benefit greatly from Pinnacle’s operational and commercial expertise.
“Through this deal we are also advancing our plans to use BECCS to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year and become a carbon negative company by 2030. Negative emissions from BECCS are vital if we are to address the global climate emergency. BECCS will also provide a significant share of the renewable electricity needed in a net zero economy, support green jobs and drive growth in a post-COVID recovery.”

Achieving UK climate goals is £4.5bn cheaper with BECCS at Drax
12 April 2021
Press releases

Deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) at Drax will save the UK more than £4.5bn over the coming decade rising to £5bn by 2050 in meeting its climate goals, .
BECCS is an essential negative emissions technology that can help the UK to meet its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2032, an important milestone in the journey towards achieving net zero by 2050.
Drax plans to capture millions of tonnes of CO
2
a year by developing two BECCS units by 2030, delivering 40% of the negative emissions from BECCS the UK Climate Change Committee indicates will be needed in 2050 for the UK to reach net zero.
Developing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) at Drax could save the UK energy system and consumers billions of pounds over the next decade, according to
a new report
.

The independent analysis by leading energy consultancy Baringa, commissioned by Drax Group, evaluates the impact of deploying BECCS at scale as part of achieving the country’s climate change targets.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner in the control room at Drax Power Station [Click to view/download]
It finds that without BECCS at Drax Power Station the energy system would incur additional costs of around £4.5bn to achieve the UK Government’s fifth carbon budget in 2028 to 2032 – making decarbonisation more difficult and significantly more expensive.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Innovative green technologies like BECCS can save the UK billions of pounds in achieving our legally binding climate targets, whilst removing millions of tonnes of CO
2
from the atmosphere and supporting tens of thousands of jobs.
“Drax is ready to invest in this essential technology which will help the UK decarbonise faster and kickstart a whole new industry here. By delivering BECCS, the UK can show the world what can be achieved for the environment and the economy when governments, businesses and communities work together.”
Not developing BECCS at Drax, or more widely across the country, will also have significant costs for the UK reaching its net zero by 2050 target. The report estimates the target will cost £15bn more to achieve without deploying this essential negative emissions technology.
With the right investment framework from government, work to build Drax’s first two BECCS units could get underway as soon as 2024, ready to start capturing and storing millions of tonnes of CO
2
a year in 2027.
Drax has already transformed its power station near Selby in North Yorkshire to become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe having converted it to use sustainable biomass instead of coal. It plans to go further by using BECCS and last month
kickstarted the planning process

Editor’s Notes
The Baringa
Value of Biomass with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in Power
, report found that:
Without BECCS at Drax providing negative emissions in the late 2020s, it will cost the UK £4.5bn more to achieve the fifth carbon budget and require much more challenging action by consumers.*
The fifth carbon budget is a
legally binding milestone
which caps the amount of greenhouse gases which can be emitted over a five-year period – between 2028 and 2032, with the overall aim of reducing the UK’s emissions to net zero by 2050.
Not deploying BECCS at Drax Power Station would mean the UK could not deliver this important negative emissions technology until at least the 2030s.
Using BECCS technology on two of Drax’s biomass units could capture eight million tonnes of CO
2
each year (MTpa). This means Drax could deliver 40% of the Climate Change Committee’s 2050 net zero BECCS power target by 2030.
In all modelled scenarios, the report found, “Our economic analysis suggests the Drax BECCS-power project is a ‘no regrets’ option, across a wide range of scenario conditions, to enable the UK to meet net-zero in a cost optimal manner.”
*August 2021 update following further research from Baringa: Without BECCS at Drax providing negative emissions in the late 2020s, it will cost the UK £13bn more to achieve the fifth carbon budget and require much more challenging action by consumers.

Siemens helps Cruachan Hydroelectric Power Station remove F-gas switchgear and replace with clean air technology
7 April 2021
Press releases

Siemens has installed four maintenance and F-Gas free generator circuit breakers at Drax Group’s subterranean pumped hydro storage power station in the Scottish Highlands
Siemens has completed a major project with Drax Group to upgrade the infrastructure in the iconic Cruachan pumped hydro storage Power Station with greener technology. Replacing equipment that was over 30 years old, the project included the UK’s first installation of four modern Siemens generator circuit breakers that do not depend on the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas commonly used in switchgear.
Cruachan underground pumped hydro storage plant, also known as the Hollow Mountain, supplies up to 440 megawatts of flexible, on-demand electricity to the National Grid from four reversible turbines and has played a critical role in stabilising the UK’s electricity system throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.
SF6 gas has traditionally been used in circuit breakers due to its good insulation capabilities but is classed as a greenhouse gas. Siemens’ innovative non-SF6 generator breakers use vacuum technology instead, making them safer and more environmentally friendly. There is no risk of gas leakages and no need for costly maintenance carried out by specialist engineers. Built from materials that are completely recyclable and hermetically sealed, the vacuum circuit breakers also have fewer moving parts, reducing wear and significantly boosting reliability. Each vacuum interrupter has a mean time to failure of 77,000 years and can run through 10,000 operating cycles before a service is required – for Cruachan, that equates to ten years of maintenance-free operation.
Cruachan Power Station provides fast, reliable power to the National Grid, as well as the flexibility to absorb excess power – meaning it can start generating or pumping electricity within less than a minute, as well as providing system support services to maintain secure supplies of electricity and support more renewables like wind and solar to come onto the grid. Using a generator circuit breaker simplifies Cruachan’s operational procedures, synchronizing the load and avoiding extensive damage inside the transformer.
“With Cruachan playing a vital role in supporting the growth of wind power in Scotland and enabling further decarbonisation of the grid, it is only right that the infrastructure inside the power station is also environmentally friendly,” explains Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Head of Hydro. “Working closely with Siemens, we retrofitted a first-of-its-kind solution that uses innovative vacuum circuit breaker switching instead of SF6 gas. Not only has this removed any potential environmental impact and health and safety concerns caused by the previous, outdated switchgear – the new generator breakers are practically maintenance free, reducing costs. It’s a really neat solution.”
Ross Fraser, technical manager, Power & Utilities, Siemens adds:
“Cruachan Power Station is contracted to provide reliable, clean electricity to the grid, so it is paramount that the technology installed is dependable, safe and sustainable. Siemens vacuum circuit breakers are built on more than 40 years of engineering experience and have proven their reliability in installations all over the world, so we are delighted that Drax chose this solution for the UK’s first implementation inside a hydro power station. The project was certainly unique as we were working 1km underground at the heart of Ben Cruachan mountain, but by working very closely with the Drax team, we achieved a quick turnaround and had the first unit fitted in under 12 months during planned maintenance downtime.”
The generator circuit breakers were installed after being transported through a narrow, one-kilometre long tunnel that leads deep into Ben Cruachan mountain. The work had to take place over the course of two years during planned maintenance downtime to reduce disruption to this critical national infrastructure.

Drax cooling tower shines bright on National Day of Reflection for COVID anniversary
23 March 2021
Press releases

Employees from across Drax’s UK sites will take part in a minute’s silence, to remember the 143,000 people that have lost their lives across the country since the first lockdown began on March 23 last year.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Plant Director said:
“This day of reflection will allow everyone to remember those who have died since the pandemic started – bringing people together to pause, reflect and support each other.
“We have been in awe of the NHS and other carers and key workers who have done so much to help those who have suffered as a result of this disease and to keep the country going.
“Our own key workers at Drax have worked tirelessly, round the clock, to continue generating the renewable electricity we all rely on. Lighting up one of our cooling towers will, I hope, be a beacon of hope to the Yorkshire region.”
This isn’t the first time Drax has used its 114m tall cooling towers to show its support during the pandemic. Last year
one of its cooling towers shone blue each Thursday
as part of the national ‘Clap for Carers’ initiative which recognised the work of the NHS and other carers during the first wave of the pandemic.
There will be a minute’s silence at mid-day on Tuesday March 23 as part of the national day of reflection. Drax’s cooling tower will be lit up from 8pm to midnight that evening.
