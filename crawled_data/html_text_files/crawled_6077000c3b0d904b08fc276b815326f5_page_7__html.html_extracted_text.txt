Third generation Drax technician wins hat trick of awards
22 November 2022
Press releases

Patrick Harpham, whose Grandad and Great-Grandad spent much of their careers working at Drax Power Station, was not only named Technical Apprentice of the Year (Year 1) by his colleagues at Drax Power Station but has also received the Mechanical Apprentice of the Year and the Award for Excellence from HETA (Humberside Engineering Training Academy) where the apprentices start their training.
Patrick Harpham
Patrick, age 20, said:
“I’m really grateful for winning three awards. I’d like to thank everyone at HETA and in the Drax technical training team who supported me through my first year. I’ve enjoyed coming onto site at Drax, learning about how the plant works and getting to know the business and what it stands for.
“My great-Grandad helped to build Drax, and my Grandad worked in the turbine team. This is what really inspired me to go for the job and got me where I am today. My Grandad has talked to me a lot about what he did at Drax, and it makes me really excited about what my career could be like in the future.”
Several other young apprentices from across the group also won top prizes at the UK’s biggest renewable power station’s annual apprentice awards event in recognition of their achievements over the past year.
Sam Plumb and Drax Plant Director, Bruce Heppenstall
Sam Plumb, age 23 from Gainsborough, was awarded both Technical Apprentice of the Year (Year 4) and the Paul Chambers Outstanding Achievement Award.
Sam, who has helped to lead the BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) apprentice project, including forming and managing an apprentice rota, said:
“It’s great to be recognised for my hard work and to celebrate with the other apprentices I’ve worked with over the last few years.
“I enjoyed taking the lead on the apprentice BECCS project this year which included doing regular checks, taking readings and diagnosing faults. I’m looking forward to putting into practice what I’ve learnt at Drax, settling into my permanent role and hopefully at some point completing further qualifications such as a HNC and HND.”
The 55 apprentices from across the group gathered at the Drax Sports and Social Club for the celebration which also included a day of team building activities. This is the first time since before the Covid pandemic that the event has been able to be held in person.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Plant Director, who hosted the event, said:
“Drax is committed to championing and supporting people in their early careers. Hiring and developing a talented workforce of the future is essential for a business like Drax, as we strive to deliver cutting edge climate-saving technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
“Apprentices all have unique talents and bring a new perspective, that we can learn from. It’s been fantastic to be able to hand out the awards to this year’s winners and celebrate their achievements in person after having held the awards virtually the last couple of years due to Covid. All the apprentices should be extremely proud of themselves, they have a bright future ahead of them.”
Sam Easthill, Sam Plumb, James Taylor, Simran Ley, Bruce Heppenstall, Patrick Harpham, Declan Farmer and Luke Crossland
This year’s winners were:
Technical Apprentice of the Year (Year 1) and winner of the HETA Mechanical Apprentice of the Year and Award for Excellence – Patrick Harpham, age 20 from Selby

HETA Electrical Apprentice of the Year – Sam Easthill, age 23 from Cliffe near Selby
Drax’s long-running apprenticeship scheme is part of its commitment to developing new talent as well as upskilling the workforce across the region. Drax has 55 apprentices as well as 57 existing employees working towards apprenticeship qualifications at other career levels within the business.
The craft and technical apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers. It is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation. In addition to engineering disciplines, Drax also offers apprenticeship qualifications in business support areas such as HR, cyber security, IT, facilities and network security.
Earlier this year, Drax launched a major public consultation at its North Yorkshire power station to advance its plans to deploy the pioneering negative emissions technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). If successful, Drax could develop two BECCS units by 2030, capturing and storing at least 8 million tonnes of CO
2
a year.
Scaling up BECCS at Drax would support over 10,000 jobs at its peak which is why it is vital that the region’s workforce has the skills needed to implement this green energy technology, enabling the UK to meet its 2050 net zero target whilst generating the renewable electricity the country needs.

Drax invests in 30 new rail wagons supporting energy security and jobs whilst cutting supply chain emissions
15 November 2022
Press releases

Drax, the UK’s biggest generator of renewable electricity, is expanding its rail fleet by investing in 30 new rail wagons to deliver the biomass it needs to generate enough renewable power for four million UK homes at its North Yorkshire power station.
The upgraded high-capacity wagons manufactured by British firm WH Davis will help to further reduce Drax’s carbon emissions and make its biomass supply chain more resilient and efficient.
Drax’s fleet of 225
rail wagons
, the first of their kind in the world, were designed and developed by Lloyd’s Register Rail (now Ricardo Rail) and
WH Davis
based in Mansfield – the UK’s last independent freight wagon manufacturer.
The innovative design of these new wagons has increased the amount of biomass able to be transported in each wagon by 30 per cent, allowing them to carry 71.6 tonnes of biomass each, reducing the number of rail journeys required and reducing supply chain emissions.
The first of 30 new wagons are expected to come off the production line early next year and go into operation delivering biomass from the Port of Tyne to Drax, reducing emissions on this route by over 25%.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Plant Director, said: “Our biomass trains deliver up to 30,000 tonnes of biomass to the power station each day, enabling Drax to power millions of homes and businesses across the UK with reliable, renewable electricity and support energy security.
“It’s therefore vital that we have a robust supply chain and investing in these new wagons will further increase our resilience and cut carbon emissions on our Tyne to Drax rail route by more than a quarter, whilst continuing to support thousands of jobs across the North, including at WH Davis and Davis Wagon Services’ facilities.”
Since it converted two thirds of its power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, Drax has transformed its business to become Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project and the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator, playing a critical role in energy security.
This transformation has also preserved and supported jobs – with Drax’s operations supporting almost 6,000 jobs across the North at a time when other power stations have closed.
Each train is able to carry sufficient biomass for Drax to generate enough reliable renewable electricity to supply around 800 UK homes for a year.
Jonathan Hamer, Managing Director of WH Davis, said: “These additional 30 new biomass wagons reflect the strength and depth of the Davis Group, including Davis Wagon Services, to provide a full turnkey solution for customers from manufacture to maintenance. This contract builds on the previous supply to Drax for its unique biomass wagon fleet requirements and shows their confidence in the quality and reliability of the WH Davis product.
“As the only rail freight manufacturer in the UK it is important for us to win such contracts to ensure the continuity of skills within our locally based work force. Drax’s confidence in us allows this to continue and develop.”
Mark Fletcher, Member of Parliament for Bolsover, said: “This is a fantastic investment which will strengthen the UK’s energy security whilst supporting local skilled manufacturing jobs.
“These new wagons will help keep the lights on for many years to come, and they are a real example of how British companies can lead the world in innovation and engineering; I am proud to have such a great company based in the Bolsover Constituency.”
Drax’s biomass comes into the ports on the east and west coasts from North America and Europe, and is brought to the power station by rail, because it is more efficient than road transportation.
Drax is committed to boosting the region’s economy by investing in skills, innovation, transport, and culture. A
recent study
found that Drax contributes over £700 million to the North’s economy and supports close to 6,000 jobs.

Notes to editors:
By using biomass, Drax has delivered carbon savings of almost 100 per cent compared to when the power station only used coal to generate electricity.
More than 95% of the electricity Drax Group produced in 2021 was renewable from its biomass and hydro operations – enough to power five million households.
The majority of the biomass Drax uses comes from North America and Europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the UK (Immingham, Hull, Port of Tyne and Liverpool). It is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail.
Drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day (over a six-day working week) in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 11 per cent of the UK’s renewable electricity.
The fuel is transported to Drax via rail rather than road, to further reduce carbon emissions, as it is more efficient than road transportation.
Independent research by
Oxford Economics
using 2021 data showed that Drax supported over 17,800 jobs across the country – almost 6,000 of which were across the North of England (Yorkshire and Humber, North West and North East). In addition Drax generated £749m for the Northern regional economy and £1.8 billion for the whole of the UK.
Drax continues to progress its plans to deliver a green jobs boom in the UK in the years ahead by becoming a world leader in negative emissions technology BECCS and investing billions of pounds in renewable energy projects.
Drax aims to source 80% of the services and materials for BECCS from British businesses, and it recently signed an agreement with British Steel to explore opportunities to source steel for the construction from the firm’s Scunthorpe and Teesside plants.
Thousands of jobs could start being created at Drax in just a couple of years’ time, with work to deploy BECCS at Drax Power Station set to get underway as soon as 2024, with around 10,000 jobs being created and supported during the project’s peak.

Families enjoy spooktacular fun at Drax’s Skylark Centre
31 October 2022
Press releases

The two days of events during the October half-term holidays also featured spine-tingling STEM (science technology engineering and maths) themed activities to suit children of all ages including exploring magic potions for wannabe wizards and witches and a creepy ‘Make Your Own Blood’ session for budding vampires.
Isis Breach-Birchall, aged 11 from Goole
A ‘dead famous gravestones walk’ and ‘scattered skeletons’ game run by the Drax visitor centre team rounded off the family day out at the 350-acre nature reserve at Barlow, near Selby, which forms part of the power station site.
The drop-in event saw almost 500 children and adults join the ghoulishly good fun at the nature reserve. Developed by Drax in the early 1970s, it is now home to a variety of wildlife and is also a valuable educational resource for schools, colleges and local nature groups.
Jane Breach, Community Engagement & Visitor Centre Team Leader at Drax, said: “We’ve not been able to run Halloween events at the Skylark Centre for the last two years due to Covid restrictions, so it was fantastic to see families and visitors of all ages enjoying the half-term STEM activities with us this year. There will be plenty more great events coming up next year and we look forward to seeing everyone again then.”
Amber Kilmartin, aged 8 from Selby
Alexa Kilmartin from Selby, who attended the event with her two daughters, said: “This was our first time visiting the Skylark Centre. It was recommended to us by a friend and I’m really glad we know about it now. We’ve had a great day, the girls have loved the activities especially making their own blood. We’ll definitely look out for what events are running here in the future.”
Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, Drax Power Station welcomed more than 12,000 visitors each year. The power station reopened earlier this year to welcome schools and colleges for
educational tours

Drax begins £2M upgrade at historic hydro power station
10 October 2022
Press releases

Tongland power station, near Kirkcudbright, is part of the Galloway Hydro Scheme which was developed in the 1930s. The scheme has six power stations, eight dams and a network of tunnels, aqueducts, and pipelines which spans around 40 miles from north to south.
The project at Tongland is part of a wider £10m investment programme by Drax, which aims to protect and fully restore its historic hydro power stations.
As part of the refurbishment, Tongland Power Station’s exterior walls will receive a new concrete coating as well as a coat of mineral-based paint to protect the integrity of the building for decades to come.
The refurbishment works are being carried out by Gunite (Eastern) Ltd who are one of the country’s leading multi-disciplined specialist contractors.
Jim Cooper, Technical Sales Manager (Infrastructure) said:
“I know that I speak for everyone here at Gunite (Eastern) when I say that we are all very much looking forward to working in partnership with Drax Hydro to deliver this prestigious project.”
Mike Wynd, Drax’s Head of Hydro, said:
“The Galloway Hydro Scheme has been generating flexible, renewable electricity for almost 90 years, and this major refurbishment will ensure it continues to do so for many years to come.
“Scotland has a long and proud history of hydroelectricity, and with this series of multi-million-pound investments Drax is ensuring these power stations will play an important role for many years to come.”
Drax acquired the Galloway hydro scheme alongside the Lanark hydro scheme and the Cruachan pumped-hydro storage facility in Argyll in January 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, low carbon and renewable power generation.

Editor’s Notes
The Tongland Power Station refurbishment programme is scheduled to begin in September 2022 and be completed by May 2023.
The paint used in the project is mineral based, and chemically bonds with the concrete to allow water to evaporate from the concrete.
Prior to work starting at Tongland power station, it will be scaffolded and wrapped in plastic to protect the building while the work is completed.
Including the refurbishment of Tongland, Drax is investing around £10m on its run-of-river hydro assets including refurbishing Stonebyres and Bonnington power stations near Lanark and upgrading the Glenlochar barrage on the Galloway scheme.

A statement from Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner on Drax’s biomass sourcing
6 October 2022
Press releases

As the world’s leading producer and supplier of sustainable biomass, Drax is committed to ensuring the biomass we source delivers positive outcomes for the climate, for nature and for the communities in which we operate.
To be clear, not all biomass is sustainable or renewable, but when sourced in the right way it does lead to the positive outcomes we are committed to delivering, and we have clear policies and processes in place to ensure this is the case.
As CEO, I understand that achieving and sustaining these positive outcomes needs constant challenge – both internally and externally – particularly with those that don’t share our vision of the critical role biomass has to play in decarbonising our economy.
That is why my team and I dedicate so much of our time to engaging with both advocates and critics of biomass, and whilst these conversations frequently challenge us, they can ultimately make us think differently and change the way we operate for the better.
Biomass remains a relatively new part of the energy mix and it is increasingly important that accurate information is readily available for those wanting to learn more about what we do. We take all claims relating to our business very seriously and investigate them, but equally we feel it is important to identify those occasions where allegations levied against us are misleading or simply untrue.
This week, we have seen inaccurate statements about Drax that have focused primarily on the views of a vocal minority who oppose biomass. Many of these claims have sought to repeat the inaccurate views about biomass, which have for years been promoted by those who are ill-informed about the science behind sustainable forestry and climate change, and those who have vested interests in seeing the biomass industry fail. Given the severity of the false claims made, I wanted to directly address some of the issues:
1. Biomass protects and enhances the environment
Done right, biomass plays a critical role in protecting and enhancing our environment. Not only does biomass displace fossil fuels directly in the production of electricity, it also supports markets for wooden products used in construction that replace the use of other carbon intensive materials like cement.
The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – the world’s leading science-based climate authority, backed by thousands of scientists – restated in their latest report the critical role that biomass will play in meeting global climate targets when sourced sustainably.
The forests that we source our biomass from are managed in accordance with best practices designed to support the health and growth of these forests over the long term. For example, in Canada, forest management has helped stop the spread of disease and forest fires that have destroyed forest ecosystems and the biodiversity which exists there.
In the South of the US, we take
thinnings
that help to open up the forest canopy and get light onto the forest floor, which in turn supports habitats for insects, wildflowers and species such as
quail
, which have been in decline.
2. Demand for pellets does not drive deforestation
Demand for pellets is not driving deforestation.  Canada has a 0% deforestation rate.  In the US South, forest inventory has more than doubled since the 1950s.  The demand for pellets is a tiny fraction of overall demand for wooden products, less than 0.1% in the US. In Canada less than half a percent (0.36%) is harvested each year, with pellets being a fraction of that demand.
The sawdust, bark, wood chips, and thinnings as well as diseased and damaged wood produced when the forests are harvested for other sectors makes up a small proportion of the total fibre harvested – just 5% in British Columbia and 4% in the south of the US. (Forest harvest statistics show wood pellet production (woody biomass) accounts for about 4% of material harvested in the US according to UN’s
FAOSTAT Forestry
. In British Columbia, 74 million cubic meters (m3) harvested through the BC
Annual Allowable Cut
, converted to metric tonnes (mt) is about 45 million mt. BC exported 2.37 million mt of wood pellets, which is 5.3% of overall harvest).
3.
What are Category Two Licences and why does Drax hold them?
Under the Category Two Licence programme in British Columbia, Canada, Drax is eligible to bid for tenure agreements on plots of land that are issued by the British Columbia Timber Sales Programme (BCTS) which is an arm of Government.
The Category Two Licence program is based on a well-established and legislated process.
The bidding procedure is a sealed, online process and if successful, Drax has a power of attorney (POA) in place where all harvesting obligations become the responsibility of the sawmilling company that holds the POA. This practice is permitted under the terms of the BCTS.
It is the sawmill company which controls the harvesting and sorting processes of the forest material and thereby ensures that it gets what it needs. Drax is not involved in the harvesting or sorting process.
We have arrangements with the sawmills we work with to supply us with sawmill residuals – sawdust, chips and bark which is used to produce wood pellets in exchange for the rights to the timber on Category Two Licences. The economics of the wood pellet industry do not facilitate full scale harvesting for the manufacture of pellets.
Drax’s name stays on the licence’s paperwork because the company is the bid winner. This does not mean Drax undertakes any harvesting activity.
Drax currently holds two Category Two Licences in British Columbia. At this time, we are not bidding for any more Category Two Licences in British Columbia.
The BBC claimed that one of the plots of land they featured would not have been harvested had Drax not bid on it – because there were no other bidders. In circumstances where no one bids on a plot of land, the British Columbia Government often puts it up for auction again.
4.
The BBC was wrong to give a false impression that logs were being taken from the two featured Category Two Licence areas and taken to our Meadowbank pellet plant in British Columbia
Drax did not receive any material from the two featured Category Two Licence areas in the BBC’s Panorama programme.
The truck the BBC followed and showed taking logs to the Meadowbank facility was, we believe, visiting a different area of forest to the locations of either of our Category Two Licence areas.
In the programme, the reporter says they followed the logging truck “60 miles (95km) north on the highway”, before turning off on the logging road. We don’t know where they went but we know the licenses that are in our name are 350km away from our Meadowbank facility.
The logs on that truck were what’s categorised in the forestry industry in British Columbia as left-over material that sawmills don’t want.
One of the two Category Two Licence sites the BBC focused on was felled and cleared by the sawmill company in December 2021. Whilst this sawmill did provide us with residuals relating to our agreement with them, it did not come from this site.
The forest companies control the sorting and harvesting process, to ensure they get the materials they need. Drax is not involved in that process.
Forest companies harvest the forests and cut the trees into log lengths and sort the portions by multiple product class. Usually this falls into two grades – sawlog grade logs for sawmills and pulp logs for pulp mills.
Sawlogs go to the sawmills and the rest go to where there is a market for them – if there isn’t a market, it becomes left-over and we may take it.
5.
Why did the programme show slash being left on the forest floor after harvesting?
Slash is a term used for the very low-grade material which is not merchantable.
Under the British Columbia Government harvesting rules, slash can be left on sites for up to two years to dry out before being taken to a pellet mill or burned on site.
The company we gave the POA to for the harvest of this site will ensure the slash is managed appropriately in line with the British Columbia Government’s regulations.
6. Drax’s Category Two Licences are not areas of primary forest
Primary forest is a term which organisations interpret differently. Drax, and many other organisations, refer to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
definition
for primary forest which indicates that primary forests have “no clearly visible indications of human activities”.
Drax has not acquired any Canadian licences for forests designated as primary forests under the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
definition
.
The BBC’s footage clearly showed that one of the Category Two Licence sites had a nearby road and in the British Columbian Government harvest plan for one of these sites there is a specific requirement for the “700 Road to be screened”.
In our opinion this is evidence that this area was not primary forest and we did not take any material directly from this site.
Areas identified by the Government for harvest are carefully selected by them using an exhaustive list of environmental criteria that includes but is not limited to; old growth management; landscape and site level biodiversity; age class distribution (old growth); riparian management; watershed management; wildlife management; visual quality; species at risk; rare and sensitive ecosystems; cultural heritage resources; soil quality; species diversity; site productivity; as well as social and economic considerations.
7.
Does Drax use logs which should instead be sent to sawmills to make wood products?
No. To date in 2022, the material used in our Canadian pellet plants includes 81% sawmill residuals, 8% harvest residuals and 10% roundwood, including pulp logs (grade 4).
All materials are sorted and graded by the sawmill/lumber operator before delivery to Drax. The Grade 4 logs that we use are not higher quality logs. These can be pulp grade logs, but if there is no market for pulp logs then when the sawmills harvest and sort the logs, they become leftover from sawmill material and are often then used by Drax to make pellets.
Commercial forestry is driven by a demand for high grade saw logs, which are processed in sawmills, with the resultant timber then used in construction and manufacturing.
The material that is not used for these purposes – because it is often diseased, mis-shapen or uneconomic – could be used for producing biomass, in line with our sourcing policy.
8. Rigorous independent oversight plays an important part in the governance of the biomass industry
Drax adheres to all required legislation, regulations and standards which govern the energy sector, Drax’s businesses and its supply chains. It ensures the ongoing sustainability of its feedstock in accordance with the required legislation.
The carbon accounting rules that underpin these regulations and standards have been developed in accordance with world leading international science from the
UN IPCC 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
and are derived from international frameworks such as the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (“RED”).
Companies which use biomass are required to measure and report on supply chain emissions. These requirements are unique in that they are stricter and more onerous than what is required for other energy generation technologies. As a result, Drax reports on its full supply chain and associated emissions to Ofgem under legislative requirements (including the Renewables Obligation and CfD).
Drax also provides extensive information to voluntary certification schemes, such as the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP), FSC and SFI which provide third party oversight to ensure the material we are using meets the required sustainability standards.
We publish a comprehensive overview of this data in our Annual Reports (including data on Scope 1 and 2 emissions and emissions intensity figures which are audited).
Drax makes all data and information on its emissions and catchment areas, including evidence of forest growth, growing stock, and sequestration rates (forest productivity), available for public consumption. Our supply chain emissions are reported in full in our annual report and accounts. We report all of our emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3).
In addition to this, due to the British Columbia Government’s rigorous legislative system and British Columbia Timber Sale’s SFI certification, we have every confidence that areas selected for harvest, including under the Category 2 programme, are done so to fulfill a government management objective.
This is done as part of the long-term harvest planning process by government, with industry and other stakeholders who have interests in the land, including First Nations and the general public.
Sustainable biomass is increasingly being recognised by governments and scientists around the world as having the potential to play a critical role in tackling the climate crisis, supporting communities and contributing to energy security, and I hope this information reiterates our commitment to sustainability which sits at the heart of our purpose and everything we do.

Drax response to BBC Panorama programme on Canadian Forestry
3 October 2022
Press releases

A Drax spokesperson said: “Canada has some of the most highly regulated forests in the world

which

ensures

the forests in British Columbia (BC) are managed properly and provide positive benefits to nature, the climate and people.
“People living in and around these forests are best placed to determine how they should be looked after, not the BBC. Drax’s own

world-leading

sustainable sourcing policies are aligned

with the

rigorous regulatory frameworks

and

rules set by both the BC and UK governments.
“The UN’s IPCC – the world’s leading science-based climate authority, backed by thousands of scientists –

restated

in their latest

report

the

critical

role that biomass will play in meeting global climate targets when sourced sustainably.

Biomass is used by countries around the world to provide reliable renewable energy, whatever the weather, which displaces fossil fuels like coal from energy systems, supporting climate targets.
“In this edition of Panorama,

the BBC has focused primarily on the views of a vocal minority who oppose biomass.  The programme makers have sought to repeat the inaccurate claims about biomass which have for years been promoted by those who are ill-informed about the science behind sustainable forestry and climate change and those who have vested interests in seeing the biomass industry fail.

Good journalism should start from a neutral position to seek out the facts.
“The Panorama team did not contact us while they were conducting their research in Canada to arrange to visit our facilities.

“From the outset we were presented with a series of one-sided assertions from the BBC.

Our lawyers have written to the BBC to remind them of their legal and regulatory

obligations

and we are considering further action.
“At Drax, we are open and transparent about our operations and since becoming aware of the production team’s visit to Canada, many people across our business have collectively spent hundreds of hours engaging with them

in an effort to

encourage an accurate portrayal of our business and the wider forestry industry.
“As anyone in the BC forestry industry knows, the forests there are not harvested for biomass, they are harvested for high value timber used in construction. 80% of the material used to make

our pellets at Drax in Canada is sawmill residues – sawdust, wood chips and bark left over when the timber is processed. The rest is waste material collected from the forests which would otherwise be burned to reduce the risk of wildfires and disease. This is the material used by Drax to produce 12% of the UK’s renewable

and secure

electricity, playing a vital role in keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.”
