Press Release
More than 50% of Britain’s electricity now low carbon according to ground-breaking new report
14 November 2016


Uncategorized


Low-carbon sources of energy
– such as nuclear, hydro, biomass, wind and solar –
now contribute twice as much electricity than they did in 2010 (20%)
Carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at a record low
– down a third over a 12-month period and 56% over four years
Britain now has 26GW of wind and solar installed
– a six-fold increase over the last six years, while biomass has increased from nothing to 2GW of generating capacity
Carbon Price Floor plays a big role in reducing coal’s contribution which was just 3% of the UK’s electricity last quarter
– down from 38% during the same period in 2012
Last quarter, for the first time ever, more than half (50.2%) of Britain’s electricity was produced from low-carbon energy sources, according to a new quarterly research report released today, authored
by researchers from Imperial College London in collaboration with Drax.
Between July and September 2016, the contribution of nuclear, biomass, hydro, wind, solar and low-carbon electricity imports from France peaked at 50.2%, up from just 20% in 2010 – demonstrating the scale and impact of Britain’s renewable energy revolution over the last six years, and the unprecedented changes taking place in the UK energy sector.
Launched today, the Drax Electric Insights Report is designed to shed light on the dramatic impact of these changes, which include the Government’s commitment to shift away from coal by 2025, obligations to decarbonise, policy levers including the Carbon Price Floor, commitments to new nuclear, and prices reaching new highs and new lows.
Using consolidated data produced by National Grid and Elexon, who run the electricity network and balancing market respectively, it will focus, quarter by quarter, on data charting supply and demand, prices, emissions, the performance of the various generation technologies and the networks that connect them – providing new empirical evidence to contribute to the UK energy debate.
According to this quarter’s report, nuclear energy provided the largest share of low-carbon energy over the last three months, generating over a quarter of the UK’s electricity (26%), followed by on-shore and off-shore wind (10%), solar (5%), biomass (4%), low-carbon energy imports from France (4%) and hydro (1%).The data also revealed that Britain now has 26GW of solar and wind installed, a six-fold increase since 2010, while biomass has increased from nothing to 2GW of power generation over the same period.
Crucially, the findings also reveal the sharp decline in coal which has been largely due to the increases to the Carbon Price Floor which took effect last year.  Just 3% of Britain’s electricity last quarter was generated from this fossil fuel – down from over a third (38%) during the same period in 2012 – placing it below wind, solar and biomass in the UK energy generation league tables for the very first time. In fact, for almost six full days last quarter, the UK was completely coal free – the first instance Britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity since 1881.
As the report points out, a quarter of Britain’s coal stations have shut down over the last 12-months. In the last quarter alone, coal utilisation fell to its lowest ever levels – with plants producing just 7% of their maximum capacity – less than half the productivity of Britain’s solar panels over the quarter.
According to the research, this move away from dispatchable fossil fuels, like coal, towards weather dependent renewable, while slashing emissions, is also forcing the UK power system into new challenging territories. Last quarter, at its minimum only 4.7 GW of electricity was generated from flexible dispatchable power plants, meaning they had less “breathing space” for times of low demand and high renewables output. In contrast, prior to 2013, this minimum level had never previously fallen beneath 10GW.
The report also found that volatile power prices are likely to be the new normal in the UK, with last quarter witnessing the highest energy prices for several years and an all-time low. Zero or negative power prices – when high inflexible power generation meets low demand – occurred 45 times over the last quarter, twice as many as during the whole of 2015 combined. At the same time, this quarter also saw the highest peak energy price for three years, on Thursday 15th September, when prices reached £802/MWh.
Drax Power CEO, Andy Koss, said:
“This report shows Britain’s energy system is changing dramatically and we are seeing real benefits. Cleaner energy has reached a record high, and carbon emissions from electricity hit a record low. We can also see the crucial role that policy levers like the Carbon Price Floor play.
“But there is more to do to make Britain truly low carbon.  Additional reliable, affordable, clean energy is needed on the system, along with a focus of getting the balance right. More intermittent renewables like wind and solar are crucial but they will require more flexible back up, like biomass, to provide homes and business with electricity on demand.”
Dr Iain Staffell, of Imperial’s Centre for Environmental Policy, said:
“You cannot manage what you cannot measure.  Although there is a huge amount of data available on our electricity system, before now there was no way to put it all together to see the big picture of what is happening, and more importantly why.
“My work with Drax provided an opportunity to apply my research to cut through the noise and understand Britain’s electricity is changing for the better.  We are so used to bad-news stories about the environment, so it is good to see that for once concrete progress is being made.”
The first edition of the report also found that:
Carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at a record low
– down a third over a 12-month period and 56% over four years – thanks to the rise of clean energy and the switch from coal to gas
Three quarters (76%) of the UK’s electricity consumption emissions are now produced from burning gas
, with 14% from produced burning coal – a role reversal from 2012, when coal accounted for 76% and gas 22% of these emissions respectively.
The last 12 months saw 3.2 GW of new wind and solar farms come online –
while a quarter of the country’s coal capacity came off grid
Electric Insights will be published once a quarter, and is supported by an interactive website –
www.ElectricInsights.co.uk
– which provides live data from 2009 until the present. The data sources and methodology used in Electric Insights are listed in full on the website.
Commissioned by Drax Group, owner and operator of one of the UK’s largest power stations and Europe’s biggest biomass-fuelled power plant, the report will be delivered independently by a team of academics from Imperial College London, facilitated by the College’s consultancy company – Imperial Consultants.

Drax generates £1.2bn and over 14,000 jobs for the economy says new report from Oxford Economics
7 September 2016


Uncategorized


Energy business Drax contributed more than £1 billion towards UK GDP in 2015 and supported thousands of jobs across the country. The findings were revealed in a new report looking at the Group’s UK operations, which includes Drax Power Station – Europe’s largest decarbonisation project.
Researchers at Oxford Economics studied the impact of Drax Group on the UK’s economy as the company nears completion of a major high tech engineering and infrastructure project to upgrade half the generating units at Drax Power Station near Selby in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass in place of coal. With the right support from Government, Drax aims to upgrade the remainder of the Power Station.
Their report estimates that the Group’s UK activities and that of companies in its supply chain last year
contributed £1.2 billion to the economy and supported 14,150 jobs
.
Employment covered a wide range of sectors including high-skilled manufacturing of industrial components, engineering and technical machinery, construction, IT, professional business services and transport.
This combination of activity and employment also generated tax revenues for the UK estimated at £430 million, equivalent to the salaries of almost 16,500 nurses or 12,900 teachers.
Oxford Economics used three measures to calculate Drax Group’s GDP contribution: the direct activities of the Group and its contractors, activity and employment in the supply chain of the Group and its contractors, and spending by all employees involved.
A breakdown of the GDP generated by Drax Group shows all regions of the UK benefited.
Highlights include:
£493 million created in Drax’s heartland of
Yorkshire and the Humber
.
1,100 jobs for the
North East
and £82m contributed to the local economy.
£191 million generated in the
East of England
, where the group’s retail arm
Haven Power
is based.
1,700 jobs supported in
Scotland
and £120 million generated in its economy.
550 jobs sustained and £42 million contributed to GDP in the
South West
.
The report also analysed the economic impact of upgrading Drax to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal. It reveals this project has thus far generated £710 million in GDP throughout the UK economy, and supported 11,400 jobs, half of these in construction, manufacturing and transport.
Drax Group CEO, Dorothy Thompson, said:
“This report shows Drax is supporting more than 14,000 jobs across the UK, with the vast majority resulting from our upgrades to biomass technology.
“The economic benefit has reached all parts of the country. We have been the catalyst for rejuvenation and growth across the Northern Powerhouse with port expansion on the coasts of East Yorkshire, the North West and North East.
“Drax is now the UK’s biggest single generator of renewable power. With the right support from Government we aim to upgrade more of our electricity production to using compressed wood pellets. This would provide a further boost to the UK economy, and deliver increased carbon savings.”
Sam Moore, managing director of consultancy at Oxford Economics, said:
“Drax Group makes an important economic contribution to Yorkshire and the Humber, and the UK more widely. Its activities generated over £1 billion in GDP last year, and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation.
“In addition, ambitious investments by the group and its partners in regional biomass infrastructure have driven huge demand, and supported many more thousands of jobs.
“The Drax upgrades to use biomass in place of coal are also environmentally and strategically very significant, in the context of the wider challenges for the UK’s energy system.”

Drax to save 20 millionth tonne of carbon through use of sustainable biomass
17 June 2016
Uncategorized

Drax, the UK’s largest power station – providing 7% to 8% of the UK’s power needs – will in July save its 20 millionth tonne of carbon since it started burning sustainable biomass in place of coal some 10 years ago. It expects to take only a further two and a half years to reach the 50 million tonne mark.
This latest recorded carbon saving reinforces its position as Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and the UK’s largest generator of renewable electricity from a single site¹.
Drax has already converted two generating units and with a third in the pipeline Drax will reduce its annual carbon emissions by around 12 million tonnes a year. This is equivalent to taking 3.3 million cars off the UK’s roads or making the UK’s entire industrial and manufacturing sector zero carbon² – with sustainable biomass providing a carbon saving of approximately 86 per cent compared to coal-fired generation.
Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive of Drax Group plc said:
“This latest milestone data underscores the low carbon credentials of sustainable biomass. In a relatively short period of time Drax has delivered major carbon savings, while continuing to provide reliable, secure and good value renewable power.
“This data also gives an indication of the scale of the contribution sustainable biomass will make to meeting the UK’s carbon reduction targets. Drax is already Europe’s largest decarbonisation project, and we believe that there is potential for significant additional carbon savings through the conversion of further units.”

Notes
Drax is the UK’s largest power station typically meeting 7-8% of the UK’s power needs. It is Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and the UK’s largest renewable electricity generator.
Biomass is organic material obtained from living or recently living plant matter that can be burnt to produce energy. The materials that Drax uses include low grade wood, such as forest thinnings, tree tops and branches as well as sawmill residues, and to a lesser extent residual agricultural products, such as straw, sunflower seed husks and peanut husks, and purpose grown energy crops.
Drax sources the majority of its biomass from the South Eastern US, but also from Canada and to a lesser extent other EU member states, where forest areas are growing, not declining, owing to experienced and professional sustainable forest management. The main drivers of commercial forestry practices are industries such as the furniture and construction sectors which use the main part of the tree for lumber. Drax then uses the material leftover, such as the thinnings, tree tops, limbs and other low grade wood.
Further information on the types of biomass fibre Drax uses and which countries it comes from can be found in Drax’s Biomass Supply Report 2014, available

Consumers could save £2 billion if green light given for reform of energy generation auctions
16 February 2016
Uncategorized

An independent report published today has revealed consumers could save more than £2 billion if the Government’s planned renewable energy auctions are opened up to include a wider mix of technologies. Drax commissioned NERA Economic Consulting and Imperial College to look at hidden costs that are not reflected in the contracts Government awards for renewable generation.
These hidden costs, or whole system costs are increasing as intermittent renewables – those reliant on the sun and wind – increase. These intermittent renewables mean other forms of power generation need to kick in, and flex up and down to meet electricity demand. These costs are passed on to consumers via their energy bills.
Currently the Government is planning three auctions for new renewable energy contracts – Contracts for Difference (CfDs) – planned over the next four years, and all are focused on offshore wind. The new research shows significant differences in the true costs of renewables once these additional costs are recognised. Offshore wind could require a CfD of £127 per MWh, onshore wind £92-97 per MWh, solar £96 per MWh, and biomass £84 per MWh.
Once these new support levels are modelled over the planned energy auctions, the new energy mix that could win contracts is shown to save consumers £1.9 -£2.2 billion. This support is already paid for through energy bills and the new cost-efficient mix would lessen the impact.
Drax Group CEO, Dorothy Thompson said:
“This independent research shows it’s crucial we get the right mix of energy generation.  The UK’s system faces growing challenges, from costs to reliability as traditional forms of generation are replaced with renewables.
“Intermittent renewables like wind and solar are vital as we continue to clean up energy generation, but they need to be backed up by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down to make sure the UK’s businesses and households always have power on demand.
“Opening up energy auctions to include other renewables could save consumers £2 billion and with more biomass in the mix energy security is also boosted.  Using the latest technology we’ve upgraded half our power station to run on compressed wood pellets, which give an 80% plus carbon saving against coal. With the right support we stand ready to finish the job.”
NERA Economic Consulting Associate Director, Daniel Radov, added:
“NERA Economic Consulting is pleased to be able to continue its partnership with Imperial College in modelling the total costs of different power generation technologies, and in helping to inform the policy discussion around renewable energy and decarbonisation.
“To ensure that we achieve environmental targets as efficiently as possible, it is essential to have policies in place that provide the right incentives to minimise costs. We hope the combination of Imperial’s whole-system energy modelling with NERA’s ability to model the details of the CfD auctions will contribute to a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different policy approaches.”

Notes to Editors
NERA Economic Consulting is a global firm of experts dedicated to applying economic, finance, and quantitative principles to complex business and legal challenges. NERA brings academic rigor, objectivity, and real world industry experience to bear on issues arising from competition, regulation, public policy, strategy, finance, and litigation across many sectors including energy, infrastructure and the environment. Imperial College London is a respected academic institution with experience of energy system modelling. They were chosen to ensure the modelling would be consistent with the work they produced for the Committee on Climate Change on the same topic in 2015.
The report focuses on Whole System Costs. Whole System Costs (WSC) are simply the sum of the Levelised Cost of Energy and the associated System Integration Costs for a given technology (i.e. WSC = LCOE + SIC).
The Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) is the cost of building, maintaining and operating a generation asset (i.e. power station/wind farm/solar park) over the life of the asset.  This is the figure that is currently factored into CfD auction bids. System Integration Costs (SIC) represent the additional expense of operating the electricity network as a result of those assets participating in the GB electricity market. These costs include maintaining sufficient levels of backup capacity (system reliability) and managing flows on the transmission network (system balancing). Different technologies (e.g. wind, solar, biomass, etc.) have different impacts on total System Integration Costs, depending on their reliability, flexibility and location on the system.
The Government has committed to support offshore wind capacity in the next three CfD auctions to promote technological learning and cost reduction in that technology.  This analysis proposes that a proportion of the offshore wind budget is protected in each auction to promote such benefits. The analysis demonstrates that opening a proportion of the budget to full, technology neutral competition could reduce costs to consumers by up to £2.2bn.

Drax competition celebrates release of special edition Hornby biomass wagons
1 February 2016


Uncategorized


Selby, Yorkshire: Drax is offering the chance to sit with the driver in the cab of a real biomass train on its journey to deliver compressed wood pellets from one of its four ports to the UK’s largest power station.
The winner of the first prize in the competition will also receive a set of two limited edition Hornby biomass wagons presented by Andy Koss, Chief Executive of Drax Power, and will be taken on a VIP tour of the biomass unloading facilities. Three runner up winners will each receive the limited edition Hornby biomass wagon set.
Drax processes and compresses low grade wood into small high-density pellets, turning humans’ oldest renewable energy source into a fuel that is modern and highly efficient.  The majority of the compressed pellets are imported from the huge working forests of North America which are expanding year on year. Drax’s new energy source is made from the residues and thinnings left from industries that have no use for them.
Our specially designed trains move millions of small pellets from four UK ports – Hull, Immingham, Liverpool and Tyne – to our power station with a minimal cost and environmental impact. Hornby has released two special edition model wagons in ‘OO’ gage. They have been commissioned by Drax and only 2,000 have been produced. The wagons are currently available for pre-order
here
, and 10% of all profits received will be donated to the Railway Benefit Fund.

with your name, age, phone number, postal address, and answer to this question:
Which four UK ports do Drax biomass trains pick up compressed wood pellets from before travelling to Drax Power station to generate 4% of the UK’s electricity?
The competition
closing date is Friday, 12
th
February
and the winners will be chosen the following week.
Please see below for competition terms and conditions before entering.
The largest ever rail freight wagons in the UK, our biomass wagons, were designed by Lloyd’s Register Rail and manufactured by WH Davis. The current fleet of more than 200 wagons have travelled huge distances across the UK to help Drax move away from coal and become a predominantly biomass electricity generator, making it Europe’s largest decarbonisation project. The wagons are 30 per cent larger than any other rail freight wagon currently used in the UK, and are able to carry a biomass load weighing 71.6 tonnes.

Project Update
8 January 2016
Press releases

Details have been published in the East Anglian Daily Times (and will be published again on August 26th) and on the Progress Power and Planning Inspectorate websites. Eye Library also hold details of the amendments.
Both Mid-Suffolk District Council and Suffolk County Council are aware of the proposed amendments and the reasons for making them, and Progress Power has notified other relevant parties. The consultation process is being undertaken in accordance with the Planning Inspectorate’s guidelines.
The changes are restricted to the main power generation plant site at Eye Airfield and are regarded as non-material.
The amendments to the Development Consent Order (DCO) relate to the width of the power station’s exhaust flue stack (chimney) for the single turbine unit solution only and some minor amendments to the dimensions of some buildings within the main power generation plant site. The height of the key components on site (i.e. the gas turbine generator and the stack) will not change from what was originally consented. Progress Power has permission to build up to five stacks (30m high).
The need to make amendments to the DCO became apparent during the procurement process for the power station: in order to construct the one turbine solution, minor alterations would need to be made to some of the parameters and locations of various structures consented by the DCO. There is a need to widen the visible part of the stack for the single unit solution by 1.6 metres.
Progress Power has not yet concluded the exact number of turbines that will be constructed on the site, and the stack height(s) will remain 30 metres as per the July 2015 DCO.
The consultation on the proposed non material changes to the DCO runs from August 19th to September 25th. Responses to the consultation should be addressed to the Planning Inspectorate.



8 January 2016 – Project update
Press releases

Hirwaun Power’s consented 299MW gas-fired generation project (on part of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate) did not secure a contract in the Government’s recent Capacity Market Auction for future power generation (held in December 2015) and therefore the project will not proceed during the course of this year (2016).
Given the need for new gas-fired power generation in the UK, Hirwaun Power intends to enter the project in the Government’s next Capacity Market Auction which is scheduled to be held in December 2016.
Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, the local planning authority, has been notified.



Project Update
Press releases

The decision has been made because Watt Power (the parent company of Millbrook Power) was unable to secure contracts for its two consented 299MW gas-fired generation projects (in Suffolk and in south Wales) through the Government’s recent Capacity Market Auction for future power generation (held in December 2015). If contracts are secured for these two consented projects in the Government’s next Capacity Market Auction (to be held in December 2016), Millbrook Power would look to submit a Development Consent Order application in 2017.
Both Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council, as the local planning authorities, have been notified.
