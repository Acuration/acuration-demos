energy policy drax enters formal discussions with uk government on largescale power beccs 30 march 2023 investors drax has been invited to enter formal bilateral discussions with the government immediately to move the project forward and ensure the government is able to fulfil its restated commitment to achieving 5mtpa of engineered greenhouse gas removals ggrs by 2030 drax believes that beccs at drax power station is the only project that can enable the government to achieve this goal 1  the government has also committed to publish its biomass strategy by the end of june 2023 which will set out how the technology could be deployed during 2022 carbon removal projects including power beccs were progressed in parallel with the track 1 process for gas hydrogen and industrial ccs projects while power beccs and other shortlisted projects are not included in the immediate track 1 process the government has confirmed that in 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of track 1 and has today launched track 2 beccs is eligible for both separately the government has stated that it will work closely with electricity generators currently using biomass to facilitate a transition to power beccs the government has also confirmed that its response to the power beccs business model consultation which took place in 2022 will be published imminently providing further clarity on the delivery of beccs as soon as possible drax group ceo will gardiner said delivery of beccs at drax power station will help the uk achieve its net zero targets create thousands of jobs across the north and help ensure the uks longterm energy security we note confirmation that our project has met the governments deliverability criteria and government remains committed to achieve 5mtpa of engineered greenhouse gas removals by 2030  a goal that cannot be achieved without beccs at drax power station we will immediately enter into formal discussions with government to take our project forward with the right engagement from government and swift decision making drax stands ready to progress our 2bn investment programme and deliver this critical project for the uk by 2030 the government recognises the important role which beccs will play in delivering net zero and aims to deploy 5mt of engineered co 2 removals per annum from beccs and other engineered ggr technologies by 2030 rising to 23mt in 2035 and up to 81mt in 2050 to keep the uk on a pathway to meet its legislated climate targets the sixth carbon budget and net zero drax power station is the uks largest single source of renewable electricity and beccs is the only technology that can produce reliable renewable power provide system support services and permanently remove co 2 at scale coal closure drax continues to expect to close its two legacy coal units at the end of march 2023 notes 1 in its energy white paper government noted that biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of applications in which it can be used as a substitute for fossilfuel based products and activities along with its ability to deliver permanent carbon removals government recognises that biomass is one of the uks most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions while maintaining energy security biomass is the only largescale source of dispatchable renewable electricity and drax power station in yorkshire is the largest provider of secure supply in the uks electricity system its renewable biomass generation provides 26gw of electricity representing 4 of the uks dispatchable capacity and supplies millions of homes and businesses with dispatchable reliable power the project at drax power station is expected to be the worlds biggest engineered carbon removal project permanently removing 8mt of co 2 from the atmosphere every year by 2030 the project would see the addition of post combustion carbon capture to two of the existing biomass units using sustainable biomass and technology from draxs technology partner mitsubishi heavy industries captured co 2 would be transported and permanently stored by the groups partners in the east coast cluster vivid economics concluded that it could deliver 370 million of economic benefit for the uk during construction creating and supporting more than 10000 jobs during peak construction recent baringa research also demonstrates that drax is the uks largest source of energy security and will continue to play a vital role in the uk security of supply in to the late 2020s drax aims to source 80 of materials and services for the project from british businesses and is also working with british steel to explore opportunities for its uk production facilities to supply a proportion of the steel needed for

tags energy policy  investors  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero 28 february 2022 electrification key points energy storage plays a crucial role in the uk electricity system by not only providing reserve power for when demand is high but also absorbing excess power when demand is low the uks electricity systems growing dependency on intermittent renewables means the amount of energy storage needed will increase to as much as 30 gw by 2050 there are three different durations of energy storage needed to help balance the grid shortterm daytoday and long term it will take a range of technologies including batteries pumped storage hydro and new approaches to meet the storage demands of a net zero grid when you turn on a lightbulb  in 10 20 or 30 years  the same thing will happen electricity will light up the room but where that electricity comes from will be different as the country moves toward net zero emissions  low carbon and renewable power sources will become the norm however its not as simple as swapping in renewables for the fossil fuels the grid was built around weather dependant sources like wind and solar are intermittent  meaning other sources are needed at times when theres little wind or no sunshine to meet the countrys electricity demand equally as challenging to manage however is what to do when theres an excess of power being generated at times of low demand energy storage offers a low carbon means of delivering power at times of low supply as well as absorbing any excess of generated power when demand is low helping to balance and stabilise the grid as the electricity system transforms through a range of lowcarbon and renewable technologies the amount of energy storage on the uk grid will need to expand from 3 gw of today to over 30 gw in the coming decades  the storage solution even as the uks electricity system transforms from fossil fuels to renewables the way the grid operates remains primarily the same central to that is the principle that the supply of electricity being generated must always match the demand on a secondbysecond basis too little or too much power on the system can cause power outages and damage equipment national grid needs to be able to call on reserve power sources to meet demand when supply is low or pay to curtail renewable sources output when demand drops during the summer of 2020 for example lower demand due to covid19 coupled with high renewable output resulted in balancing costs 40 above expectations  there is a lot of offshore wind coming online in scotland as much as 11 gw by 2030 and a further 25 gw planned explains steve marshall a development manager at drax offshore wind farm along the coast of scotland its great because it increases the amount of renewable power on the system but the transmission lines between scotland and england can become saturated as much as 3040 of the time because there is too much power electricity storage can provide a source of reserve power as well as absorb excess electricity these capabilities are crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring that frequency remains within a stable operating range of 50 hertz as well as providing other ancillary services  whether its absorbing power or delivering electricity needed to keep the grid stable in energy storage timing is everything  there are three main time periods electricity storage needs to operate over fastacting short term electricity because electricity supply must always match demand sudden changes mean the grid needs to respond immediately to ensure frequency and voltage remain stable and electricity safe to use batteries are considered the fastest technology for responding to a sudden spike in demand or an abrupt loss of supply battery technology has evolved rapidly in recent decades as innovations like lithiumion batteries such as those used in electric cars and emerging solidstate batteries become more affordable and more commonplace this makes it more feasible to deploy largescale installations that can absorb and store excess power from the grid batteries are good for nearinstantaneous responses it can be a matter of milliseconds for a battery to deploy power says marshall if theres a sudden problem with frequency or voltage batteries can respond  its something thats quite unique to them the speed at which batteries can deploy and absorb electricity makes them useful grid assets however even very large battery setups can only discharge power for around two hours if for example the wind dropped off for a long period the grid needs a longerduration supply of stored power powering daytoday changes in supply demand and the grid when it comes to managing the daily variations of supply and demand the grid needs to be able to call on reserves of power for when there are unexpected changes in the weather or electricity demand from users pumped storage hydro power offers a low carbon way to provide huge amounts of electricity quickly and for periods that can last as long as eight or even 24 hours the technology works by moving water between two reservoirs of water at different elevations when there is demand for electricity water is released from the upper reservoir which rushes down a series of pipes spinning water turbines generating electricity however when there is an excess of power on the electricity system the same turbines can reverse and absorb electricity to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir storing it there as a massive water battery pumped storage hydro is a longestablished technology having been developed since the 1890s in italy and switzerland in the uk today there are four pumped storage hydro power stations in scotland and wales with a total capacity of 28 gw among those is the draxowned cruachan power station in the scottish highlands the plant is made up of four generatingpumping turbines located inside ben cruachan between loch awe and an upper reservoir holding 10 million cubic metres of water turbine hall at cruachan power station pumped hydro storage facilities can rapidly begin generating large volumes of power in as little as 30 seconds or less the ability to switch their turbines between different modes  pump generate and spin mode to provide inertia to the gird without producing power  make pumped storage hydro plants versatile assets for the gird how cruachan operates depends on weather says marshall we make as many 1000 mode changes a month thats how frequently cruachan is called on by national grid as the electricity system transforms there will be a greater need for flexible energy storage like pumped storage hydro this is why drax is kickstarting plans to expand cruachan power station however the specific conditions needed for such facilities can make new projects difficult and expensive cruachan 2 to the east of the original power station will add up to 600 mw in generating capacity  more than doubling the sites total capacity to more than 1gw by increasing the number of turbines operating at the facility it increases the range of services that the grid can call upon from the site longterm electricity solutions however storage technologies as they exist today cannot alone offer all the solutions the uk will need to achieve its net zero targets while technologies like pumped storage can generate for the better part of a day longer periods of unfavourable conditions for renewables will need new approaches in march 2021 for example the uk experienced its longest cold and calm spell in more than a decade with wind farms operating at just 11 of their capacity for 11 days straight  according to electric insights the shortfall in the countrys primary source of renewable power was made up for by gas power stations but in a net zero future such responses will only be feasible if theyre part of carbon capture and storage systems or replaced by other carbon neutral or energy storage solutions generating enough power to supply an electrified future as well as being able to take pressure off the grid and provide balancing services will require a range of technologies working in tandem over extended periods interconnectors with neighbouring countries for example can work alongside storage solutions to shed excess power to where there is greater demand similarly rather than curtailing wind or solar power extra electricity could be used for electrolysis to produce hydrogen  other functions may include demand side response where heavy power users are incentivised to reduce their electricity usage during peak periods helping to reduce demand to achieve stable reliable net zero electricity systems the uk needs to act now to not only replace fossil fuels with renewables but put the essential energy storage and balancing solutions in place that means electricity is there when you turn on a lightbulb tags energy policy

intervention is needed to enable enough beccs in power to make a net zero uk economy possible by 2050 early investment in beccs can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s a twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver beccs and other net zero technologies in the time

power 1  investment in q1 2024 with the first beccs unit to be operating by 2027 the potential of beccs as part of the path to net zero has been widely recognised beccs in power is an important part of all of the climate change committee cccs net zero scenarios contributing to negative emissions of between 16 39mt co 2 e per year by 2050 2  investment needs to occur early by 2035 the ccc sees a role for 34gw of beccs as part of a mix of low carbon generation 3  the governments energy white paper commits by 2022 to establishing the role which beccs can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed the government has also committed to invest up to 1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture usage and storage ccus in four industrial clusters 4  national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes indicate that it is not possible to achieve net zero without beccs 5  however at present a business model 6 which could enable this investment is not in place a business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible there is no market for negative emissions there is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them positive spillovers are not remunerated  positive spillovers that would be delivered by a firstofakind beccs power plant but which are not remunerated include providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage ts infrastructure that can be used by subsequent ccs projects delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent beccs power plants and delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of ccs projects including hydrogen production with ccs beccs relies on the presence of co 2 transport and storage infrastructure  where this infrastructure doesnt already exist or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain this presents a significant risk to investors in beccs in power ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload frontier economics has been commissioned by drax to develop and evaluate business model options for beccs in power that could overcome these barriers and help deliver timely investment in beccs business model options we started with a long list of business model options after eliminating options that are unsuitable for beccs in power we considered the following three options in detail power contract for difference cfd the strike price of the cfd would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits carbon payment a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions the payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two options above the carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power cfd would support power market revenues for the plants renewable power output we first considered if committing to any of these business model options for beccs in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader ggr support scheme we assessed whether these options could over time be transitioned into a broader ggr support scheme ie one not just focused on beccs in power and concluded that this would be possible for all of them we then considered how these business model options could be funded and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds for example power cfds are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the low carbon contracts company lccc we concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options so the two decisions can be made independently this means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel we then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the beis consultation on business models for ccs summarised in the figure below figure 1 principles for design of business models instil investor confidence  attract innovation  attract new entrants  instil supply chain confidence cost efficiency  drive efficient management of investment costs  drive efficient quantity of investment  drive efficient dispatch and operation  risks allocated in an efficient way taking into account the impact on the cost of capital feasibility  limit administrative burden  practicality for investors  requirement for complementary policy  wider policy and state aid compatibility  timely implementation fair cost sharing  allows fair and practical cost distribution ease of policy transition  ease of transition to subsidy free system  ease of transition to technology neutral solution source frontier economics click to viewdownload graphic all three business model options performed well across most criteria however our evaluation highlighted some key tradeoffs to consider when choosing a business model investor confidence the power cfd and the twopart model with a cfd performed better than the carbon payment on this measure as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations feasibility the power cfd performed best on this measure because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood it will be quick to implement introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation however this will be needed in any case to support other ccus technologies 7  and could be introduced in time before projects come online and potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free all three options could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral however the standalone power cfd performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions overall the twopart model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world delivering learnings that will be relevant for other ggrs as well conclusions the uks net zero target will be challenging to achieve and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hardtoabate sectors as highlighted by the ccc 8  beccs in power is a particularly important part of this picture and represents a costeffective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed early investment in beccs is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of back ending significant abatement effort however market failures most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings and reliance on availability of ts infrastructure mean that without policy intervention the required level of beccs in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to net zero there are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers in our view a twopart model combining a power cfd and a carbon payment is preferable this measure addresses identified market failures can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early beccs in power investment and can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers including with reference to investors likely cost of capital and in a way that allocates risks appropriately viewdownload the full report pdf  1 biomass can be combusted to generate energy typically in the form of power but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel or gasified to produce hydrogen the resulting emissions can then be captured and stored using ccs technology the focus of this report is

will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 27 january 2021 opinion tackling climate change requires global collaboration as a ukus sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the united states and the rest of the world  a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green

what is electricity trading 29 december 2020 power generation what is electricity trading electricity trading is the process of power generators selling the electricity they generate to power suppliers who can then sell this electricity on to consumers the system operator  national grid eso in great britain  oversees the flow of electricity around the country and ensures the amounts traded will ultimately meet demand and do not overwhelm the power system who is involved in electricity trading there are three main parties in a power market generators  thermal power plants and energy storage sites  sources such as wind turbines and solar panels producing electricity consumers hospitals transport homes and factories using electricity and suppliers in the middle from whom you purchase electricity electricity is generated at power stations then bought by suppliers who then sell it on to meet the needs of the consumers electricity trading refers to the transaction between power generators who produce electricity and power suppliers who sell it on to consumers how are electricity contracts made electricity trading occurs in both long and shortterm time frames ranging from years in advance to deals covering the same day generation and supply must meet exact demand for every minute of the day which means that traders must always be ready to buy or sell power to fill any sudden gaps that arise when trading electricity far in advance factors such as exchange rates the cost and availability of fuel changing regulations and policies all affect the price shortterm price is more volatile and factors such as weather news events and even whats on television having the biggest impact on price traders analyse live generation data and news reports  to predict ahead of time how much electricity will be needed during periods of high demand and then determine a price traders then make offers and bids to suppliers and strike a deal  these deals then dictate how and when a power stations generators are run every day why is electricity trading important running a power station is an expensive process and demand for electricity never stops the electricity market ensures the countrys power demands are met while also aiming to keep electricity businesses sustainable through balancing the price of buying raw materials with the price at which electricity is sold to ensure the grid remains balanced and meets demand the systems operator also makes deals with generators for ancillary services  either far in advance or lastminute this ensures elements such as frequency voltage and reserve power are kept stable across the country and that the grid remains safe and efficient electricity trading ensures there is always a supply of power and that the market for electricity operates in a stable way electricity trading fast facts the history of modern electricity trading can be traced back to chile in 1980  when the country privatised its power industry this led to traders jostling to supply consumers with energy the uk was the first european nation to take up this model in 1990 electricity prices in the uk have actually occasionally gone negative  this happens when demand is low but weather conditions such as high winds or prolonged sunshine lead to an abundance of power ie through wind and solar generation this can lead to consumers being paid to use electricity  up to 4p per unit used  or to generators being paid to turn their output down or even switch off go deeper how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from how to calculate gas and electricity prices the night shift how a power station keeps the lights on when all the lights are off what is it that makes a countrys electricity system stable  in energy

prime minister chancellor cop26 president and minister for energy and clean growth we are a group of energy companies investing tens of billions in the coming decade deploying the low carbon infrastructure the uk will need to get to net zero and drive a green recovery to the covid19 crisis we welcome the leadership shown on the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and the detailed work going on across government to deliver a net zero economy by 2050 we are writing to you to call on the government to signal what this will mean for uk electricity decarbonisation by committing to a date for a net zero power system  head of beccs carl clayton inspects pipes at the ccus incubation area  drax power station the electricity sector will be the backbone of our net zero economy and there will be ever increasing periods where great britain is powered by only zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy wwwdraxcomcaptureit in the nearterm in combination with other policies continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation market dispatch of upcoming gasfired generation with carbon capture and storage ccs projects and the blending of low carbon hydrogen with gasfired generation further forward a robust carbon price can incentivise 100 hydrogen use in gasfired generation and importantly drive negative emissions to facilitate the delivery of a net zero economy next year the worlds attention will focus on glasgow and negotiations crucial to achieving our climate change targets with important commitments already made by china the eu japan and south korea amongst others an ambitious 2030 target from the uk will help kickstart the sprint to glasgow ahead of the ukun climate summit on 12 december electricity cables and pylon snaking around a mountain near cruachan power station  draxs flexible pumped storage facility in the highlands 2030 ambition is clearly needed but to deliver on net zero deep decarbonisation will be required previous commitments from the uk on its coal phase out and being the first major economy to adopt a net zero target continue to encourage similar international actions to build on these and continue uk leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation we call on the uk to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of cop26 to match the commitment of the us presidentelects clean energy plan  to ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input alongside nearterm stability as the uks carbon pricing future is determined to meet this commitment government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the budget next year with a target date to be confirmed in the uks upcoming net zero strategy this commitment would send a signal to the rest of the world that
