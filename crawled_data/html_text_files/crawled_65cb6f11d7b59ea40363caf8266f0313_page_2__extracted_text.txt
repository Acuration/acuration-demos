releases the robodog has joined draxs condition based maintenance team to spot potential failures on the plant before they happen the bright yellow dog is fitted with a camera which enables it to conduct critical visual and thermal inspections on equipment such as hot boilers while its human controllers are kept safe away from the equipment as sparky gets familiar with the plant he will be programmed to follow tailored routes around the site this will enable him to operate autonomously enhancing efficiency even further ensuring the safety health and wellbeing of people on site is the companys top priority draxs investment in sparky is part of a wider drive to improve safety standards across the companys global operations richard barber maintenance systems lead engineer said a robotic dog might not be what you have in mind when you think about safety but sparky is a real game changer for us the technology enables our team to collect better information about our equipment while also keeping our colleagues out of harms way its optical panoramic camera allows us to zoom indepth on equipment and it is fitted with a thermal infrared camera which means we can see any hot spot or unusual thermal anomalies on the machinery we want to prevent faults from happening not simply repair them when they occur with sparky on patrol at the power station we will be able to do just that sparky will have plenty of room to roam around with drax power station being one of the countrys largest industrial sites the plant near selby has four operational power generating units each as high as a 15storey office block a main chimney nearly as tall as the london shard and more than 1800 miles of steel tubing enough to stretch from john ogroats to lands end and back again the

19 september 2023 press releases the new funding will enable bathbased energy sparks to ensure that up to 240 schools across the uk have free access to its online energy management tool education programme and support services this includes schools in the areas of the country where drax group operates yorkshire and the humber east midlands east of england and scotland the charity currently works with more than 1000 uk schools to help them reduce their energy use and carbon footprint shona king head of community at drax group said we are proud that this new grant will help energy sparks engage many more schools and pupils across the uk in reducing their energy use and costs as well as fighting climate change alongside our existing grant funding for led lighting and solar panels we are excited to bring energy sparks energy analysis tool and education programme to more schools in and around the communities where we operate its important to us to help children start thinking about saving energy and reducing their carbon footprint from a young age as these issues are going to be increasingly important for them in the future dr claudia towner ceo and programme director at energy sparks said we are delighted to receive this funding from the drax foundation it means we can reach even more schools and pupils and remove financial barriers to ongoing engagement for some of the existing schools using our services our work equips children and young people with the knowledge skills and tools to take measurable action in their school and wider community to reduce carbon emissions we also enable school leaders staff and communities to better understand and reduce their schools energy consumption save money and introduce wider measures to reduce their carbon footprint energy sparks was founded in 2020 and in the last year through energy sparks tools the average primary school it works with has saved at least 3000 in energy costs and 128 tonnes of co2 additionally the average secondary school has saved at least 12000 and 48 tonnes of co2 energy sparks education activities encourage pupils to learn about climate change and why reducing carbon emissions is important investigating energy use around the school site taking action to reduce energy use and spreading the energy saving and carbon reduction message across their wider school community energy sparks online tool presents bespoke analysis of the energy data with suggestions of actions the school community could take to save energy and reduce the schools carbon emissions this new funding is drawn from a pot of 15m that drax foundation unveiled earlier this year for uk schools to install energyefficient led lights and solar panels and deliver energy saving monitoring and education ends

power station  education scottish energy minister calls on uk government to support new pumped storage hydro plants 16 august 2023 press releases mr gray gave his backing to the industry while visiting draxs iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station near oban in argyll where the renewable energy giant is progressing plans to build a new 500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at the site expanding the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid enhancing the nations energy security while tackling climate change pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it despite the critical need for them no new plants have been commissioned in the uk since 1984 with existing support schemes for other technologies unsuitable for the unique needs of these largescale infrastructure projects a report by kpmg found that a cap and floor mechanism like the regime used to incentivise investment in crossborder interconnectors could overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said to achieve a safe and secure net zero power grid we need to have a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants to balance our grid as the uk increasingly relies on intermittent renewables to keep our lights on there is a growing need for flexible power sources to plug the gap when the wind doesnt blow or the sun doesnt shine with its reversible turbines cruachan can also store excess power from scotlands wind turbines when they are generating more renewable electricity than we need helping to stop valuable green power from going to waste with the right support from the uk government drax will invest 500m to more than double cruachans generating capacity and support almost 1000 jobs across the supply chain during construction scottish government energy secretary neil gray msp said scotland is a global leader in the production of renewable energy which will play an increasingly important role in the transition to a net zero electricity system by 2045 however pumped hydro storage an important low carbon technology is currently ineligible for uk government support uk government inaction on this issue represents a significant obstacle to progress and risks failing to secure economic benefits such as creating thousands of good quality green jobs earlier this year a report commissioned by the influential trade body scottish renewables found that a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants in scotland could create almost 15000 jobs across the uk with draxs cruachan expansion generating almost half a billion pounds for the uk economy drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation ends media contacts aidan kerr senior media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes drax applied for development consent from the scottish government under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 in may 2022 the plans received consent through the section 36 process in july 2023 the uk government has pledged to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in largescale longduration storage projects by 2024 a report by kpmg for drax found that a cap  floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently no investment decision has yet been taken by drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other
