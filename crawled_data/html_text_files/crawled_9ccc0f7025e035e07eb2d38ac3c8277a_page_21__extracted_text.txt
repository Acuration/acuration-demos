investors annual report and accounts 2016 smart energy solutions  qa 10 march 2017 annual report view the drax group plc annual report and accounts q do you think performance got better or worse in 2016 a financially ebitda was in line with our guidance although below 2015 this principally reflects very challenging commodity markets and the removal of the climate change levy exemption we were able to partly offset the impact of these factors with a focus on flexible system support in the prompt and balancing markets ancillary services and improving retail profitability all of which are important parts of our strategy to develop broader noncommodity exposed earnings operationally 2016 was another good year across our business but particularly in generation where the team completed a significant outage programme and on the regulatory front the european commissions approval of the cfd meant we could complete the final stages of the upgrade to our third biomass unit q what were the most significant changes for the group in 2016 a the most important change was the new group strategy which gives us all a very clear direction for the future and will see drax become a broader business across our markets  pellet supply generation and retail  the acquisition of opus energy will strengthen our retail offer and our plans to build four rapid response gas power stations will plug the gaps at times of system stress the new group strategy is underpinned by new people and it strategies which are crucial to its successful delivery haven power has also seen significant change with the arrival of ceo jonathan kini he along with his team have been working to ensure we are well placed to continue growing and to boost our retail offer with the recent acquisition of opus q how do you think 2017 will be different to 2016 a the focus will be on continuing to deliver good performance right across the group but there will also be changes as we work closely with the opus team to ensure we create the best possible retail offer for the uks smes drax power will be progressing the ocgt gas projects  and it will be an exciting year for drax biomass as they look to secure acquisitions of pellet mills and opportunities to export compressed word pellets to other markets everyone across the group will see further evidence of the new strategy rollout particularly in the form of the people and it strategies q how does diversifying into gas fit with your aim to replace coal with renewable generation at drax a it complements it perfectly the european commissions approval of the cfd enabled us to complete the upgrade of half the power station to run on compressed wood pellets in place of coal and in 2016 65 of the electricity we generated at drax was renewable  the job is not yet done and with the right conditions we will upgrade the remaining coal units we can do this in just two to three years  when the conditions are right the planned gas power stations will not be run to produce baseload power but as rapid response units to plug the gaps at times of system stress for example when wind and solar fail to contribute whats required they will also be part of a solution that can accelerate the end of coal in the uk  q can you explain the acquisition of opus wouldnt it have made more sense to grow haven a we acquired haven in 2009 when it was an sme focused business since then the business has grown significantly by principally focusing on the ic market to provide a route to market for around half the electricity drax power produces although it retains a relatively small sme presence opus  like haven  is a challenger business and brings with it 265000 customer metered sites largely smes opus also supplies gas  which for the first time will see us having the ability to provide a dual fuel offer something that is vital for many smes opus gives us immediate scale in the sme market and we think the complementary nature of the haven and opus models can provide a compelling challenger retail proposition for our customers q have you got the right team and systems in place to ensure that opus will join the group with minimal disruption a yes jonathan kini  who leads our retail business has a great depth of experience in sme markets and integration he has strengthened his team to ensure we have the expertise required to make this a very successful transition as opus becomes a member of the drax family however im in no way complacent about the challenges thats why we developed a plan to embed opus covering everything from it to communications its vital we get this right and that our new colleagues become part of delivering our new group strategy and share in our values clearly i also want both haven and opus customers to continue experiencing high levels of service along with the benefits of a more comprehensive retail offer q how is drax power different to when you joined a in many ways drax is now a very different place to what it was when i joined drax more than ten years ago the fact that in 2016 65 of our output was renewable is something im very proud of and right across the power station you can actually see the difference that using compressed wood pellets has made huge storage domes  specially designed train wagons  and a visitor centre and guides explaining the latest chapter in the drax story essentially today the power station operates as two power stations a reliable flexible renewable generator producing electricity for businesses and homes and a fossil fuel generator providing system support and security of supply q you have highlighted the role that drax coal units can play in system support and ancillary services  what is this and why is it important a increasing levels of intermittent renewables and inflexible nuclear present the grid with a challenge and for drax opportunities when the grid needs capacity our coal units have the flexibility to turn on and off and ramp up and down responding to demand as weather and time of day determine the availability of wind and solar it is already common place for drax to twoshift the coal units using them to provide flexible responsive power rather than baseload but its not just about generation  a wellfunctioning grid needs other services too 2017 will see drax seeking further opportunities to provide the electricity grid with this increasingly important system support q did the result of the uks eu referendum have any impact on the business a our business model is largely unaffected by the decision to leave the eu we will continue to generate and sell power in the uk we purchase a significant amount of the fuel we require in foreign currency and our longterm hedging strategy  five years ahead  has protected us against any negative impacts of exchange rate fluctuations for the mediumterm q has the change in the uk government resulted in any different signals being sent out to the renewables sector a i think that still remains to be seen we have to look at the huge changes that have happened in government since the eu referendum as a potential opportunity for us as we continue to make the case for investment in further biomass upgrades what is clear is that the focus is still very much on affordable energy  in 2016 imperial college london and the economic consultancy nera published new research that we commissioned it showed that when whole system costs are factored in biomass is the cheapest large scale renewable technology if government applied this method of support to future cfd auctions consumers could benefit by up to 22 billion as we take forward our new strategy we will also be clearly communicating our plans for rapid response gas power stations and how the system support they will provide contributes to decarbonising the uks energy system q what are the latest plans to convert the remaining generating units that run on coal a we have now delivered on our original strategy to upgrade three generating units to run on compressed wood pellets however we would like to do more and have consistently said that with the right conditions we stand ready to convert further units the transformation weve been through has meant weve learnt a huge amount over the last few years and theres no doubt that for future upgrades we can carry them out quicker and more costeffectively q why do you think questions around the sustainability of biomass continue to be raised a i think many companies involved in the sourcing and supply of sustainable products will face questions in this area what we will do is continue to be open and honest about all aspects of how our business operates including sustainability  much of that evidence can be seen in this annual report  from our own stringent sustainability policy  to how we comply with the uk governments sustainability legislation criteria  however we are never complacent and for example each new pellet supplier to drax is fully and independently audited before a contract is signed and our existing suppliers are audited at least once every three years q which other business roles do you have outside of drax and how do they help the group a im a nonexecutive director at the eaton corporation and also the court of the bank of england i think its important to have roles outside the business as long as they allow you to get the balance right and these do so clearly they should in no way be a distraction from the day job but worth an investment of time that allows you to see how others operate and whether there are lessons that we can learn or best practice that we can adopt q whats the feeling around the board table a id say its one of excitement at the opportunities our new group strategy and acquisitions present for the future while theres obviously satisfaction that weve delivered on what we initially set out to do  upgrade three generating units to run on compressed wood pellets there is certainly no feeling of job done in the months ahead the board will rightly want to see clear and positive progress as we work to boost our retail offer through opus energy and develop our plans to build four

entered into a binding conditional agreement with the shareholders of opus energy the sellers for the purchase of opus energy for 340 million payable in cash on completion 3  completion of the acquisition is conditional on amongst other things the approval of draxs shareholders and the approval by the european commission of the cfd investment contract 2 awarded to drax by the uk government drax remains confident of approval of the cfd investment contract a circular is expected to be sent to shareholders in early 2017 convening a general meeting to vote on the acquisition completion of the acquisition is also expected to occur in early 2017 background to and reasons for the proposed acquisition the drax board of directors believes that the proposed acquisition provides a unique opportunity and is strategically and financially compelling opus energy will enhance draxs retail offering by combining the leading challenger small and medium enterprise sme business with haven powers strength in the industrial and commercial ic market the combination provides a robust platform for growth combining draxs and haven powers commercial capabilities and vertically integrated business model with opus energys established sme business and experience in both electricity and gas the acquisition leverages draxs flexible reliable renewable generation offering to create energy solutions for customers it also furthers draxs strategic ambition to diversify and improve the quality of its earnings whilst increasing the contribution of businesses with longterm growth opportunities key benefits of the acquisition acceleration of draxs retail strategy the acquisition provides access to a large and profitable sme focused retail business as the leading challenger brand in the sme market opus energy has demonstrated consistent sales and sustained growth in revenue and profitability 7 driven by customer satisfaction and high customer retention levels 85 april 2015 to june 2016 as at 31 march 2016 opus energy had a total of 129025 customers with 265418 meters and as at 30 april 2016 had a nondomestic electricity market share of 8 by meters count opus energys experience and proven success in the sme market combined with haven powers existing presence in the ic market represents an exceptional opportunity for drax to develop a platform for the growth of its retail business and significantly expand its customer base in the profitable sme sector accelerating the implementation of draxs retail growth strategy platform for growth over the last six years opus energy has trebled the number of meters contracted to 265418 as at 31 march 2016 and has driven profitability through its low cost business model and strong customer service proposition the acquisition provides the combined drax and opus energy groups the enlarged group with established routes to market for electricity and gas in the sme market and drax believes that the combination of opus energy and haven power can drive market share growth the sme market covers a broad range of customers  at the large end commercial users similar to ic customers whilst at the smaller end users similar to domestic customers the expertise and platforms shared by the combined business across both ic and sme markets will enable the enlarged group to deliver new products and services and enhanced market coverage compatible and complementary to existing retail business haven power was acquired by drax in 2009 as a credit efficient route to market for the large volumes of electricity produced by drax power and to monetise electricity sales and renewable certificates such as renewables obligation certificates rocs haven power has focused on growing market share in the ic market and currently has limited presence in the sme market where opus is well established the acquisition therefore complements haven power with its focus on a profitable separate and distinct customer segment it will also enlarge the route to market for draxs generation business and allow its retail business to achieve critical mass both in the nondomestic market and within the drax group opus energys expertise in sme electricity and gas sales combined with haven powers track record in the ic market and draxs umbrella of generationbacked power and commodity risk management is anticipated to provide distinct benefits in the future including the opportunity for an alternative hedge to commodity market exposure drax believes that opus energys expertise in different but related markets a challenger mentality and a shared customer service ethos with haven power together with its strong credit and risk management including commodity risk makes opus energy a good cultural fit with drax and contributes to the uniqueness of the acquisition opportunity haven ye dec 2015 opus ye mar 2016 proforma revenues m 1290 573 1863 gross profit m 19 107 126 gross profit margin 1 19 customer meters

manage its exposure to commodity and power markets by broadening the range of markets in which it operates with improvements in magnitude and stability of net income the acquisition aligns with this strategy and is expected to deliver more broadly based high quality and predictable earnings today and in the longterm this will be driven by more revenue from electricity and gas sales in the sme market and opus energys high levels of customer retention 85 in april 2015 to june 2016 attractive financial returns opus energy is expected to deliver strongly enhanced margins to draxs retail business having experienced consistent midsingle digit ebit margins over the last three financial years opus energy is focussed on small sme and multisite corporate groups obtained via an extensive network of third party intermediaries tpis and is supported by a specialist customer service department the utilisation of tpis has helped to increase opus energys customer base and has established a broad sales network incentivised to maximise margin together with a simplified pricing model and quick customer revenue collection opus energy delivers significantly higher net margins per customer than those currently achieved by haven power in the higher volume low margin ic sector in addition over the last three financial years the difference between opus energys ebit and ebitda has remained consistently low reflecting the low capital intensity of its business the acquisition is expected to add both short and longterm financial benefits to drax drax expects to achieve a return on invested capital higher than its current cost of capital the addition of the wellestablished and growing opus energy business with its high profitability and high cash conversion is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings and cash flow in 2017 with opus energy having delivered reported ebitda of 337 million ebit of 328 million and cash from operations of 343 million in the financial year ended 31 march 2016 synergy potential the principal synergy will be the opportunity to benefit from the sourcing of wholesale electricity and gas from drax power over the past three years the costs associated with wholesale energy purchasing have been approximately 6 million per year by bringing these into the drax group drax expects to eliminate the majority of this cost following completion of the acquisition and replacement of these wholesale energy purchasing agreements the majority of opus energys power and gas wholesale supply requirements for new customers will be provided by drax power drax also expects the consolidation of commodity positions within the enlarged group to achieve some economies of scale opus energys capability within the gas market will give haven the ability to satisfy the increasing demand for dual supply from customers in haven target market at the smaller end of the size range the acquisition will also allow drax to drive traditional operational efficiencies over time opus energys it platform is expected to be able to absorb forecasted customer growth in the immediate future allowing drax the time and flexibility to create a sustainable it platform solution for the enlarged group in the medium term information on opus energy overview founded in 2002 opus energy is a business to business supplier of electricity gas and related services in the uk employing c870 people across northampton oxford and cardiff  by number of customers opus energy is the uks largest nondomestic energy supplier outside of the big 6 with an

external channels such as direct marketing and tpis in the financial year ended 31 march 2016 opus energy supplied 21 twh to 124552 electricity meters and 17 twh to 44591 gas meters belonging to small sme customers for the financial year ended 31 march 2016 small sme sales generated turnover of 323 million corporate opus energy offers fixed and flexible products to a wide range of corporate electricity and gas customers in the financial year ended 31 march 2016 opus energy supplied 19 twh to 96275 corporate meters belonging to around 3500 corporate customers comprised of both large and small companies for the financial year ended 31 march 2016 corporate sales generated turnover of 214 million corporate distribution channels are similar to the channels used for smes although greater reliance is placed on tpis with opus energy receiving corporate customer business from over 160 tpis renewables approximately 20 of electricity sourced by opus energy comes from small to midsized embedded renewable electricity generators such generators include wind turbines solar hydro and anaerobic digestion as at 31 march 2016 2197 meters relating to 483mw of export capacity were registered to opus energy for the financial year ended 31 march 2016 purchases of renewable generation totalled 59 million supply all of the gas and approximately 80 of the electricity sold by opus energy is sourced from wholesale supply agreements the remainder of the electricity is purchased from the small to midsized renewable energy generators described above it is intended that the wholesale energy purchase agreements will be replaced with arrangements to source electricity and gas through drax power while the existing arrangements with renewable generators will be retained operational metrics

lead draxs retail business including opus energy and represent it at draxs executive committee level there will not be any changes to the drax board of directors following the acquisition current trading and outlook opus energy has continued to achieve strong growth in the number of meters supplied since 31 march 2016 electricity meter numbers exceeded 243000 by 31 october 2016 a 15 increase since the end of october 2015 with gas meters up by 29 to over 52000 resulting in a total meter count exceeding 295000 volumes supplied to customers in the first seven months of the financial year were also significantly up 17 in electricity and 22 in gas the average prices charged to customers over the period decreased as a result of lower commodity prices 3 reduction in average electricity price and 5 lower gas prices the combination of these factors has resulted in turnover for the first seven months of the financial year of 337 million which was 13 higher than the same period in 2015 in addition it is expected that ebit for the year ending 31 march 2017 will be generally in line with ebit for the year ended 31 march 2016 summary of the principal terms of the acquisition drax group plc drax group holdings limited drax group holdings and drax developments limited drax developments entered into an acquisition agreement the acquisition agreement with the sellers on 6 december 2016 in relation to the acquisition of opus energy for 340 million as part of the transaction a locked box mechanism has been agreed from 31 march 2016 to the date of completion of the acquisition this has the effect that economic ownership of opus energy and all profits earned passing to drax developments as at 31 march 2016 by preventing cash and cash equivalents being paid out of opus energy to the sellers or persons connected to them other than certain items agreed in the acquisition agreement including the dividend paid in april 2016 to compensate the sellers for this locked box interest of 8 per annum prorated for the actual period between 31 march 2016 and completion of the acquisition will be paid to the sellers at completion of the acquisition as at 31 march 2016 opus energy had net debt of 3 million following completion of the acquisition it is expected that the existing debt facilities of opus energy will be repaid and cancelled and any working capital requirements of opus using debt facilities and existing cash of the enlarged group the acquisition is expected to complete in q1 2017 the acquisition is conditional upon the approval by the european commission of the cfd investment contract awarded to drax by the uk government drax remains confident of approval of the cfd investment contract 2  the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules and the uk competitions and markets authority the cma not having made an order or a reference under the uk merger control regime such that the acquisition is prohibited from completing whilst the cma completes an investigation drax group holdings has agreed to guarantee the obligations of drax developments under the acquisition agreement certain of the sellers have given to drax developments customary warranties relating to opus energys business and warranties and covenants relating to opus energys tax position drax developments intends to arrange a warranty and indemnity insurance policy to provide cover up to 50 million in respect of those warranties and covenants subject to certain exceptions and limitations financing of the acquisition the consideration in respect of the acquisition will be financed entirely by a new acquisition debt facility of up to 375 million drax aims to maintain a credit rating in the bb range in line with its robust subinvestment grade business model this is consistent with the recent update from sp which reconfirmed the existing rating drax will consider potential options for its longterm financing strategy in 2017 integration drax is developing a detailed integration plan to combine opus energy into the enlarged group ocgt developments drax developments has entered into an agreement with watt power limited a developer of ocgt assets to acquire four 299mw ocgt development projects 1 ocgts are gasfired power plants that can be used by drax to provide flexible support to the electricity system to make up any shortfall in generation two of these projects are in an advanced stage of development and will participate in the 2016 t4 capacity market auction which begins today if either of these projects are awarded a capacity contract in this auction they will commence operations by 2020 supported by a 15 year capacity contract providing a very high level of base revenue certainty until at least 2035 this is consistent with draxs strategy to improve the quality of its earnings and deliver targeted longterm growth the other two projects require further development in anticipation of their targeted participation in the 2019 t4 capacity market auction the initial purchase price for all four developments is 185 million with the total consideration payable dependent on the clearing price in future capacity market auctions 4  the current total gross asset value of these assets is 73 million and as they are development assets there are currently no profits attributable to the assets the consideration will be funded from existing cash and assuming full development the investment in each project is currently expected to be in the range of 80 million to 100 million trading and operational performance since publishing its half year results on 26 july trading conditions in the markets in which drax operates have improved with higher power and commodity prices draxs second major planned biomass unit outage was completed over the summer the outage commenced earlier than planned due to a generator issue but has now been completed with no biomass related issues identified both biomass and coal operations are currently performing well although availability of biomass units over the period has been lower than forecast due to the generator issue noted above and an unplanned outage on fuel feed systems as noted above the cfd investment contract 2 awarded by the uk government remains subject to approval by the european commission and drax remains confident of approval of this contract taking these factors into account amongst others based on the current power prices and good operational availability for the remainder of the year alongside cfd revenues during december drax continues to expect full year ebitda 5 to be around the bottom of the range of current analyst forecasts 6  power sales contracted for 2016 and 2017 as at 28 november 2016 the power sales contracted for 2016 and 2017 were as follows 2016 2017 power sales twh comprising 189 149  fixed price power sales twh 189 132 at an average

generation to avoid an investment hiatus in the renewables sector before cfds become available under the enduring regime the government introduced a scheme for investment contracts under the final investment decision enabling fid enabling for renewables mechanism these were early cfds intended to provide greater confidence for investors in advance of the enduring cfd 3 as part of the locked box mechanism additional interest of 8 per annum prorated for the actual period between 31 march 2016 and completion of the acquisition will be paid to the sellers at completion of the acquisition 4 the range of consideration payable for the four assets is 185 million to 905 million dependent on the capacity market auction clearing price with the top of this range being associated with a capacity market clearing at 75kw the current 2016 auction price cap however the t4 auctions in 2014 and 2015 cleared towards the low end of the range of expectations at 1940kw and 180kw respectively 5 ebitda is defined as profit before interest tax depreciation including asset obsolescence charges and gains and losses on asset disposals amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 6 based on a range of market forecasts for ebitda published since 26 july 2016 of 135 million to 169 million these forecasts generally assume a cfd investment contract for draxs third biomass unit conversion with a strike price of 100mwh 2012 terms by january 2017 7 excluding a reduction in the financial year ended 31 march 2016 reflecting the removal of the climate change levy exemption for renewable power 8 structured power sales and equivalents include forward gas sales providing additional liquidity for forward sales highly correlated to the power market and acting as a substitute for forward power sales this announcement contains inside information end tags gas  investors the new renewable energy directive and what it means for biomass 29 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy this story was published the day before the announcement by the european commission please scroll to the bottom of this page for the drax view  when the european union set out its policy for the promotion of renewable energy in the 2009 renewable energy directive red it set a very ambitious target by 2020 renewables should make up 20 of the eus energy consumption each member state was given a specific goal and made to detail exactly how it would hit this the directive was comprehensive in many ways but it didnt include a clear sustainability policy for solid biomass including compressed wood pellets  as one of the largest sources of renewable energy in europe  this left a policy gap that many voices  including drax  have called to be filled its a wish that will now be granted a revised red is set to be published by the eu that will specify clear criteria for all biomass sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy but drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way dorothy thompson drax group ceo july 2014 importance of sustainable biomass biomass is a wellestablished and essential part of the renewable energy mix it offers a unique mix of reliability flexibility and affordability all while helping to deliver carbon reductions this makes it particularly important as countries like the uk seek to phase out coal generation and hit the targets set out in the paris agreement however in order to secure these carbon benefits biomass needs to be produced sustainably this means that it comes from responsiblymanaged growing forests and that the emissions from the supply chain are measured and minimised in the uk there are already binding sustainability criteria but this isnt the case across the eu biomass use in the uk is regulated under the eu timber regulations and uks own renewable obligation ro biomass sustainability criteria the ro is a form of government support designed to incentivise large scale renewable electricity generation in the uk and to qualify for this energy companies must adhere to sustainability standards such as properly accounting for their greenhouse gas ghg emissions and only sourcing from responsibly managed land and forests  an euwide approach to biomass that follows the uks could see the implementation of a riskbased scheme that asks large energy companies to prove how they mitigate against a set of identified risks  like those in the ro criteria however its important that compliance with these is independently verified  something that could be done by using independent schemes such as the sustainable biomass program sbp the sbp carries out supplybase evaluation of pellet producers to ensure the wood theyre using is qualified as sustainable and theyre meeting the ro criteria programmes like the sbp are already being used by most major biomass power generators in the eu and could act as a blueprint for the future efficiency where effective only a few of the power stations across the eu are suitable for conversion from coal to biomass but those that are like drax can deliver fast significant carbon savings the thermal efficiency of such stations may not be as high as a newly built plant but they do allow governments to quickly move away from coal more than that these plants can continue to provide the critical services  such as voltage control and black start  the grid needs to remain stable and that other renewables cant drax is one of these stations and in the first half of 2016 it was able to deliver around 20 of the uks renewable power thanks to its conversion to biomass it now does this with over 80 carbon reductions relative to coal with the abundance of suitable and sustainablygrown fibre that can be used for biomass electricity generation there is a strong case for the eu to encourage the coal phase out by encouraging others to undergo conversion from coal to biomass but whats also needed is a clear set of sustainability criteria for biomass  the move to define this is a step in the right direction but the final eu proposal needs to be a practical one if the updated red achieves this it will mean a bright future for renewable energy in europe and a clearer path for meeting the continents paris agreement targets  30 november 2016 update  drax welcomes renewable energy directive proposal drax welcomes the publication of the renewable energy directive and bioenergy policy proposal  drax has been at the forefront of calling for standards based on a riskassessment to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass used for energy production matt willey public affairs director of drax power had said that drax has campaigned for a robust pragmatic biomass sustainability policy for the whole eu for many years and today is a step in the right direction it is important that large users of biomass can demonstrate forest regeneration is taking place that areas of high conservation value are protected that soil and water quality is maintained and that harvesting does not exceed the longterm production capacity of the forest we welcome the fact the commission proposes that voluntary national or international schemes including those which use a risk based approach can be used to provide evidence of sustainability the uk already has the toughest sustainability rules in the world so drax can be sure our compressed wood pellets are sustainable but it makes sense to have a common policy across the eu drax power has made huge efforts to demonstrate the sustainability of its biomass  sourcing from regions with large surpluses combined with low wood paying capability drax is able to track and trace every shipment back to low risk areas which assures that biodiversity is protected
