solar power with storage battery 11 november 2018 press releases the low carbon pilot project will see local farmer sue harrison working in partnership with power firm opus energy to test the new technology which has just been installed at familyrun home farm in braunston northamptonshire solar panels on the cattle shed at the farm which produces aberdeen angus beef as well as lamb currently provide power to the farmhouse and the marquee from which they run their successful wedding business which is already fully booked until 2020 as the 50 kw panels generate more power than is consumed by the farm the extra electricity is exported to the national grid and sue and her family are paid for it by opus energy through a power purchase agreement ppa  known as  prosuming  experts at opus energy say the new battery technology being trialled at home farm if successful could open up revenue streams for businesses as it would allow excess electricity to be stored and then sold back to the grid when it is needed the most therefore commanding a higher price jonathan kini chief executive of drax retail which provides power to smaller businesses through opus energy as well as to larger companies through haven power said the pilot is one of a number of innovative low carbon schemes being looked at by the energy supplier we know customers and businesses are keen to embrace sustainability wherever they can and were keen to help jonathan commented its early days for this project well need to see how it develops now its installed at home farm but if its successful this could provide opportunities for more and more businesses in the future to take control generate their own energy and choose when they sell it to the grid to provide another revenue stream the electricity industry is changing quickly and increasing digitalisation will help customers save money as they learn to use less help us move to greener lowercarbon energy sources and also see the rise of prosumers like sue and her family were really grateful to the home farm team for agreeing to take part in this trial sue whose family have been farming in braunston for over 60 years and launched the wedding business in 2015 said im really proud of the way our business has developed but im also keen to leave my children and even grandchildren a business which is genuinely sustainable weve been on a ppa since 2012 but if this means we get more control of when we sell the energy we produce and dont need and make a little more money for the business then thats got to be worth doing more and more wedding customers are looking for sustainable greener venues and it would be great to able to showcase our credentials through innovations like this to future customers if successful batteries similar to the one installed at home farm for the trial could be available to other customers ends media contact mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email protected t 01484 968238 m 07969 080272

protected capacity from renewables has overtaken fossil fuels 6 november 2018 press releases a major green milestone has been reached on britains electricity grid as the total capacity available from renewables has overtaken fossil fuels for the first time according to the latest drax electric insights report  a third of fossil fuel generating capacity has retired over the last five years  whilst the capacity from wind solar biomass hydro and other renewables has tripled taking the total renewable capacity available on the system to 42gw this means that for the first time renewables have the biggest share of britains electricity generating infrastructure overtaking the 406gw of capacity available from fossil fuels wind farms provide the biggest share of renewable capacity on the system with more than 20gw available solar comes in second providing more than 13gw biomass is third with 32gw biomass played an important role in helping to tip the balance from fossil fuels to renewables with two coaltobiomass conversions being completed during the third quarter of the year at lynemouth in northumberland and drax power stations unit 4 conversion in yorkshire  adding 1gw of capacity in total the growth in offshore wind power has made britain the worlds leader with 45 of global wind capacity stationed here  and so far this year galloper rampion race bank and walney 3 have all come online making walney the worlds largest offshore wind farm at 066gw there are almost a million rooftop solar power systems in operation across britain contributing to the 13gw of capacity available the electric insights report produced independently by researchers from imperial college london for drax also looks at why power prices are at a tenyear high and identifies brexit as being a major factor an 18 increase in power costs was caused by the currency devaluation associated with the 2016 referendum result when the gb pound fell against the euro and us dollar however balancing the power system also added six per cent to wholesale prices as the daytoday costs of running the transmission system came in at 38m per day during the third quarter of 2018 dr iain staffell from imperial explained the cost of balancing the system has doubled in the last four years the amount of flexible generation on the system is a key driver balancing costs rise when the output from flexible generators such as gas coal biomass and hydro falls below 10gw having a brittle power system with limited flexibility will be more expensive to control more flexible generation storage and demandside response will be critical in minimising system costs in the future andy koss drax power ceo said more renewables are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and helping us to meet our climate targets  but flexible lower carbon generation is also clearly vital for controlling the costs of maintaining a stable low carbon power system the ipccs report recognised that in order to meet our climate change targets up to 85 of global power generation needs to come from renewables by 2050 this means the remainder will have to be provided by flexible sources which can support the system and help to keep costs down  such as biomass hydro pumped storage as well as high efficiency gas ends media contacts ali lewis drax group interim head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07712677177 notes to editors the growing costs of balancing the power system highlight the importance of when and where  rather than just how much  electricity is produced and consumed over the quarter there were 58 hours when managing electricity flows around the system cost more than generating the electricity in the first place during september the balancing costs spiked several times when wind output was high wind cannot be forecasted with perfect accuracy and generation occurs far from places where electricity is consumed causing network constraints both of these must be corrected using shortterm dispatch of flexible sources which incurs balancing costs  balancing costs include deploying fastresponding generators for backup and reserve  and adjusting the output of generators around the country to keep the transmission system within operating limits about electric insights electric insights quarterly was commissioned by

350acre nature reserve which forms part of the drax site near selby in the summer  and the busy insects have already produced enough honey to fill 350 jars with more expected next year the latest nature project to take place on the barlow mound reserve which forms part of the drax power station site saw west yorkshirebased businessman chris holmes move the 24 hives into place in july as an initial trial he has seen immediate success with 300lbs of barlow mound honey already produced chris who set up his business stickeys in 2008 will now maintain the colonies over the winter ready for next year when the bee population in the two dozen hives is expected to grow to more than a million and produce up to 2000 jars of the sticky breakfast favourite barlow mound was developed at drax from the early 1970s and has become a major nature reserve in the area home to a variety of wildlife and plant life and a valuable educational resource for schools colleges and local nature groups the bees live on the reserve just a few hundred yards from the power station which is the biggest renewable power producer in the country and the largest decarbonisation project in europe producing enough renewable electricity to power around four million homes and the honey they have produced has already received the thumbs up for taste from staff at drax including andrew christian whose role at the power plant includes managing the barlow mound reserve and who worked with chris on introducing the bees im really proud that weve managed to bring the bees in and help enhance the ecology of the nature reserve still further its just one more way in which were able to keep developing barlow mound and to get something as tasty as this as a result is a bonus said andrew who has already bought some of the honey for his own breakfasts working closely with our ecologists were always looking for new ways to improve the biodiversity of the site and we thought that bees would be a great idea chris came highly recommended to us and its been a great success so far its one more way to show that theres more to drax and the honey is absolutely delicious chris who runs his business from his home in flockton near wakefield said you might not expect a power station to be somewhere where bees would live but the site is absolutely perfect barlow mound has got all the plants and pollen that honey bees need and its just an ideal location for them to thrive its also a secure site which means the bees are safe and will be left alone to do their own thing which is also important and drax have been brilliant in helping me to get this established its now heading into winter so the bees wont be producing any more honey until next year but when they do im hoping it will be a really productive site for us i hope this will be the start of us producing honey at drax for many years to come each of the 24 colonies will be home to up to 50000 bees when fully established with each hive producing an expected 60lbs of honey a year though that amount could increase or decrease depending on the weather conditions the bees site overlooks the power station which recently converted the fourth of its six generating units from coal to running on renewable biomass it has plans to repower its two remaining coal units to use gas and be off coal ahead of the governments 2025 deadline drax

ensuring an end to the use of coal in the power system helping us to further decarbonise costeffectively and cementing the uks leading role in tackling climate change we welcome the governments acknowledgment that the carbon price must remain high enough to keep coal off the uk system beyond 2021 the carbon price should be set at the right level to prevent a resurgence in coal generation before 2025 us ambassador visits uks biggest power station 26 october 2018 press releases mr johnson the ambassador of the united states of america to the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland had a tour of the power station and heard about how drax upgraded two thirds of its generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe around 60 per cent of the biomass used by drax to produce enough renewable electricity for four million households comes from the sustainable working forests of the us south  making it the biggest importer of us agricultural products drax also operates three pellet plants in the us south which produce biomass for the power station in north yorkshire mr johnson met with drax group ceo will gardiner and drax power ceo andy koss to hear about the transformation of the power station and their plans for the future he heard about their plans for a bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot project  due to get underway this autumn which if successful could enable the power produced at drax to become carbon negative  making a vital contribution to efforts to tackle climate change they also outlined proposals to repower the two remaining coal units to use gas and develop up to 200mw of battery storage as well as the proposed 702 million acquisition of some of scottish powers flexible and renewable power generation assets including pumped storage and hydro  which drax announced recently mr johnson said being here at drax has been fascinating  the scale of the place is incredible and the innovative projects and new technology being trialled here are very exciting drax makes a really important contribution to the us economy  i am pleased to be here to mark the important investment they make will gardiner drax group ceo said we are delighted to welcome the ambassador to drax power station to celebrate the successful transatlantic relationship between drax and the us which plays a vital role in enabling us to source the biomass needed to produce enough flexible renewable power for millions of homes and businesses in the uk we play a valuable role in the communities where we operate in the us creating jobs and breathing new life into areas previously affected by industrial decline since the acquisition of a third pellet mill we now employ almost 250 people over there with plans to grow our selfsupply of biomass so were producing up to 30 of the pellets used at the power station lr drax power ceo andy koss ambassador johnson drax group ceo will gardiner and stan phillips agricultural counselor andy koss drax power ceo added one of the biggest challenges we had when we converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal was in creating a completely new global supply chain for biomass we invested around 700m in new infrastructure both here at the power station but also in the pellet mills we own and the port

a cv attractive to future employers during workshops with students at sheffield university and spoke to students at leeds beckett university at its graduate and placements fair the final year students also discussed the importance of stem science technology engineering and maths skills in finding work when they graduate they also learned about potential opportunities for them to work as a year in industry student or as a graduate at drax  the uks biggest renewable power generator and the biggest decarbonisation project in europe resourcing specialist shelley lawton from draxs hr team who delivered the sessions for the students said she was impressed by how enthusiastic they were about the future adding we got some really good questions from the students about how they can stand out when applying for jobs which is obviously something on all students minds as their courses end it can be a big scary world out there when you have to go out and find a job we advised the students to be selective to focus on the quality of their applications not quantity and to apply for the jobs they really want by explaining why they want the role hopefully their passion and their personalities will shine through she added that students were interested in engineering roles with drax but also in a range of other roles in the company which recently announced the acquisition of 702m worth of flexible and renewable power generation assets from scottish power including pumped storage and hydro andy koss drax power ceo said engineering excellence has been key to drax power stations transformation into europes biggest decarbonisation project but our proposed expansion into new forms of generation such as pumped storage and hydro power means our requirement for highly skilled stem graduates is only likely to increase taking part in these events at the brilliant universities in sheffield and leeds is all part of our longterm commitment to skills development every business in the northern powerhouse region has a role to play in creating opportunities for young people reaching out to our communities and raising aspirations  encouraging them to develop the skills theyll need in the future we have worldclass engineers in the north now but we need to do more to ensure the next generation has the right education and skills particularly in science technology engineering and maths stem to carry on that legacy nine engineering apprentices began their careers at the selbybased power station in september a 50 increase on last years intake as drax continues to invest in and promote stem skills the energy firm also sponsors a number of phds at sheffield university producing cuttingedge research into area such as the impact of human behaviour on vehicle to grid
