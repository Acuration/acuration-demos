taxing coal off the system researchers at imperial college london modelled the electricity sector in 2016 with no carbon tax  and double the current levy read how they used electric insights data to help explore postbudget policy options 13 march 2017 power generation in the spring budget 2017 the chancellor announced that the government remains committed to carbon pricing philip hammonds red book revealed that from 202122 the government will target a total carbon price and set the specific tax rate  giving businesses greater clarity on the total price they will pay further details on carbon prices are to be set out at autumn budget 2017 researchers at imperial college london have modelled what would have happened during 2016 with no carbon tax and also with an increased carbon tax they have compared both with what actually happened their conclusion no carbon tax would mean more coal less gas higher emissions a higher carbon tax would mean less coal more gas lower emissions since it was announced in 2011 the carbon price support cps has encouraged generators and industry to invest in lower carbon and renewable technologies it has also forced coal generators to fire their boilers only when they are really needed to meet demand such as during the winter months or at times of peak demand and still or overcast weather conditions during the summer months the introduction of the carbon price has meant that gas power stations which are less carbon intensive than coal have jumped ahead of coal in the economic merit order of energy generation technologies and produced a greater share of the uks power the same is the case for former coal generation units that have since upgraded to sustainable biomass  three such units at drax power station result in savings in greenhouse gas ghg emissions of at least 80 a coal cliff edge the carbon price support has resulted in significant savings in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions helping the uk meet its international climate change commitments removing or reducing the cps too soon and britains power mix risks going back in time it would improve the economics of coal and encourage britains remaining coal power stations to stay open for longer creating a risk to security of supply through a cliff edge of coal closures in the mid2020s changing the economics to favour coal also makes it harder to reach the uk governments goal of bringing a new fleet of gas power stations online what if  dr iain staffell from the centre for environmental policy at imperial college london has modelled a scenario in which the carbon price support did not exist in 2016 if the government had abolished all carbon pricing we would probably have seen a 20 increase in the power sectors carbon emissions said staffell removing the carbon price support would have the equivalent environmental impact of every single person in the uk deciding to drive a car once a year from lands end to john ogroats without the carbon price support emissions from electricity consumption would be 20 higher meaning an extra 250 kg per person equivalent to driving a car 800 miles running the numbers the carbon price support is capped at 18tco 2 until 2021 in his budget on 8 th march 2017 chancellor philip hammond  rightly in the view of drax  confirmed the governments commitment to carbon pricing using data from national grid and elexon and analysis from dr iain staffell electric insights shows how coal power generation was only needed last winter when electricity demand was greater than could be produced by other technologies alone coal was only used at times of peak demand because it was among the most expensive energy technologies in part due to the cps what if that wasnt the case and the government had decided to scrap the cps before that point in time more coal is burnt particularly during the daytimes  on average coal produces 2500 mw more over this week equivalent to four of drax power stations six generation units and what does dr iain staffells model suggest would have happened if the cap was doubled to 36tco 2  the change is stark even for a week in the winter with an average temperature across the country of 86 o c to see coal generation reduced so much compared to the actual cps of 18tco 2 or the 0tco 2 scenario model illustrates the impact of the carbon price support could bill payers save one argument for reducing the carbon price support  or scrapping it altogether  is the possibility that consumers and nondomestic electricity bill payers would save money its worth noting that apparent savings for electricity bill payers are lowered when the whole way that power is priced is accounted for by the time it reaches homes and businesses carbon price support does increase the cost of wholesale power says staffell but if you add the extra taxes other renewable and low carbon support measures transmission and balancing charges and fees imposed by electricity suppliers the overall impact on consumer bills is modest so if the government abolished all carbon pricing we could expect a 1 pkwh reduction in our tariffs but a 21 increase in our carbon emissions as a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers from imperial college london has already shown there are other ways to save bill payers money while encouraging a low carbon future their analysis published in early 2016 found that households and businesses could save 2bn if the government considered the whole system cost of electricity generation and supply when designing its competitions for support under its contracts for difference cfd scheme 2016 redux without the carbon price support the uk wouldnt have managed to send carbon emissions back to 19 th century levels  so if 2016 was played out one more time but with no carbon price support coal generation would have increased by 102 28 terawatthours to 56 twh gas generation would have decreased by 21 27 twh to 101 twh carbon emissions would have risen by 21 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to 92mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have increased by 20 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 349 gco 2 kwh and if 2016 had seen a doubling of the cps to 36tco 2  coal generation would have decreased by 47 129 twh to 147 twh gas generation would have increased by 9 118 twh to 1395 twh carbon emissions would have decreased by 10 73 mt co 2  to 686 mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have decreased by 9 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 263 gco 2 kwh the two scenarios presented above only modelled the impact of no or a higher carbon price support on nuclear coal and gas power supply in the realworld changes to the carbon price support would also impact on energy technologies that operate under the renewables obligation ro such as two of draxs three biomass units and much of the countrys other renewable capacity cps changes would also likely impact imports and storage while no analysis is perfect this clearly illustrates the significantly negative impact that scrapping or reducing the carbon price support would have on the uks decarbonisation agenda it also highlights the benefits that the governments decision to remain committed to carbon pricing will deliver what if  britain had no carbon price support httpstcongz1jzmhtx pictwittercommiusyf73gq  drax draxgroup march 13 2017 commissioned by drax electric insights is
