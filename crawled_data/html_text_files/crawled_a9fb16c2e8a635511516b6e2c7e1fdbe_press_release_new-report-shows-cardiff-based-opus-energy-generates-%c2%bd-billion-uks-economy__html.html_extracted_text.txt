New report shows Cardiff-based Opus Energy generates more than £½ billion for the UK’s economy
18 October 2017
Leading energy supplier Opus Energy contributed £588m towards UK GDP in 2016 and supported nearly 7,000 jobs across the country. The findings were revealed in a new report looking at the economic impact of British energy company Drax Group, which Opus Energy joined earlier this year.
In the space of a decade Opus Energy has grown from a challenger brand to the sixth largest supplier of gas and electricity to British businesses. It provides energy to over 300,000 customer meters, including national brands such as Lloyds Pharmacy and White Stuff.
The company opened its Cardiff office in the newly built Capital Quarter in the centre of the city in 2016, with around 70 employees based on site.
The report also found that in Wales alone, Opus Energy and Drax combined to generate £130 million in the local economy and support 1,600 jobs.
Researchers at Oxford Economics used three measures to calculate Opus Energy’s GDP contribution: the economic activity associated with the day-to-day running of the business; the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers; and the wages the company’s employees and suppliers’ employees spend in their local area.
Opus Energy’s activities support employment in a wide range of sectors including renewable energy generation, IT, professional business services and transport.
Drax Group Retail CEO, Jonathan Kini said:
“This report shows that in addition to being a leading supplier of energy to British businesses, Opus Energy, and the rest of Drax Group also play an important role in the local and national economy. Through the people we employ and the businesses we use, we have supported thousands of jobs and generated nearly £1.7 billion of economic activity across the UK.”
Opus Energy COO, Nikki Flanders said:
“The new customer support centre we opened in the Capital Quarter last year is a key part of Opus Energy’s strategy to deliver a level of service unmatched by our competitors. In addition to employing people from the local area, over time we expect our operations to make an increasingly significant contribution to the local economy.”
Osman Ismail, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics, said:
“The implementation of the Group’s new strategy means that Drax is uniquely placed to impact the wider challenges for the UK’s energy system through helping to balance the Grid.
“The Opus Energy acquisition solidifies Drax’s principal activities of generating energy and supplying energy services to businesses and directly impacts a number of different regions in the UK in terms of both job creation and contribution to GDP.”
