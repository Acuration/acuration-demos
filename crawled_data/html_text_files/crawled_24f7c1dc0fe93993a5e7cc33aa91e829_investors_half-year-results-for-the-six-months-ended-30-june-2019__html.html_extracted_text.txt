Outlook
Full year EBITDA and net debt expectations unchanged; remain subject to re-establishment of Capacity Market
Generation – strong contracted position and system support services, higher H2 biomass generation
Pellet Production – growth in H2 pellet volumes, focus on cost reduction and improved quality
Customers (formerly B2B Energy Supply) – focus on increasing gross profit, reducing bad debt and cost to serve
Attractive investment options for growth: biomass capacity expansion, cost reduction and new gas generation
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive of Drax Group said:
Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group. Click to view high resolution photo.
“Drax Group has delivered strong profit and dividend growth in the first half of the year. Integration of our new Hydro and Gas generation assets is progressing well and the value the Group delivers from supporting the energy system has almost doubled.
Drax is supporting British business with innovative new energy services and, despite challenging market conditions, our Customers business continues to grow. Our biomass cost reduction initiative and plans for expanded biomass self-supply are going well.
“Drax wholeheartedly supports the UK’s target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”
“Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by half in the past year underscores Drax’s commitment to this goal. With the right investment and regulatory framework we could go further and Drax could become the world’s first carbon negative power station – something the UK Committee on Climate Change recognises will be crucial.”
Operational review
Pellet Production –
Focus on capacity expansion with good quality pellets at lowest cost
Adjusted EBITDA of £8 million (H1 2018: £10 million)
Pellet production 0.65Mt (H1 2018: 0.66Mt) – weather-affected forestry activities and lower pellet production
Good progress with cost reduction initiatives
Initiatives for run rate savings of £10/MWh on 0.45Mt pa from LaSalle pellet plant
Rail spur operational May 2019 – reduction in transport cost to Port of Baton Rouge
Co-location agreement with Hunt Forest Products for low-cost sawmill residues, now operational
Port of Baton Rouge rail agreement – increased rail capacity and lower costs for LaSalle and Morehouse
Capacity expansion with run rate savings of £20/MWh on 0.35Mt
£50 million investment in 0.35Mt capacity increase at LaSalle, Morehouse and Amite, commissioning 2020/21
Pellet and hammermill upgrades to enable greater utilisation of low-cost sawmill residues and dry shavings
Power Generation –
Flexible, low-carbon and renewable generation
Adjusted EBITDA of £148 million (H1 2018: £88 million)
Contribution of Hydro and Gas assets following acquisition from ScottishPower – £36 million
Strong system support performance – 92% increase in value from flexibility
(5)
– £69 million (H1 2018: £36 million)
Suspension of Capacity Market – £34 million of H1 revenue not accrued (H1 2018: £6 million recognised)
Biomass output (net sales) up 2% to 6.4TWh (H1 2018: 6.3TWh)
ROC
(9)
generation reprofiled to reflect weather-affected US biomass supplies – optimise within ROC cap and utilise fourth biomass unit to produce expected higher levels of ROC generation in H2 2019
Lower thermal output
Coal – higher carbon costs, lower margins and reduced output – buy back opportunities for hedged sales
Gas – Damhead Creek restricted hours ahead of inspection and Shoreham interim inspection brought forward
Customers –
Continued growth in meters and margin per MWh, implementing structure to support long-term growth
Adjusted EBITDA of £9 million (H1 2018: £16 million)
Increased operating costs associated with integration, restructuring and development of next generation system
Weather-related reduction in energy consumption and increased focus on margin per MWh
Continued growth in gross profit per MWh
Growth in customer meters to 405,000 (H2 2018: 396,000)
Improvement in bad debt £13 million (H1 2018: £18 million)
Progressing with integration of Opus and Haven
Focused on creation of scalable platform for growth, improved gross margin, reduction in bad debt and cost to serve
