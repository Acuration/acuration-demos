power station visit drax power station drax kickstarts planning process to expand its iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station project supports scotlands net zero target 24 june 2021 the decision to seek planning permission to expand pumped storage hydro at cruachan demonstrates draxs commitment to scotland and is a landmark moment in unlocking the vast renewable resources needed in the uk ahead of cop 26 in glasgow pumped storage hydro is a critical technology which enables more renewable power and supports scotlands electricity system helping the country towards its target of reaching net zero by 2045 five years before the uk as a whole work to build draxs new pumped storage hydro power station could begin as soon as 2024 removing 1 million tonnes of rock from inside ben cruachan and creating hundreds of jobs across rural scotland renewable energy company drax group is kickstarting the planning process to build a new underground pumped storage hydro power station  more than doubling the electricity generating capacity at its iconic cruachan facility in scotland the project announced as the uk prepares to host the cop26 climate conference in glasgow will support almost 900 jobs in rural areas across scotland during construction and will provide critical storage capacity needed to support a net zero power system the 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the new power station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side to the east of draxs existing 440mw pumped storage hydro station more than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station the existing upper reservoir which can hold 24 billion gallons of water has the capacity to serve both power stations an artists impression of cruachan 2 top and the existing cruachan power station bottom  click to viewdownload  like draxs existing site the new station will be able to provide lifeline stability services to the power system alongside acting like a giant water battery by using reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside the station can store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand the stored water would then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this will help to cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power the new station would have the capacity to generate enough power for around a million homes will gardiner drax group ceo said drax group ceo will gardiner  click to viewdownload  this is an exciting and important project which underlines draxs commitment to tackling the climate crisis and supporting the energy system as it continues to decarbonise our plans to expand cruachan will unlock more renewable electricity to power homes and businesses across the country and support hundreds of new jobs in rural scotland last year the uks lack of energy storage capacity meant wind farms had to be paid to turn off and we lost out on enough renewable power to supply a million homes we need to stop renewable power from going to waste by storing it and drax is ready to move mountains to do just that turbine hall cruachan power station  click to viewdownload  draxs decision to pursue planning approval has been welcomed by the hollow mountains local mp and msp brendan ohara argyll  bute mp said i am delighted that drax is progressing plans to expand the ben cruachan site this will support 900 rural jobs and create a pumped storage facility that will be able to provide enough renewable energy to power a million homes while helping us reach our 2045 net zero target it is great news for this area and for scotland jenni minto argyll  bute msp said investment in new pumped storage hydro capacity could greatly enhance the flexibility and resilience of the electricity network and help us move towards meeting our ambitious global climate change targets in the runup to cop26 in glasgow its more vital than ever that we come up with innovative solutions to the climate emergency and ensure that future generations to reap the rewards of scotlands vast renewable potential in order to deploy this critical technology drax must secure consent under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 from scottish ministers  a process which takes around one year to complete from the applications submission alongside a successful section 36 application the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the existing lack of a framework for largescale longduration storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation the first phase of the section 36 application process includes public consultation this summer when people can provide comments on draxs proposals for cruachan via the project website from 1 july further consultation events are planned for later in the year and an application is then expected to be submitted to scottish ministers in early 2022 ends media contact aidan kerr media manager generation e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes the local community can view early stage proposals for the project ask questions and leave feedback for drax at a virtual public exhibition which begins on 1 july at the projects website cruachanexpansioncom with section 36 consent from the scottish government and an updated revenue stabilisation mechanism from the uk government work to build the new pumped storage hydro power station could get underway in 2024 with it becoming operational supplying flexible power to the grid in 2030 no investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework with the uk government a recent report by the renewable energy association rea highlighted the policy barriers to deploying longduration energy storage and suggested ways to address these barriers such as through the introduction of an income floor analysis by pumped storage hydro experts stantec for drax shows 876 jobs will be supported directly and indirectly during construction built on the shores of loch awe in argyll in the 1960s cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system of its scale to be built in the world the upper reservoir on the mountainside can store 111 million cubic metres 24bn gallons  thats enough to fill 4440 olympic swimming pools independent analysis by lane clark and peacock lcp found the uk curtailed 36twh of wind power last year enough renewable electricity to supply around a million homes a separate independent report by academics from imperial college london recently found that just 45 gw of new pumped storage hydro could save up to 690m per year in energy system costs by 2050 draxs scottish operations include hydro facilities in galloway and lanark and a biomassfromwaste plant at daldowie near glasgow along with cruachan all of which were acquired at the beginning of 2019 main photo of
