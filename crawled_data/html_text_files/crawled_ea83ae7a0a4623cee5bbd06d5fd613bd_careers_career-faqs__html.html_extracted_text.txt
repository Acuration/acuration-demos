Career FAQs
Frequently asked questions about careers at Drax Group
Thinking about working for us? Take a look at the following FAQs.
How do I apply for a vacancy?
When you find a vacancy that interests you, the application process is simple. Select ‘apply now’ for the position you wish to apply for, then work through the registration and application process for the role.
Alternatively, if you have previously registered on our
current vacancies website
,
log in using your email address and password and select ‘apply now’ for the position you wish to apply for.
When you’ve completed the necessary sections, you’ll need to accept the terms and conditions and this will submit your application. You will receive an email to confirm that your application has been submitted.
How do I reset my password?
If you can’t remember your password, select ‘login’, enter your email address and use the option to reset password. If your address is found, we’ll send you an email with a randomly generated password. You’ll then need to log in using this password, but will be prompted to change this to something more memorable. If you’re still having problems, please contact the relevant recruitment team using the contact details at the bottom of the
vacancies page
.
How do I find out about new vacancies?
All our vacancies are advertised on our
current vacancies website
.
On this page you will see a link called ‘create job alert’. By clicking this you can set up a job alert based on the types of role you are looking for as well as the location in which it is based. Once a job alert has been created, you will receive an email each time a job matching your search criteria is posted.
If you’d like to unsubscribe from these emails at any time you can do this by logging into your profile and managing your settings.
What does Drax expect from me?
We expect you to do your best. If you apply for a job here, we anticipate that you’ll spend some time to find out about the company – this might be from our website or from any other source that may help you.
Make your application relevant to the job and include a covering letter explaining why you would like to be considered. We expect successful applicants to be good performers, to have a good attendance record and to
demonstrate our values
.
What happens to my application after I have applied?
Once you have submitted your application you’ll receive an email to confirm that your application has been received. We will then start our shortlisting process. If you are logged into our
current vacancies website
, you can track the status of your application by logging in and viewing your current applications.
What are the next steps if I am shortlisted?
If you are shortlisted, we will contact you to let you know the next step in the process – this will depend on the role you have applied for. As part of the recruitment process you may be asked to participate in an interview, testing (e.g. aptitude, personality, verbal and numerical reasoning) and in some cases be asked to attend an assessment centre.
Where could I be working?
The majority of our UK workforce is based at Drax Power Station which is located near Selby in North Yorkshire. It is within commuting distance of towns and cities such as Leeds, York, Doncaster and Hull, with motorway links to the M62, M1 and A1.
However, there may be roles in other locations, including London, Cardiff, Ipswich, Northampton, Argyll and Bute, Dumfries and Galloway and Lanarkshire.
Please ensure you check the details of the vacancy before applying.
What happens to the information I give on the diversity page?
The information is used to monitor the effectiveness of
our diversity and equality policy
, and to ensure our recruitment process is fair. Your data will be kept confidential within HR and may be used in summary reports to management teams, trade unions and employee representatives, but these reports do not identify individuals.
Does Drax work with recruitment agencies?
We work with a number of recruitment agencies that we have agreed terms and conditions with. If you are a recruitment agency and would like the opportunity to work with us in the future, please contact the relevant resourcing team using the contact details at the bottom of our
current vacancies website
with a brief overview of your agency, the area you specialise in, and your contact details. If we are interested in working with you, we will get in touch. We do not accept emailed CVs – these must be uploaded to our current vacancies website.
What if I have a query about the progress of my application?
Please log in to our
current vacancies website
and view your application, where you’ll be able to see the status of your application. If the status is pending, then we are still processing your application. For some of our vacancies we receive a large number of applications and therefore the initial selection process can take a number of weeks or months. We will always send you an update on your application, even if you have not been successful. We therefore ask for your patience during this process.
What security checks will I undergo?
The law to prevent illegal working requires all new employees to produce an accepted, original form of identification. Guidance on this will be included in any formal offer of employment. We also require two satisfactory references and documentary evidence of all the academic and professional qualifications, and registration with professional bodies, listed on your CV.
Will I have to complete a medical questionnaire?
If you progress to receiving a formal offer of employment you will be asked to complete a medical assessment questionnaire. Your completed questionnaire will then be returned directly to our occupational health team, who may follow up with a medical assessment if appropriate.
Do you provide relocation assistance?
We have a relocation assistance policy which is applied where appropriate.
If I am not successful, will you let me know?
We will always contact you to let you know the outcome of your application, usually via email. Please also check your junk email folder, as sometimes our system-generated mails can be classed as junk by your provider.
If I would like feedback on my application, who can I speak to?
We are unable to provide feedback on individual applications and CVs. If you attend an interview it will be possible for you to receive feedback..
How do I register my interest in working for Drax?
You can register your details and CV on our system by creating an account. By doing this, it means we can search for your relevant skills and qualifications when suitable vacancies arise. It also enables you to set up email alerts for when we post a new job (see above).
How long will my details remain on the system?
Your details will remain on our system for 12 months, in line with
data protection
laws. If you do not log in to your account for 11 months, you’ll receive an email to notify you your account has been deleted.
If you receive an email letting you know what your account with expire in 30 days, you can reactivate this simply by logging back into your profile.
