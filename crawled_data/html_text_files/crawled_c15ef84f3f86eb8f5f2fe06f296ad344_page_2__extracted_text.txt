efficiently from generators through power lines and across the country into our devices is a careful balancing act one of the vital aspects of this is the voltage an electrical substation with transformers the national grids transmission lines work at a voltage of 400000 volts v and 275000v but if electricity were to enter homes at this voltage it would quickly damage anything it powered instead regional distributors deliver electricity into homes at a much lower level of 230v achieving a voltage level thats safe to use requires stepping it up or down through transformers  huge pieces of electrical grid equipment that use a simple idea to have a big impact why we need transformers voltage is like water pressure having high voltage transmission lines means the charged electrons that make up electricity are moving very efficiently through the system with less energy being lost as heat along the way however that same pressure is too much for just charging a phone it would likely overload the devices circuits and leave the user with a smouldering mess thats where transformers step in electricity is produced at a variety of voltages around great britain depending on different types of generation in order to send it to where the demand is without losing too much energy as heat along the journey  a transformer attached to large power generators such as draxs biomass power plant or beatrice offshore wind farm increases the voltage to 400000v or 275000v the voltage depends on what part of the national transmission system the power station is connected to when the electricity arrives via pylons at a particular region of great britain another transformer brings the voltage down to 132000v for the regional distribution system subsequently another reduces it to 11000v in towns and villages before a final transformer reduces the voltage to a safe 230v for use in homes and businesses keeping the voltage high is useful in preventing energy loss to heat but it also does something else important to the electricity shooting around the country keeping voltage high to cut down current if voltage is the water pressure then current is the actual water particles moving through the pipes in electrical terms the current is the charged electrons that actually power our lights and devices when these electrons travel along the electricity grids cables they face resistance imagine a partial blockage in a water pipe this causes some electrical energy to be lost to heat getting the right amount of electricity needed around the country means keeping energy loss as low as possible if the current is lower fewer charged electrons are bumping into resistance at any one point in the system and less electrical energy is being lost conveniently for the grid raising the voltage of electricity causes the current to decrease and vice versa how transformers actually do this is all a matter of coils transformer at cruachan power station winding voltage up and down transformers work using the principal of electromagnetic induction something the british scientist michael faraday first realised in 1831 he noticed that when a magnet moved through a coil of copper wires a current flowed through those wires its this same principal that enables spinning turbines to generate electricity today  michael faraday similarly when a current flows through a copper coil wrapped around an iron core the core becomes magnetic  faraday did experiment with running currents through multiple copper coils but it was scientist and irish priest father nicholas callan who in 1836 discovered the underlying principal of many of the worlds transformers today he found if two separate sets of copper wires were wound around each end of an iron core and an electrical current was passed through one of them the primary winding then a magnetic field is created that causes an electric current to flow in the secondary winding however things change depending on how many times each wire is wound around the core if there are more turns in the secondary winding than the primary one then when a current is induced the voltage increases when there are fewer turns in the secondary winding than the primary the voltage decreases callans induction coil 1845 moreover father callan discovered that the increase or decrease in voltage is directly proportional to the number of turns in the windings so theoretically if an electrical current with a voltage of 5v is passed through a primary winding with 10 turns and creates a current in a secondary winding with 20 turns the voltage will also double in this case to 10v father callans invention is known as an induction coil where the two sets of windings share a long thick iron rod since then the transformer has undergone continual revision optimisation and specialisation for different use cases however the underlying principal of using electromagnetic induction to increase and decrease voltage remains the same from homes to power stations one of the most common types of transformers are distribution transformers  the kind often found on utility poles near homes these transformers perform the final step down from local distribution systems to 230v as the electricity enters homes and businesses these often use an iron core that takes the form of a hollow square with windings wrapped around both ends when a current passes through and magnetises the core it causes it to expand and contract in a process known as magnetostriction which sometimes causes enough vibration to produce an audible hum  a transformer being moved from longannet to cruachan power station in 2019 in these type of transformers its safe for the current to be transferred through the air between the two windings but when higher voltages are being used such as at cruachan power station  the biggest pumped storage facility in scotland  different approaches are needed large power stationscale transformers are submerged in a special insulating oil inside a metal container  the oil provides electrical insulation to prevent short circuits while also cooling the core and windings preventing damage and failure even as the main sources of great britains electricity change from coal and nuclear power stations to wind farms and solar panels transformers will remain an essential part of the grid in getting the right amount of power to where we need it  fast tags electricity generation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services 4 of the longest running electrical objects 15 june 2020 electrification how long do your electrical devices last were not talking about battery life but the overall lifetime of the items we use every day that are powered by electricity its accepted that todays electrical devices have short life spans in part a symptom of rapidly evolving technology fuelling the need for constant consumer updates and in part a result of planned obsolescence devices being manufactured to fail within a set number of years to encourage repeat purchases electrical devices arent purchased with the belief they will last a lifetime but it hasnt always been this way before rapid technological development and the rise of fast consumerism devices were built to last over the relatively short history of electrical appliances there are tools and equipment that have operated for decades some of these remain in operation today with hardly any alterations but for a few tweaks here and there to upgrade or preserve built to last here are a few of the longest running electrical inventions the oxford electric bell located in the clarendon laboratory university of oxford 1840  the oxford electric bell the oxford electric bell is not your typical bell  not just in how it looks but in the fact it has been in constant operation since the mid 19 th century it consists of two primitive batteries called dry piles with bells fitted at each end and a metal ball that vibrates between them to very quietly continuously ring its original purpose is unidentified but what is known is that the bell is the result of an experiment put on by the london instrumentmanufacturing firm watkins and hill in 1840 acquired by robert walker a physics professor at the university of oxford in the mid 1800s its displayed at oxfords clarendon laboratory which explains why its also known as the clarendon pile the exact makeup of the dry piles is unknown as no one wants to tamper with them to investigate their composition out for fear of ending the bells 179yearlong streak as a result confusion remains as to why the oxford electric bell has remained in operation for so long souter lighthouse tyneside england 1871  souter lighthouse in south shields uk the lamp in the souter lighthouse  situated between the rivers tyne and wear was the most advanced of its day when it was first constructed designed to use an alternating electric current it was the first purposebuilt electrically powered lighthouse in the world although no longer in operation today it ran unchanged for nearly 50 years the light was generated using carbon arc lamps  and it originally produced a beam of red light that would come on once every five seconds souters original lamp operated unchanged from 1871 to 1914 when it was replaced by more conventional oil lamps it was altered again to run on mains electric power in 1952 and was finally deactivated in 1988 1896  the isle of mans manx electric railway tourism hit the isle of man in the 1880s and with it came the construction of hotels and boarding houses two businessmen saw this as an opportunity to purchase a large estate on the island and develop it into housing and a pleasure development the manx parliament approved the sale in 1892 on one condition that a road and a tramway be built to give people access snaefell mountain railway station isle of man it was decided that the tram would be electric and work began in the spring of 1893 with the tram system up and running by september of that year although the track and its cars have been extended and updated over time the first three cars remain the longest running electric tramcars in the world  photograph by dick jones centennialbulborg 1902  the centennial bulb the unassuming centennial bulb has been working in the livermore california fire department for 117 years the bulb was first installed in 1902 in the departments hose cart house but was later moved to livermores fire station 6 where it has been illuminated for more than a million hours throughout its life the centennial bulb has seen just two interruptions for a week in 1937 when the firehouse was refurbished and in may 2013 when it was off for nine and a half hours due to a failed power supply made by the shelby electric company the handblown bulb previously shone at 60 watts but has since been dimmed to 4 watts while this means it isnt able to actually illuminate much it is a reminder that despite

the largest concentrated solar farm in the world  morocco is already streets ahead in its ability to capture and convert sunlight into power the 3000 hectare solar complex known as noorouarzazate  has a capacity of 580 megawatts mw which provides enough power for a city twice the size of marrakesh noorouarzazate power plant morocco image source acwa power its uses curved mirrors to direct sunlight into a singular beam that creates enough heat to melt salt in a central tower this stores the heat and  when needed  is used to create steam which spins a turbine and generates electricity this has helped keep morocco on course to achieve its goal of deriving 42 of its power from renewable sources by the end of 2020 which potentially means a surplus in the coming years morocco already has 14 gigawatts gw of interconnection with spain  and another 700 mw is scheduled to come online before 2026 the countrys close proximity to europe could make its solar capacity a source of power across the continent africas geothermal potential olkaria ii geothermal power plant in kenya kenya was the first african nation to embrace geothermal energy and has now been using it for decades in 1985 kenyas geothermal generation produced 45 mw of power  30 years later the country now turns over 630 mw  kenyas ample generation of geothermal electricity is due to an abundance of steam energy in the underground volcanic wells of olkaria in the great rift valley in 2015 the region was responsible for providing 47 of the countrys power currently the olkaria region is thought to have a potential capacity of 2 gw of power which could help to provide a source of clean energy for kenyas neighbours however there is potential for the rest of east africa to generate its own geothermal power in this region of the continent there is an estimated 20 gw of power generation capacity possible from stored geothermal energy while the demand for the creation of usable grids that can connect multiple countries is high kenya is currently expanding its own grid installing a planned 3600 miles of new electrical wiring across the country winds of change chinas position in the renewable energy market is already up top with continuous investment in solar and hydro power giving it a renewable capacity of more than 700 gw the country is also home to the worlds largest onshore wind farm in the form of the gansu wind farm project which is made up of over 7000 turbines  it is set to have a capacity of 20 gw by the end of 2020 bringing the nationwide installed wind capacity to 250 gw with china exporting more than 20000 gigawatthours gwh of electricity in 2018  large scale renewable projects can have a widereaching effect beyond its borders southasia is the primary market but excesses of power in western china have stoked ideas of exporting power as far away as germany  can the us store the worlds carbon in the quest for zerocarbon energy it wont just be nations that can export excess energy that could stand to profit  those that can import emissions could also benefit while many countries are developing the capabilities to capture carbon dioxide co 2  storing it safely and permanently is another question  having underground facilities that can store co 2 creates an opportunity to import and sequester carbon as a service for other nations norway is already doing it but the us has the greatest potential thanks to its abundance of large underground storage capabilities the global ccs institute highlights the us as the country most prepared to deploy carbon capture and storage ccs at scale thanks to its vast landscape history of injecting co 2 in enhanced oil recovery and favourable government policies the petra nova plant in texas is also known as the worlds largest carbon capture facility  the coalpower station captured more than 1 million tonnes of co 2 within the first 10 months of operating as a 654 mw unit carbon capture facility at the petra nova coalfired power plant texas usa chiles hydrogen innovation hydrogen is becoming increasingly relevant as an energy source thanks to its ability to generate electricity and power transport while releasing far fewer emissions than other fossil fuels chile was an early proponent of energy sharing with its hydrogen programme the country uses solar electricity generated in the atacama desert which sees 3000 hours of sunlight a year to power hydrogen production in a process called electrolysis which uses electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen chile plans to export the gas to japan and south korea  but with global demand for hydrogen set to grow highervolume furtherreaching exporting of the countrys hydrogen could soon be on the way going forward these green innovations  from carbon storage to geothermal potential  could increasingly be shared between countries and continents in an attempt to lower the overall carbon footprint of the worlds energy this could create a global power shift toward nations which rather than having high capacity for fossil fuel extraction can instead use a different set of natural resources to generate store and export cleaner energy

our lives its become something we take for granted rarely do we stop to consider the path it took to become ubiquitous and yet through the course of its history there have been several eureka moments and breakthrough inventions that have shaped our modern lives here are some of the defining moments in the development of electricity and power 2750 bc  electricity first recorded in the form of electric fish ancient egyptians referred to electric catfish as the  thunderers of the nile  and were fascinated by these creatures it led to a near millennia of wonder and intrigue including conducting and documenting crude experiments  such as touching the fish with an iron rod to cause electric shocks 500 bc  the discovery of static electricity around 500 bc thales of miletus discovered that static electricity could be made by rubbing lightweight objects such as fur or feathers on amber this static effect remained unknown for almost 2000 years until around 1600 ad when william gilbert discovered static electricity in earnest 1600 ad  the origins of the word electricity the latin word electricus  which translates to of amber was used by the english physician william gilbert to describe the force exerted when items are rubbed together a few years later english scientist thomas browne translated this into electricity in his written investigations in the field 1751  benjamin franklins experiments and observations on electricity this book of benjamin franklin s discoveries made about the behaviour of electricity was published in 1751 the publication and translation of american founding father scientist and inventors letters would provide the basis for all further electricity experimentation it also introduced a host of new terms to the field including positive negative charge battery and electric shock 1765  james watt transforms the industrial revolution watt studies newcomens engine james watt transformed the industrial revolution with the invention of a modified newcome engine now known as the watt steam engine  machines no longer had to rely on the sometimestemperamental wind water or manpower  instead steam from boiling water could drive the pistons back and forth although watts engine didnt generate electricity it created a foundation that would eventually lead to the steam turbine  still the basis of much of the globes electricity generation today james watts steam engine alessandro volta 1800  voltas first true battery documented records of batterylike objects date back to 250 bc but the first true battery was invented by italian scientist alessandro volta in 1800  volta realised that a current was created when zinc and silver were immersed in an electrolyte  the principal on which chemical batteries are still based today 1800s  the first electrical cars breakthroughs in electric motors and batteries in the early 1800s led to experimentation with electrically powered vehicles the british inventor robert anderson is often credited with developing the first crude electric carriage at the beginning of the 19 th century but it would not be until 1890 that american chemist william morrison would invent the first practical electric car though it closer resembled a motorised wagon boasting a top speed of 14 miles per hour michael faraday 1831  michael faradays electric dynamo faradays invention of the electric dynamo power generator set the precedent for electricity generation for centuries to come his invention converted motive or mechanical power  such as steam gas water and wind turbines  into electromagnetic power at a low voltage although rudimentary it was a breakthrough in generating consistent continuous electricity and opened the door for the likes of thomas edison and joseph swan whose subsequent discoveries would make largescale electricity generation feasible 1879  lighting becomes practical and inexpensive thomas edison patented the first practical and accessible incandescent light bulb  using a carbonised bamboo filament which could burn for more than 1200 hours edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent lightbulb on 31 st december 1879 where he stated that electricity would be so cheap that only the rich would burn candles although he was not the only inventor to experiment with incandescent light his was the most enduring and practical he would soon go on to develop not only the bulb but an entire electrical lighting system  holborn viaduct power station via wikimedia 1882  the worlds first public power station opens holborn viaduct power station also known as the edison electric light station  burnt coal to drive a steam turbine and generate electricity the power was used for holborns newly electrified streetlighting an idea which would quickly spread around london 1880s  tesla and edisons current war nikola tesla and thomas edison waged what came to be known as the current war in 1880s america tesla was determined to prove that alternating current ac  as is generated at power stations  was safe for domestic use going against the edison groups opinion that a direct current dc  as delivered from a battery  was safer and more reliable inside an edison power station in new york the conflict led to years of risky demonstrations and experiments including one where tesla electrocuted himself in front of an audience to prove he would not be harmed the war continued as they fought over the future of electric power generation until eventually ac won nikola tesla 1901  great britains first industrial power station opens before charles mertz and william mclellan of merz  mclellan built the neptune bank power station in tyneside in 1901 individual factories were powered by private generators by contrast the neptune bank power station could supply reliable cheap power to multiple factories that were connected through highvoltage transmission lines this was the beginning of britains national grid system 1990s  the first mass market electrical vehicle ev concepts for electric cars had been around for a century however the general motors ev1 was the first model to be mass produced by a major car brand  made possible with the breakthrough invention of the rechargeable battery however this ev1 model could not be purchased only directly leased on a monthly contract because of this its expensive build and relatively small customer following the model only lasted six years before general motors crushed the majority of their cars 2018  renewable generation accounts

electricity safe 6 march 2020 power generation electricity networks around the world differ many ways from the frequency they run at to the fuels theyre powered by to the infrastructure they run on but they all share at least one core component circuits a circuit allows an electrical current to flow from one point to another moving it around the grid to seamlessly power street lights domestic devices and heavy industry without them electricity would have nowhere to flow and no means of reaching the things it needs to power but electricity can be volatile and when something goes wrong its often on circuits that problems first manifest thats where circuit breakers come in these devices can jump into action and break a circuit cutting off electricity flow to the faulty circuit and preventing catastrophe in homes and at grid scale all this must be done in milliseconds says drax electrical engineer jamie beardsall but to fully understand exactly how circuit breakers save the day its important to understand how and why circuits works circuits within circuits circuits work thanks to the natural properties of electricity which always wants to flow from a high voltage to a lower one  in the case of a battery or mains plug this means there are always two sides a negative side with a voltage of zero and a positive side with a higher voltage in a simple circuit electricity flows in a current along a conductive path from the positive side where there is a voltage to the negative side where there is a lower or no voltage the amount of current flowing depends on both the voltage applied and the size of the load within the circuit were able to make use of this flow of electricity by adding electrical devices  for example a lightbulb  to the circuit when the electricity moves through the circuit it also passes through the device in turn powering it a row of switched on household electrical circuit breakers on a wall panel the national grid  your regional power distributor our homes businesses and more are all composed of multiple circuits that enable the flow of electricity this means that if one circuit fails for example if a tree branch falls on a transmission cable only that circuit is affected rather than the entire nations electricity connection at a smaller scale if one light bulb in a house blows it will only affect that circuit not the entire building and while the cause of failures on circuits may vary from fallen tree branches to serious wiring faults to too many highvoltage appliances plugged into a single circuit  causing currents to shoot up and overload circuits the solution to preventing them is almost always the same fuses and circuit breakers in homes circuits are often protected from dangerously high currents by fuses which in great britain are normally found in standard threepin plugs and fuse boxes in a three pin plug each fuse contains a small wire  or element an electrical fuse when electricity passes through the circuit and fuse it heats up the wire but if the current running through the circuit gets too high the wire overheats and disintegrates breaking the circuit and preventing the wires and devices attached to it from being damaged when a fuse like this breaks in a plug or a fuse box it must be replaced a circuit breaker however can carry out this task again and again  instead of a piece of wire circuit breakers use an electromagnetic switch  when the circuit breaker is on the current flows through two points of contact when the current is at a normal level the adjacent electromagnet is not strong enough to separate the contact points however if the current increases to a dangerous level the electromagnet is triggered to kick into action and pulls one contact point away breaking the circuit and opening the circuit breaker another approach to fuses is using a strip made of two different types of metals as current increases and temperatures rise one metal expands faster than the other causing the strip to bend and break the circuit once the connection is broken the strip cools allowing the circuit breaker to be reset this approach means the problem on the circuit can be identified and solved for example by unplugging a highvoltage appliance from the circuit before flipping the switch back on and reconnecting the circuit protecting generators at grid scale power circuit breakers for a highvoltage network circuit breakers are important in residential circuits but at grid level they become even more crucial in preventing widescale damage to the transmission system and electricity generators if part of a transmission circuit is damaged for example by high winds blowing over a power line the current flow within that circuit can be disrupted and can flow to earth rather than to its intended load or destination this is what is known as a short circuit much like in the home a short circuit can result in dangerous increases in current with the potential to damage equipment in the circuit or nearby equipment used in transmission circuits can cost millions of pounds to replace so it is important this current flow is stopped as quickly as possible circuit breakers are the light switches of the transmission system says beardsall they must operate within milliseconds of an abnormal condition being detected however in terms of similarities with the home this is where it ends current levels in the home are small  usually below 13 amps a or ampere for an individual circuit with the total current coming into a home rarely exceeding 80a in a transmission system current levels are much higher beardsall explains a single transmission circuit can have current flows in excess of 2000a and voltages up to 400000 volts because the current flowing through the transmission system is much greater than that around a home breaking the circuit and stopping the current flow becomes much harder a small air gap is enough to break a circuit at a domestic level but at gridscale voltage is so high it can arc over air gaps creating a visible plasma bridge  to suppress this the contact points of the circuit breakers used in transmission systems are often contained in housings filled with insulating gases or within a vacuum which are not conductive and help to break the circuit a 400kv circuit breaker on the drax power station site in addition there will often be several contact points within a single circuit breaker to help break the high current and voltage levels older circuit breakers used oil or highpressure air for breaking current although these are now largely obsolete in a transmission system circuit breakers will usually be triggered by relays  devices which measure the current flowing through the circuit and trigger a command to open the circuit breaker if the current exceeds a predetermined value the whole process says beardsall from the abnormal current being detected to the circuit breaker being opened can occur in under 100 milliseconds circuit breakers are not only used for emergencies though they can also be activated to shut off parts of the grid or equipment for maintenance or to direct power flows to different areas a single circuit breaker used within the home would typically be small enough to fit in your hand a single circuit breaker used within the transmission system may well be bigger than your home circuit breakers are a key piece of equipment in use at drax power station just as they are within your home largely unnoticed the largest power station in the uk has hundreds of circuit breakers installed all around the site a 3300 volt circuit breaker at drax power station they provide protection for everything from individual circuits powering pumps fans and fuel conveyors right through to protecting the main 660 megawatt mw generators allowing either individual items of plant to be disconnected or enabling full generating units to be disconnected from the national grid explains beardsall the circuit breakers used at drax in north yorkshire vary significantly operating at voltages from 415 volts right up to 400000 volts they vary in size from something like a washing machine to something taller than a double decker bus although the size capacity and scale of the circuit breakers varies dramatically all perform the same function  allowing different parts of electrical circuits to be switched on and off and ensuring electrical system faults are isolated as quickly as possible to keep damage and danger to people to a minimum while the voltages and amount of current is much larger at a power station than in any home the approach to quickly breaking a circuit remains the same while circuits are integral parts of any power system they would mean nothing without a failsafe way of breaking them tags drax power station  electricity  electricity generation  engineering  national grid  technology how riverpowered hydro schemes work 21 february 2020 power generation hydro power is one of the most widespread sources of electricity generation in the world  it is also one of the biggest nine of the worlds ten largest power stations are hydro powered  facilities such as the three gorges

includes a total of six power stations  glenlee tongland kendoon drumjohn earlstoun and carsfad  eight dams and a network of tunnels and pipelines giving it a capacity of 109 mw kendoon power station turbine hall there was always potential for hydro in the galloway hills but there wasnt demand for 100 mw of power explains stuart ferns operations and maintenance manager on the lanark and galloway hydro schemes however when the national grid was established in the 1920s it enabled surplus power to be transmitted beyond the local area to glasgow and further afield unlike lanark which is situated about halfway down the river clyde the galloway scheme spans the entirety of its river system from loch doon in the north to tongland in the south both however cover a similarly sized catchment area of roughly 1000 square kilometres where they do differ is in the type of hydropower they generate and the needs they serve for their regions and the wider electricity grid tongland dam lanarks power stations generate electricity through whats called runoftheriver hydropower which describes a scheme where there is no dam to stop and store water along the river instead water from a flowing river is diverted into a power station situated alongside the river here the water is used to spin a turbine connected to a generator before being returned back to the river lanarks two power stations are both positioned alongside naturally occurring waterfalls which allow them to take advantage of the natural gravitational pressure the lanark stations run constantly says om manager stuart ferns they will run as long as there is water in the river and generally there is always some water available the galloway system is different it only generates power when there are peaks in electricity demand to do this it operates a conventional storage hydro scheme where dams situated along the river are used to create small reservoirs when demand for electricity peaks  typically between 5pm and 7pm  water is released from these reservoirs and used to spin turbines and generate electricity during the day both schemes are monitored and controlled from glenlee power station halfway down the galloway route as night falls responsibility instead falls to the control room at cruachan power station  more than 200 kilometres away aroundtheclock monitoring in this way is important as the uncertainty of scotlands weather can have effects on the schemes and on their surrounding environment penstocks leading to glenlee power station working with the landscape dumfries  galloway and lanarkshire are regions defined and dominated by their river systems as such extreme weather can lead to occasional natural flooding the lanark and galloway schemes not only have to be diligent in working with extreme weather but they can actually play a role in monitoring and managing it the galloway reservoirs help to alleviate flooding because they can store water and help to alleviate flooding downstream says ferns staff at the scheme work closely with local authorities landowners and the scottish environment protection agency sepa sharing their weather forecasting and reservoir level data to help them predict which areas will be affected and when roads might need to be closed or even villages evacuated the team takes a similar approach to monitoring and protecting the local wildlife fish such as north atlantic salmon and trout migrate upstream from the ocean through the galloway rivers using manmade fish passes also known as fish ladders which allow fish to bypass dams along the scheme waterfalls on the clyde at lanark lanarks natural waterfalls mean it is not a route taken by migratory fish however ensuring there is always enough water in the rivers to protect fish and plant life factors into how both schemes operate with the landscape working with the wildlife weather and surrounding environment of the two rivers have always been a part of running the lanark and galloway schemes their continued role in the regions electricity system highlights the relevancy of smallscale hydropower even as demand for electricity grows tags electricity generation  galloway hydro scheme  hydroelectric power  lanark hydro scheme what is net zero 21 january 2020 carbon capture for ageold rivals glasgow and edinburgh the race to the top has taken a sharp turn downwards instead theyre in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first net zero carbon city in the uk while they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint track our progress at towards carbon negative   in this article weve simplified our explanation of net zero carbon dioxide co 2  is the most abundant greenhouse gas ghg it is also a longlived ghg that creates

makes a countrys electricity system stable 23 december 2019 power generation how reliable is great britains electricity system across the country electricity is accessible and safe to use for just about everyone every day widescale blackouts are very rare but they do happen on 9 august 2019 a power cut saw more than 1 million people and services lose power for just under an hour it was the first largescale blackout since 2013 although this proves the network is not infallible the fact it was such an outlier in the normal performance of the grid highlights its otherwise exemplary stability and reliability but what is it exactly that makes an electricity system stable and reliable at its core system stability comes down to two key factors a country or regions ability to generate enough electricity and its ability to then transport it through a transmission system to where its needed when everything is running smoothly an electricity system is described as being balanced  in this state supply meets demand exactly and all necessary conditions  such as voltage and frequency  are right for the safe and efficient transport of electricity any slight deviation or mismatch across any of these factors can cause power stations or infrastructure to trip and cut off power a recent report by electric insights identified the countries around the world with most reliable power systems in which the uk was fourth it offers an insight into what factors contribute to building a stable system as well as those that hold some countries back generation and reliable infrastructure according to the report france has the most reliable electricity system of any country with a population of more than five million people having gone a decade without a power outage one reason for this is the countrys fleet of 58 statecontrolled nuclear power stations which generate huge amounts of consistent baseload power in 2017 nuclear power made up more than 70 of frances electricity generation while hydropower accounted for another 10 of the 475 terawatt hours twh consumed across the county that year penly nuclear power station near dieppe france now as its nuclear stations age france is increasing its renewable power generation as these sources are often weather dependent imports from and exports to its neighbours are expected to become a more important part of keeping the french network stable at times when there is little sunlight or wind  or too much importing and exporting electricity is also key to switzerlands power system third most reliable network on the list with 41 bordercrossing power lines allowing the country to serve as a crossroads for power flowing between italy and germany it means its total imports and exports can often exceed electricity production within the country electricity pylons in switzerland switzerlands mountainous landscape also means ensuring a reliable electricity system requires a carefully maintained transmissions system the swiss grid is 6700 kilometres long and uses 40000 hitech metering points along it to record and process around 10000 data points in seconds  the key to the stability of south korea  the second most stable network on the list  is also its imports but rather than actual megawatts it comes in the form of oil gas and coal the country is the worlds fourth biggest coal importer and its coal power stations account for 42 of its total generation seoul south korea however in the face of urban smog issues and global decarbonisation goals it is pursuing a switch to renewables this can come with repercussions to stability so south korea is also investing in transmission infrastructure including a new interconnector from the east of the country to seoul its main source of electricity consumption it highlights that if decarbonisation is going to accelerate at the pace needed to meet paris agreement targets then many of the worlds most stable and reliable electricity systems need to go through significant change balance will be needed between meeting decarbonisation targets with overall system stability however there are many countries around the world that focus less on ensuring consistent stability through decarbonisation and are instead more focused on how to achieve stability in the first place stalling generation the democratic republic of congo is the eleventhlargest country on earth it is rich with minerals and resources yet it is the least electrified nation just 9 of people have access to power in rural areas that number drops to just 1 and the country suffers blackouts more than once a month as a result of load shedding when there isnt enough power to meet demand so parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to prevent the entire system failing currently the country has just 27 gw of installed electricity capacity 25 gw of which comes from hydropower  the countrys inga dam facility on the congo river has the potential to generate more electricity than any other single source of power on the planet its thought the proposed grand inga site could produce as much as 40 gw  twice that of chinas three gorges dam and provide electricity to a massive part of southern africa a legacy of political instability in the country however has so far made securing financing difficult congo river democratic republic of congo nigeria is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and with that comes rapidly rising demand for electricity however just 45 of the country is currently electrified and of these areas many still suffer outages at least once a month the country has 125 gw of installed capacity most of which comes from thermal gas stations but technical problems in power stations and infrastructure mean it is often only capable of generating as much as 5 gw to transmit on to end consumers this limited production capability means it often fails to meet demand resulting in outages the problem has been prolonged by struggling utility companies that are unable to make the investments needed to stabilise electricity supply keen to resolve what it has referenced as an energy supply crisis the nigerian government recently secured a 1 billion credit line from the world bank to improve access to electricity across the country the investment will focus in part on securing the transmission system from theft thus allowing the private utility companies to generate the revenue needed to improve generation transmission holding back emerging systems balancing transmissions systems is a crucial part of stable electricity networks maintaining a steady frequency that delivers safe usable electricity into homes and businesses is at the crux of reliability even countries that can generate enough electricity are held back if they cant efficiently get the electricity to where it is needed brazil has an abundance of hydropower installed its 97 gw of hydro accounts for more than 70 of the countrys electricity mix  however the countrys dams are largely concentrated around the amazon basin in the north west whereas demand comes from cities in the south and eastern coastline transporting electricity across long distances between generator and consumer makes it difficult to maintain the correct voltage and frequency needed to keep a stable and reliable flow of electricity as a result brazil suffers a blackout every onetothree months hydropower plant henry borden in the serra do mar brazil the country is tackling its transmissions problems by diversifying its electricity mix to include greater levels of solar and wind off its east coast  closer to many of its major cities the country has also looked to new technology for solutions at the start of the decade as much as 8 of all electricity being generated in brazil was being stolen  reaching as high as 40 in some areas these illegal hookups both damage infrastructure making it less reliable as well as blur the true demand making grid management challenging brazil has since deployed smart meters to measure electricitys journey from power stations to end users more accurately allowing operators to spot anomalies sooner electricity theft is a major problem in many developing regions with as much as 10 billion worth of power lost each year in india which suffers blackouts as often as brazil it highlights that even when there is generation to meet demand maintaining stability at a large scale requires constant attention and innovation as new challenges arise this looks different around the world some countries might face challenges in shifting from stable thermalbased systems to renewables others are attempting to build stability into newly connected networks but no matter where in the world electricity is being used ensuring reliability is an everongoing task electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent academics from imperial college london
