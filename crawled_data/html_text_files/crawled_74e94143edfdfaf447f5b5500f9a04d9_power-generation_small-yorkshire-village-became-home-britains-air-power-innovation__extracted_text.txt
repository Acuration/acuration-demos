power station how a small yorkshire village became home to britains air power innovation in october 1917 an airship set sail from a field in england and began a centurylong legacy of industrial innovation 12 october 2017 power generation picture an airship massive and slow moving it makes its way across skies its a far cry from what weve come to expect from the speed and innovation of todays air transport but go back a century and airships were not only the height of technology they were also a key part of britains aerial war effort part of this innovation can be traced back to the yorkshire village of barlow which was the site of a factory that built the vessels during the first world war three rigedstructure airships where constructed and took flight during the factorys history and this october marks the centenary of the first airship flight at the site in 1917 this is the story of how a stretch of land by the small yorkshire village near selby became the frontline for innovation in british military aviation the admiralty marches in during the first world war the german zeppelin fleet posed a very real threat to the people of britain more reliable than the aeroplanes of the time hydrogenfilled airships ability to hold heavy loads and remain airborne for periods of 20plus hours allowed them to carry out strategic bombing campaigns while the actual effectiveness of these raids on the uk mainland remains questionable the psychological impact of the zeppelins abilities to attack uk cities pushed the military to respond in early 1916 at the request of the admiralty the armstrongwhitworth airship department was formed to build zeppelinstyle aircraft to set about constructing the airship armstrongwhitworth acquired a large area of ground in barlow village within six months of the initial admiralty instructions the airship shed was completed it was the start of a century of industrial innovation in the area changing the area up until the beginning of the 20 th century barlow was almost exclusively agricultural but the construction of the selbygoole railway line changed that it suddenly connected the area as never before and enabled armstrongwhitworth to establish the 880acre airship facility along with a 700foot shed the site also included workshops offices living quarters for the workers and managers and eight huge mooring blocks for the airships it was an immediate change to the landscape but it had a greater impact than just its physical footprint between 1911 and 1951 barlow saw a 36 population increase  thought to be a result of the new military presence the first world war also began to change the demographics of the area with more than 2 million men conscripted into the army during the conflict women began to take up the traditionally maleheld industrial jobs when the war ended in november 1918 armstrongwhitworth employed 1500 people  over 1000 of those were women the airships take flight four airships were constructed over barlows lifetime as a military facility three of which made it to the air 25r the 25r first took flight on 14 october 1917 but it encountered problems from the start in the same manner as its predecessor the 23r  the craft did not have enough lift in trials subsequently dynamos bomb gear and furniture where stripped out to reduce the weight enabling the ship to make its first flight despite later stability issues the 25r served between december 1917 and september 1919 clocking up more than 221 hours of flight time and covering almost 9500 kilometres r29 armstrongwhitworths next aircraft would prove to be one of britains most successful rigedframed airships commissioned on 20 june 1918 the r29 flew for 335 hours and covered more than 13000 kilometres in its fivemonth operational career during this time the r29 encountered german uboats on three occasions while the first escaped the second struck a mine when pursued by the airship the r29 attacked and destroyed a third uboat off the coast of northumberland in september 1918 dropping two 100 kilogram bombs on the ub115 submarine and recording the only success of any british wartime riged airship r33 designs for the r33 were well underway by september 1916 when the german l33 zeppelin was brought down in essex while on a londonbombing raid despite the crews efforts to destroy the airship it fell into british hands virtually intact offering a trove of potential secrets adapted with the information learned from the downed l33 the r33 was eventually completed after the november 1918 armistice but nevertheless went on to operate for 10 years  longer than any other british riged airship httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201710r33plane_2_mp4 used with the kind permission of the airship heritage trust taking flight for the first time on 6 march 1919 the r33 was initially used to promote victory bonds around the country before being demilitarised famously the r33 was torn from its mast at pulham in a gale and blown out over the north sea  it took a partial crew 28 hours to eventually steer the damaged airship back to pulham from military camp to nature reserve following the first world war the land around barlow was sold off to civilian firms until 1938 when the thennamed war department took over the area to set up an army ordnance and command supply depot by the 60s however the uks need for military manufacturing had reduced instead with increasing demand for power and rich coal seams found there  barlow and the surrounding area became the site of what would become the uks biggest power station drax construction of drax power station began exactly 50 years after the first barlow airship took flight  and half a century ago from the present day barlow mound which held the airship construction facility is now a unique nature reserve under which drax power station can safely store the ash created from generating power and while airships may seem like relics of a longgone era of british skies the vessels could be on the verge of a resurgence the britishbuilt airlander 10  an airshipaeroplane hybrid  is the longest aircraft in the world and recently received the green light from the european aviation safety agency to start carrying out customer trials and demonstrations it can now fly at an elevation of 2136m up to 50 knots and 75 nautical miles away from its bedfordshire airfield which is located around eight miles from the proposed site of millbrook power  a drax rapid response gas project  perhaps a new golden era is on the horizon for british airships
