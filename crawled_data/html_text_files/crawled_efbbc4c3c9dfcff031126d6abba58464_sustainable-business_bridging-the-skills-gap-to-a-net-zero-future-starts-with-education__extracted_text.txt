power station bridging the skills gap to a net zero future starts with education how drax is inspiring the low carbon engineers of the future and levelling up the humber 26 august 2022 sustainable business jane breach community and education lead for drax power station key takeaways decarbonising the humber industrial cluster could create as many as 50000 new jobs  requiring a workforce skilled in the low carbon technologies draxs engagement with local education establishments is important to us as a good neighbour to communities and in bridging the emerging skills gap weve worked closely with nearby selby college to create a syllabus that will equip both current and future drax employees with skills for low carbon technologies including handson carbon capture usage and storage engineering across the uk decarbonising businesses must identify what skills their future employees will need and work with educators to deliver curriculums at drax we have a longlasting commitment to promoting science technology engineering and maths stem education in the yorkshire and humber region and beyond delivering the zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster initiatives means that we will need a highly skilled labour force to help us reach the regions goal of building the worlds first net zero industrial region  in practice this will create roughly 50000 new jobs in the region  requiring a workforce who are proficient in new and emerging low carbon technologies businesses in education we have a responsibility to be a good neighbour support education in our local area to help secure our talent pipeline and provide inspiration bruce heppenstall drax plant director lewis marron drax 4th year apprentice and liz ridley deputy principal at selby college one way were helping to develop the next generation of green economy colleagues is through our partnership with nearby selby college in 2020 we announced a 180000 fiveyear partnership with the college aimed at supporting education and skills last year we expanded our partnership even further and developed the uks first educational programmes dedicated to carbon capture working together we secured more than 270000 in funding from the government for the programme enabling the college to create a new training course in carbon capture usage and storage ccus technologies our engineers work closely with the college developing a syllabus that will equip both current and future drax employees with the vital skills needed to operate negative emissions technology this even includes a rig that mirrors the ccus equipment used in our bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot giving students the chance to work with real equipment rather than just the theory we believe that by showing students the kind of work we do onsite we can give them a deeper understanding of how we operate the department of education highlighted the success of our partnership as an example of how business and education can work together  something i believe is crucial to bridging the emerging low carbon skills gap the skills gap and future stem workers our work with selby college has highlighted the significant need to educate and upskill the uks workforce in low carbon technologies as quickly as possible although most organisations recognise the need to decarbonise they are uncertain about what they and their employees need to do to achieve this there are a lot of conversations about the need for green skills and reskilling employees in carbonintensive sectors but to put a real definition on whats needed is a lot harder every company must examine its business plan and try to unpick what skills they will need in 10 20 or even 50 years down the line  and in such a fast moving world this can prove to be a real challenge at drax were committed to building on our values  as an innovative and best in class place where we care about what matters we aim to do this by identifying training needs that are linked with new technologies beyond just beccs and working together with educators to make sure the relevant courses can either be distributed to other smes and large companies or adapted to help retrain people in other sectors our commitment to stem and education starts with young people and a handson curriculum delivered by our engineers to help support teachers we want to develop deeper more impactful education programmes that offer them multiple interactions with drax our engineers and operations throughout a persons education in my role you dont always see the immediate impact however when you start talking to people you realise that youve impacted them at some stage on their career journey that impact is whats really important to us and to building a net zero humber find
