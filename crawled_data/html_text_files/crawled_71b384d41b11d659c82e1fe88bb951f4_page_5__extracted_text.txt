how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional

and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots where the landscape makes it possible tags cruachan power station  electricity generation  energy storage  engineering  hydroelectric power  power station  sustainability  technology is there such a thing as energy terroir 16 april 2019 power generation terroir comes from the french word terre meaning land earth or soil in the french wine industry it refers to the land from which grapes are grown it is believed the terroir gives the grapes a unique quality specific to that particular growing site terroir dictates the type of wine that comes from a region  its the reason we call one bottle a bordeaux and another a côtes du rhone but could the idea of terroir hold relevance beyond just wine what if we looked at electricity in the same way certain environments are better placed to produce certain types of electricity these are some of the regions making the most of their unique location and landscape to produce electricity that makes sense for them la rance tidal barrage brittany france brittany boasts one third of mainland frances coasts and has long been a top destination for surfers with waves as high as 76 metres in some places with such tempestuous waters its the perfect location for la rance tidal power station  the worlds first station of its kind opened in 1966 the site was chosen because it has the highest tidal range in france tidal barrages like la rance harness the potential energy in the difference in height between low and high tides the barrage creates an artificial reservoir to enable different water levels which then drives turbines and generators to produce electricity while the station has been operating for close to 50 years old tidal mills are still dotted around the rance river some dating back to the 15 th century  proof that tidal power has deep roots in this region xinjiang china whilst china may have some of the worlds most polluted cities it is also the worlds biggest producer of renewable energy  including wind power with one of the largest land masses on the planet one in every three of the worlds wind turbines is in china with the government installing one per hour in 2016 in places like xinjiang  chinas most westerly province the windy weather used to be a nuisance with overturned lorries and derailed trains being a regular sight this is caused by mountain ranges between dabancheng and ürümqi which form a natural wind tunnel increasing the wind speed as air passes through these days the region is harnessing this same wind to produce incredible amounts of electricity  with 278 terwatt hours twh of electricity coming from the region in the first nine months of 2018 onshore wind farm in xinjiang xinjiang local wu gang founded goldwind to build chinas first windfarm here in the 1980s today its the worlds second largest turbine maker the turbines work on a simple premise wind turns the turbine blades which are connected to a rotor causing it to spin this in turn is connected to a generator which takes the winds kinetic energy to produce electricity hengill iceland iceland sits where the north american and eurasian tectonic plates meet meaning that magma rises close to the surface bringing with it a lot of energy potential one example of how the icelandic people are harnessing this power is the hellisheiði  the second largest geothermal power station in the world here highpressure geothermal steam is extracted from 30 wells ranging from 2000 to 3000 metres deep and is used to turn turbines and generate electricity this renewable plant has a capacity of 303 megawatts mw of electricity which is used to power the capital city of reykjavik the site was chosen due to its location in the hengill volcanic area in the south of iceland one of the most active geothermal areas on the planet here a giant magma chamber sits underground with thousands of hot springs above according to icelands national energy authority geothermal power from sites like this accounts for 25 of the countrys electricity production and 66 of primary energy usage but icelanders arent only using the geothermal landscape for energy production  chefs here can cook food simply by burying it in the ground producing delicacies like rúgbrauð  which translates as hot spring bread ouarzazate morocco from icelands belowzero temperatures to morocco a popular holiday destination for sunseekers with 330 days of sunshine a year morocco lays claim to a chunk of the sahara desert famously known as one of the hottest climates in the world where better then to situate the worlds largest solar thermal power plant noor solar thermal plant the moroccan city of ouarzazate nicknamed the  door of the desert plays host to the huge noor complex  which is still under construction and is being implemented in four parts the latest piece of the puzzle is noor iii which was hooked up to moroccos electricity grid last year  here 7400 mirrors reflect sun rays onto noor iiis tower the highest solarthermal tower in the world concentrating at the top of the building to create around 500ºc of heat this heats up the molten salts inside the tower which travel through a series of pipes creating high pressure steam this steam then moves a turbine to generate electricity molten salts are used at noor iii because they can operate at high temperatures and store heat effectively so that the site can continue to produce energy for up to 75 hours when theres no sun once up and running the plant will generate enough energy to power 120000 homes with no atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  along with the other projects at the noor complex noor iii is helping morocco to achieve its goal of obtaining 42 of its power from renewable sources by 2020 ben cruachan scotland the sun rays that shine on the noor complex are few and far between in the highlands but there are mountains aplenty  ben cruachan being one of them ben cruachan is the highest point in the argyll and bute area of scotland and is right next to the picturesque loch awe this provides the backdrop for the worlds first high head reversible pumpedstorage hydro scheme built by british engineer edward mccoll over 50 years ago cruachan power stations reservoir and loch awe viewed from the top of ben cruachan with the help of a 4000strong army of workers nicknamed the tunnel tigers  mccoll turned the slopes of ben cruachan into a geological battery which great britain still relies on today it works by using excess electricity on the national grid to pump water from loch awe at the foot of the mountain up to the cruachan reservoir 300 metres above during times of heightened demand  like when everyone puts the kettle on during a coronation street ad break or when the wind speed suddenly drops around breakfast time  this water is released back down the mountain to turn the turbines that live inside the hollowed mountain in this way cruachan power station can meet the nations energy needs within seconds whereas gas or nuclear stations would take many tens of minutes or hours to reach such capacity while ben cruachan lends itself perfectly to this pumpedstorage hydro facility it is only one of four such sites in the uk the challenge in installing more is that there are only a few sites which are mountainous with suitably large bodies of water nearby  things that are inherently necessary for pumpedstorage hydroelectricity  the growing importance of terroir all of these places embrace the land around them to produce energy in inventive ways and as levels of decarbonisation grow around the world there are an increasing number of places using whats available close to home for energy solutions take barbados  a country that has traditionally relied on imported fossil fuels for 96 of its electricity  but with short driving distances and 220 days of pure sunlight every year the government has seen the potential for electric vehicles run by solar power with modular solar carports now a regular sight in barbados the island has become one of the worlds top users of evs  preserving the picturesque landscape and reducing its dependence on imported petrol solar panels above an office car park in barbados meanwhile palau a small pacific island nation is building the worlds largest microgrid  consisting of 35 mw of solar panels and 45 mwh of energy storage for a nation threatened by rising sea levels making use of its geographic features allows it to work towards its 70 renewable energy target by 2050 and reduce its reliance on imports as more countries continue to move away from fossil fuels taking advantage of their unique terroir will increasingly enable them to produce electricity that works with their landscape tags energy storage  engineering  hydroelectric power  technology 3d to drive an energy revolution jonathan kini ceo customers 1 february 2019 opinion think of the phrase 3d and may people instantly think of video games television or cinema along with the special glasses you needed to watch it but another form of 3d is i believe going to be at the heart of the energy revolution which is rapidly gathering place the three ds in this case are data diversification and decarbonisation together they will transform the way businesses buy use and sell their energy help companies take control of their energy use and save money and also play a key part in our journey towards a zero carbon lower cost energy future were already seeing some real innovations in the energy sector our trial of a storage battery with a customer of opus energy is an example offering a farming business in northampton the chance to sell stored energy generated by solar panels back to the grid at times of peak demand  a potential new revenue stream but other innovations and advances will maintain the pace of change and data will be at the core of this now the new generation of smart meters are being installed in businesses  revolutionising customer relationships with their energy suppliers the data from the new meters will finally give customers insight into where and when they use energy suppliers will have to work much more closely with customers to help them access new opportunities for cost savings access to new markets and even new revenue streams an example would be a restaurant with the data smart meters will provide the restaurants supplier will be able to tell the owners how their energy use compares to the local competition and where improvements can be made the detail could go as far as identifying whether the restaurants equipment is older and less efficient whether rivals have installed newer kit or whether other businesses are switching off their equipment earlier or using it at different cheaper times using energy during the peak weekday morning and early evening hours is often the most expensive time to do so data will give businesses the insight into how they can use energy more efficiently and when they use it offering them the chance to avoid buying at peak times whenever possible and driving efficiencies this is why haven powers trading team is now working closely with gridbeyond  the partnership allows our customers to trade the power they produce as well as optimise their operations to help balance the grid at times of peak demand the really smart thing is that in doing so customers are reducing their energy costs and making their operations more sustainable trading desks at haven powers ipswich hq the way demand changes and is managed by businesses and consumers on a diversified power system will also be key the business energy sector is already diversifying as many customers are able to generate and store their own power but the next step is for more customers to be paid to reduce their usage at peak times think of a busy time for the national grid  half time in the fa cup final or after the results in strictly come dancing previously the grid would have to pay a power station to ramp up generation to meet demand but these days customers are paid to reduce demand for 30 minutes or so  in effect becoming a huge virtual power station  this has happened for some time of course with larger industrial customers but now smaller companies can benefit from this too thanks to the data and insight they will have from their smart meters this empowers customers and puts them not the energy companies in control of the key decisions about their energy a close advisory relationship between energy suppliers and their customers will become ever more important to make sure business can choose to avoid the high demand periods and maximises use during the lower cheaper times in fact i can see a time when customers will end up paying more for insight and advice than they do for the power they buy  and theyll save money overall in doing so and if we get all this right it will help drive one of the most important of the three ds  decarbonisation sustainability is increasingly becoming a primary focus for businesses and demand for renewable energy is growing because it is now costeffective that will help us in our drive towards a zero carbon future as more and more renewable energy comes onstream though the uk will continue to need power generated from more flexible assets as well so there are huge opportunities out there to transform our energy landscape but they have to be viewed positively the smart metering programme can be viewed as a regulatory burden or it can be seen as an opportunity we take the positive view likewise batteries were once the preserve of massive companies only but now as technology develops they are becoming available for smaller firms too the more we can innovative on a larger scale the more the technology will work its way into smaller markets too adding momentum to the energy revolution the opportunities are huge if we get it right so too will be the benefits to one of the biggest priorities of all  the work to decarbonise the uk and create the lower carbon future we all want tags customers  electricity  energy policy  national grid  smart grid  sustainability  technology electricity and magnetism the relationship that makes the modern world work 30 january 2019 power generation locked in a parisian vault and stored in a double set of bell jars is a small cylinder of metal made of platinumiridium the carefully guarded lump weighs exactly one kilogram but more than just weighing one kilogram it is the kilogram from which all other official kilograms are weighed international prototype kilogram with protective double glass bell known as the international prototype kilogram or colloquially as le grand k the weight was created in 1889 and has been carefully replicated to offer nations around the world a standardised kilogram but over time le grand k and its clones have slightly deteriorated through wear and tear despite extremely careful use in an age of micro and nanotechnology bits of metal arent quite accurate enough to dictate global weighs and so as of may this year it will no longer be the global measurement for a kilogram  an electromagnet is part of its replacement an electromagnet is effectively a magnet that is turned on by running an electric current through it cutting the current turns it off while increasing or decreasing the strength of the current increases and decreases the power of the magnet it can be used to measure a kilogram very precisely thanks to something called a kibble balance which is essentially a set of scales however instead of using weights it uses an electromagnet to pull down one side because the electric current flowing through the electromagnet can be increased decreased and measured very very accurately it means scientists can define any weight  in this case a kilogram  by the amount of electrical current needed to balance the scale  this radical overhaul of how weights are defined means scientists wont have to fly off to paris every time they need precise kilograms beyond just replacing wornout weights however it highlights the versatility and potential of electromagnets from their use in electricity generation to creating hard drives and powering speakers the simple way to make a magnet magnets and electricity might at first not seem closely connected one powers your fridge the other attaches holiday souvenirs to it the former certainly feels more useful however the relationship between magnetic and electric fields is as close as two sides of the same coin they are both aspects of the same force electromagnetism electromagnetism is very complicated and therere still aspects of it that are unknown today  it was thinking about electromagnetism that led einstein to come up with his theory of special relativity  however actually creating an electromagnet is relatively straightforward all matter is made up of atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons spinning around them these electrons have a charge and a mass giving the electrons a tiny magnetic field  in most matter all atoms are aligned in random ways and effectively all cancel each other out to render the matter nonmagnetic but if the atoms and their electrons can all be aligned in the same direction then the object becomes magnetic a magnet can stick to an object like a paperclip because its permanent magnetic field realigns the atoms in the paperclip to make it temporarily magnetic too  allowing the magnetic forces to line up and the materials to attract however once the paper clip is taken away from the magnet its atoms fall out of sync and point in random directions cancelling out each others magnetic fields once again whether a material can become magnetic or not relies on a similar principal as to whether it can conduct electricity materials like wood and glass are poor conductors because their atoms have a strong hold over their electrons by contrast materials like metals have a loose hold on their electrons and so are good conductors and easily magnetised nickle cobalt and iron are described as ferromagnetic because their atoms can stay in sync making them a permanent magnet but when magnets really become useful is when electricity gets involved putting magnets to work running an electric current through a material with a weak hold on its electrons causes them to align creating an electromagnetic field because of the relationships between electric and magnetic fields the strength of the electromagnet can also be altered by increasing or decreasing the current while switching the flow of the current will flip its north and south poles having this much control over a magnetic field makes it very useful in everyday life including how we generate electricity find out how we rewind a generator core in a clean room at the heart of drax power station inside each of the six generator cores at drax power station is a 120tonne rotor  when a voltage is applied this piece of equipment becomes a massive electromagnet when steam powers the turbines to rotate it at 3000 rpm the rotors very powerful magnetic field knocks electrons in the copper bars of the surrounding stator out of place sending them zooming through the metal in turn generating an electrical current that is sent out to the grid the 660 megawatts mw of active power draxs unit 1 can export into the national transmission system is enough to power 13 million homes for an hour beyond just producing electricity however electromagnets are also used to make it useful to everyday life almost anything electric that depends on moving parts from pumping loud speakers to circuit breakers to the motors of electric cars depend on electromagnets as more decarbonisation

climate change as not being ambitious enough  a committee of mps has suggested 2032 becomes the official target date for banning new petrol and diesel cars  rather than 2040 called for in the strategy even as the range of evs on the market grows getting more lowemission vehicles on roads will require incentives and infrastructure improvements heres how some of the countries leading the shift to electrified transport are driving adoption expanding charging infrastructure one of major barriers to ev adoption is a lack of public charging facilitates coupled with reliability issues across a network that includes both old hardware and a plethora of apps and different connections  no one wants to set off on a long journey unsure of whether theyll be able to find a recharging point before their battery goes flat according to the energy revolution report there is one charger for every 5000 people in the uk compared to one for every 500 people in norway the leading country for charging points the scandinavian countrys government has invested heavily in its policy of placing two fast charging stations for every 50 km of main road covering 100 of the cost of installation government support has also been crucial in second and third ranked countries the netherlands and sweden respectively the dutch living lab smart charging is a collaboration between government and private organisations to use wind and solar to change vehicles while sweden has combined its klimatklivet investment scheme for both public and private charge points with experiments such as charging roads  china where half of the worlds 300000 charge points are located has issued a directive calling for the construction of 48 million electric charging points around the country by 2020  its also assisting private investments to make charging stations more financially viable the uks road to zero strategy is to expand charging infrastructure through a 400 million joint investment fund with private investors draxs energising britain report found the uk is on track to meet its 2030 target of 28000 installed chargers ahead of time however deployment still clusters around london the south east and scotland more direct government incentives or policies may be needed to balance this disparity and in the uk the scottish government is leading the pack with a 2032 ban on new petrol and diesel cars plus a range of initiatives including public charging networks and the switched on towns and city fund  charging points are necessary for electrified roads however its a chickenandegg situation more chargers dont mean more evs getting more evs on roads also requires financial incentive money makes the wheels go around putting infrastructure in place is one thing but the reality is evs are expensive especially new ones and cold hard cash is an important driver of adoption financial incentives have been a part of norways policies since the 1980s with the countrys high fuel prices  compared to the us for example further helping to make evs attractive current benefits for ev owners include no import or purchase taxes no vat no road tax no road tolls half price on ferries and free municipal parking there are also nonfinancial incentives such as buslane usage sweden the second ranked country for new ev sales in 2018 is a similar case where high fuel prices are combined with a carrotandstick approach of subsidies for evs and rising road taxes for fossil fuelpowered vehicles including hybrids the uk has had a grant scheme in place since 2011 but last year removed hybrid vehicles from eligibility and dropped the maximum grant for new ev buyers from 4500 to 3500  evs are also exempt from road taxes in april 2019 transport for london is implementing a low emissions zone ulez which exempts evs from a daily charge subsidies for both buyers and vehicle manufacturers have been a cornerstone of chinas policies with support coming up to around 15000 per vehicle  chinese ev buyers can also skip the lottery system for new license plates the country has in place to reduce congestion heavy subsidies have allowed the country to claim as much as 50 of the entire ev passenger market however it makes change expensive and the government is now preparing to find a more sustainable way of driving adoption preparing for transport beyond subsidies china isnt afraid to strongarm manufacturers into building more evs companies with annual sales of more than 30000 vehicles are required to meet a quota of at least 10 evs or hybrids  however the government has begun to scale back subsidies in the hope it will drive innovation in areas such as batteries robotics and automation which will in turn reduce the price for end consumers norway which owes so much of its decarbonisation leadership in lowcarbon transport to subsidies is also grappling with how to move away from this model as evs creep increasingly towards the norm the taxes lost through evs exclusions become more economically noticeable while the government says the subsidies will remain in place until at least 2020 different political parties are calling to make the market commercially viable  there is also concern the schemes only pass on savings to those who can afford new ev models  rather than the wider population who face higher taxes for being unable to upgrade its not just governments responsibility to make new markets for evs sustainable but for business to innovate within the area too drax group ceo will gardiner recently said his company must help to  ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution  thats a view welcomed by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum concerned not just about mitigating manmade climate change but also to ensure a just transition during the economys decarbonisation energy and clean growth minister claire perry spoke at an aldersgate group event in london in january its been very easy in the past for concerns about the climate to be dismissed as the worries of the few not the many luckily weve been able to strip out a lot of the myths surrounding decarbonisation and costs but we have to be mindful that this is a problem which will have to be solved by the many not just the middle class many countries have set ambitious targets for when the ban of new petrol and diesel vehicles will come into effect government

calculator in the early sixties it estimated that such a complicated device might require a battery as big and powerful as a cars  with some innovative thinking the team were eventually able to power the device with just a fivevolt battery turning the calculator into a truly handheld device and kickstarting an electronics efficiency revolution continuous advances in the space mean that todays superpowered smartphones run on more efficient powerful  and smaller  sources than ever before but as more of our devices become smart and grow in usage their electricity demand is also increasing on the other hand many bigger objects that traditionally have used a lot of power are becoming more efficient and consuming less electricity than before the small devices eating up electricity think of the most electricityintensive appliance in a home something constantly running like a fridgefreezer might come to mind  or something intensive that operates in short blasts like a hairdryer or kettle however a surprising drain of electricity in homes is tv settop boxes and consoles which as recently as 2016 were reported to account for as much as half of all electricity usage by domestic electronics  this is because of how often they are left in standby mode which means they are constantly using a small amount of electricity in 1999 the international energy agency iea introduced the one watt initiative which led to the electricity consumption of many devices on standby falling from around five watts to below one watt and while this has helped reduce standby or vampire power multiplied across the country  the electricity consumption becomes significant  in the uk there are an estimated 27 million tvs this is not just a tvspecific problem however it is symptomatic of many of the modern devices increasingly found in our homes  from smart lightbulbs to amazons alexa these are constantly using small amounts of electricity listening and connecting to the cloud even when not being directly used in 2014 the iea estimated that by 2020 these networkeddevices could result in 120 billion in wasted electricity  adding to this is the increasing demand of the cloud and data storage which has been estimated could account for 20 of the worlds electricity consumption by 2025  previous alarm bells surrounding the bitcoin networks electricity usage highlights that its not just physical connected objects that will put increasing pressure on electricity supply but also entirely digital products yet even as little things become smarter and require more electricity some big things that have previously consumed huge amounts of electricity are becoming more efficient the big things becoming more efficient buildings are a big source of electricity demand globally office blocks full of lights and blasting heating and airconditioning units are among the main offenders but poorly insulated homes that leak heat also have a significant impact efforts are constantly being undertaken to reduce this via technological means such as companies generating their own electricity onsite from installed renewables  but cutting interstitial demand to a minimum doesnt always have to be hitech the bullitt centre in seattle is a 50000 ft 2 office aiming to be the greenest commercial building in the world this is achieved in part through a rooftop solar array that allows the building to generate more electricity than it consumes but is complimented by more straightforward steps such as maximising natural light and ventilation collecting rainwater and the use of geothermal heat pumps on average the building consumes 230000 kilowatthours kwhyear compared to the average of 1077000 kwhyear for seattle offices retrofitting can also make notable reductions to energy usage and new york artdeco icon the empire state building has been updated to consume 40 less electricity  this is largely thanks to straightforward renovations such as ensuring windows open properly and temperatures can be easily controlled energy efficiency is even extending beyond the confines of the planet the international space station only consumes about 90 kw to run which comes from a solar array stretching more than 2400m 2  when its solar panels are operational about 60 of their generation is used to refill batteries for when the station is in the earths shadow the mars desert research

sustainability  technology the renewable pioneers 18 january 2019 power generation people love to celebrate inventors its inventors that apples famous 90s tv ad claimed think different and in doing so set about changing the world the renewable electricity sources we take for granted today all started with such people who for one reason or another tried something new these are the stories of the people behind five sources of renewable electricity whose inventions and ideas could help power the world towards a zerocarbon future the magicians hydro house water wheel by the side of the trail to the power house at cragside rothbury northumberland using rushing rivers as a source of power dates back centuries as a mechanised way of grinding grains for flour the first reference to a watermill dates from all the way back to the third century bce  however hydropower also played a big role in the early history of electricity generation  the first hydroelectric scheme first came into action in 1878 six years before the invention of the modern steam turbine  what important device did this early source of emissionsfree electricity power a single lamp in the northumberland home of victorian inventor william armstrong this wasnt the only feature that made the house ahead of its time water pressure also helped power a hydraulic lift and a rotating spit in the kitchen  while the house also featured hot and cold running water and an early dishwasher one contemporary visitor dubbed the house a palace of a modern magician the first commercial hydropower power plant however opened on vulcan street in appleton wisconsin in 1882 to provide electricity to two local paper mills as well as the mill owner hj rogers home after a false start on 27 september the vulcan street plant kicked into life in earnest on 30 september generating about 125 kilowatts kw of electricity it was very nearly americas first ever commercial power plant but was beaten to the accolade by thomas edisons pearl street plant in new york which opened a little less than a month earlier the switch to silicon that made solar possible when the international space station is in sunlight about 60 the electricity its solar arrays generate is used to charge the stations batteries the batteries power the station when it is not in the sun for much of the 20 th century solar photovoltaic power generation didnt appear in many more places than on calculators and satellites but now with more largescale and rooftop arrays popping up solar is expected to generate a significant portion of the worlds future energy its been a long journey for solar power from its origins back in 1839 when 19year old aspiring physicist edmond becquerel first noticed the photovoltaic effect the frenchman found that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution created an electric current  he did not however have any explanation for why this happened american inventor charles fritts was the first to take solar seriously as a source of largescale generation  he hoped to compete with thomas edisons coal powered plants in 1883 when he made the first recognisable solar panel using the element selenium however they were only about 1 efficient and never deployed at scale it would not be until 1953 when scientists calvin fuller gerald pearson and daryl chapin working at bell labs cracked the switch from selenium to silicon that the modern solar panel was created bell labs unveiled the breakthrough invention to the world the following year using it to power a small toy ferris wheel and a radio transmitter fuller pearson and chapins solar panel was only 6 efficient a big step forward for the time but today panels can convert more than 40 of the suns light into electricity  the wind pioneers who believed in selfgeneration offshore wind farm near øresund bridge between sweden and denmark like hydropower wind has long been harnessed as a source of power with the earliest examples of windpowered grain mills and hydro pumps appearing in persia as early as 500 bc the first electricitygenerating windmill was used to power the mansion of ohiobased inventor charles brush the 60foot 183 metres wooden tower featured 144 blades and supplied about 12 kw of electricity to the house charles brushs wind turbine charged a dozen batteries each with 34 cells the turbine was erected in 1888 and powered the house for two decades brush wasnt just a wind power pioneer either and in the basement of the mansion sat 12 batteries that could be recharged and act as electricity sources small turbines generating between 5 kw and 25 kw were important at the turn of the 19 th into the 20 th century in the us when they helped bring electricity to remote rural areas however over in denmark scientist and teacher poul la cour had his own grander vision for wind power  la cours breakthroughs included using a regulator to maintain a steady stream of power and discovering that a turbine with fewer blades spinning quickly is more efficient than one with many blades turning slowly he was also a strong advocate for what might now be recognised as decentralisation  he believed wind turbines provided an important social purpose in supplying small communities and farms with a cheap dependable source of electricity away from corporate influence in 2017 denmark had more than 53 gigawatts gw of installed wind capacity  accounting for 44 of the countrys power generation the prince and the power plant larderello italy italian princes arent a regular sight in the history books of renewable energy but at the turn of the last century on a tuscan hillside piero ginori conti prince of trevignano set about harnessing natural geysers to generate electricity in 1904 he had become head of a boric acid extraction firm founded by his wifes greatgrandfather his plan for the business included improving the quality of products increasing production and lowering prices but to do this he needed a steady stream of cheap electricity in 1905 he harnessed the dry steam which lacks moisture preventing corrosion of turbine blades from the geographically active area near larderello in southern tuscany to drive a turbine and power five light bulbs  encouraged by this conti expanded the operation into a prototype power plant capable of powering larderellos main industrial plants and residential buildings it evolved into the worlds first commercial geothermal power plant in 1913 supplying 250 kw of electricity to villages around the region by the end of 1943 there was 132 megawatts mw of installed capacity in the area but as the main source of electricity for central italys entire rail network it was bombed heavily in world war two following reconstruction and expansion the region has grown to reach current capacity of more than 800 mw globally there is now more than 83 gw of installed geothermal capacity  the engineer who took on an oil crisis with wood compressed wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit drax biomass port facility on the mississippi river while sawmills had experimented with waste products as a power sources and compressed sawdust sold as domestic fuel  it wasnt until the energy crisis of the 1970s that the term biomass was coined and wood pellets became a serious alternative to fossil fuels as a response to the 1973 yom kippur war the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries opec placed oil embargoes against several nations including the uk and us the result was a global price increase from 3 in october 1973 to 12 in march 1974 with prices even higher in the us where the countrys dependence on imported fossil fuels was acutely exposed  one of the most vulnerable sectors to booms in oil prices was the aviation industry to tackle the growing scarcity of petroleumbased fuels boeing looked to fuelefficiency engineer jerry whitfield  his task was to find an alternative fuel for industries such as manufacturing which were hit particularly hard by the oil shortage and subsequent recession this would in turn leave more oil for planes wood pellets from morehouse bioenergy a drax biomass pellet plant in northern louisiana being unloaded at baton rouge transit for storage and onward travel by ship to england whitfield teamed up with ken tucker who  inspired by pelletised animal feed  was experimenting with fuel pellets for industrial furnaces the pelletisation approach combined with whitfields knowledge of forcedair furnace technology opened a market beyond just industrial power sources and whitfield eventually left boeing to focus on domestic heating stoves and pellet production one of the lasting effects of the oil crisis was a realisation in many western countries of the need to diversify electricity generation  prompting expansion of renewable sources and experiments with biomass cofiring since then biomass pellet technology has built on its legacy as an abundant source of lowcarbon renewable energy with largescale pellet production beginning in sweden in 1992 production has continued to grow as more countries decarbonise electricity generation and move away from fossil fuels since those original pioneers first harnessed earths renewable sources for electricity generation the cost of doing so has dropped dramatically and efficiency skyrocketed the challenge now is in implementing the capacity and technology to build a safe stable and lowcarbon electricity system tags electricity  electricity generation  sustainability  technology what causes power cuts 16 january 2019 power generation on the night of 5 december 2015 61000 homes and properties across lancaster were plunged into darkness storm desmond had unleashed torrents of rain on great britain causing rivers to swell and spill over with waters rising to unprecedented levels the river lune began threatening to flood lancasters main electricity substation the facility where transformers step down electricitys voltage from the transmission system so it can be distributed safely around the local area to prevent unrepairable damage the decision was taken to switch the substation off cutting all power across the region lights phones internet connections and atms all went dead across the city it would take three days of intensive work before power was restored it was a bigger power outage than most but it offers a unique glimpse into the mechanisms behind a blackout  not only how theyre dealt with but how theyre caused what causes blackouts in great britain flooded electricity sub station in lancaster sunday 6 december 2015 when the lights go out a common thought is that the country has run out of electricity however a lack of electricity generation is almost never the cause of outages only during the miners strikes of 1972 were major power cuts the result of lack of electricity production rather than meeting electricity demand power cuts in great britain are more often the result of disruption to the transmission system caused by unpredictable weather if trees or piles of snow bring down one power line the load of electric current shifts to other lines  if this sudden jump in load is too much for the other lines they automatically trip offline to prevent damage to the equipment this in turn shifts the load on to other lines which also then trip potentially causing cascading outages across the network last marchs beast from the east  which brought six days of near subzero temperatures deep snow and high winds to great britain is an example of extreme weather cutting electricity to as many as 18000 people  highwinds brought trees and branches down onto powerlines while ice and snow impacted the millions of components that make up the electricity system engineering teams had to fight the elements and make the repairs needed to get electricity flowing again lancaster was different however with the slow creep of rising rainwater approaching the substation the threat of long lasting damage was plain to see in advance and so rather than waiting for it to autotrip authorities chose to manually shut it down getting reconnected an emergency generator brought from london is reversed into position adjacent to the sub station in bold street morecambe near lancaster monday 7 december 2015 electricity north west is lancasters network operator and after shutting down the substation it began the intensive job of trying to restore power on monday 7 december two days after the storm hit the first step of pumping the flooded substation empty of water had finally been completed and the task of reconnecting it began to begin restoring power to the region 75 large mobile generators were brought from as far away as the west country and northern ireland and hooked up to the substation allowing 22000 customers to be reconnected once partial power was restored the next challenge lay in repairing and reconnecting the substation to the transmission network while shutting the facility had prevented catastrophic damage some of the crucial pieces had to be completely replaced or rebuilt after three days of intensive engineering work the remaining 40000 properties that had lost power were reconnected preventing blackouts in a changing system the cause and scale of lancasters outage were unusual for great britains electricity system but it does highlight how quickly a power cut may arise in a time of transition when the grid is decarbonising and the network is facing more extreme weather conditions because of climate change it could create even more new challenges coal is scheduled to be taken entirely off the system after 2025 making the country more reliant on weatherdependent sources such as wind and solar  potentially increasing the volatility of the system on the other hand growing decentralised electricity generation may reduce the number of individual buildings affected by outages in the future solar generation and storage systems present on domestic and commercial property may also reduce dependency on local transmission systems and the impact of disruptions to it the cables and poles that connect the transmission system will always be vulnerable to faults and disruptions however by preparing for the future grid great britain can reduce the impact of storms on the electricity
