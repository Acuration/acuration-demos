press releases harry shann now 83 was part of the team who worked at drax power station 50 years ago constructing the 850ft high chimney which has three flues linked to the sites six generating units four of which now run on sustainable biomass instead of coal the chimney took just four months to build after work started in early 1969 and was completed four months ahead of schedule by a team of around 30 workers with the topping out ceremony held in may to celebrate its completion now harry who was just 33 when he joined the project and still lives locally in selby has spent time back at the drax site to reflect on his involvement in the recordbreaking construction project he said i still see it pretty much every day it was definitely the highest build i ever worked on im very proud of it even after all these years and i can still remember the time i spent on site considering the size of it though we werent there long we really got a move on due to the height of the structure reaching the top can only be achieved by an eightminute journey in an industrial lift or by scaling the 1460 steps spiralling up the central void of the chimney views from the top can stretch as far as the humber bridge more than 30 miles away on a clear day  and harry admits it was only a job for those who were comfortable working high above the ground i just never had a fear of heights i was in the parachute regiment before i became a scaffolder so that might have had something to do with it the octogenarian said on his return visit to view the huge structure he helped to create being back at drax power station i realise just how much its changed when i worked here looking down from the chimney the area was bare with hardly any buildings now its just amazing its a wonderful site and i feel proud that the chimney is still standing 50 years later the north yorkshire power station which first began generating electricity in 1974 when the first of its six generating units was commissioned now produces enough electricity to supply five per cent of the uks power and is the biggest decarbonisation project in europe drax power ceo andy koss said harrys efforts along with his colleagues in building such an important and iconic part of the power station are an integral part of draxs history and ongoing success 50 years on it is still the tallest industrial chimney in the uk  in many ways its completion marked the start of a rich heritage for engineering excellence and innovation at drax which has continued to the present day earlier this year drax confirmed that its groundbreaking trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs using technology developed by leedsbased ccapture had become the first project of its kind in the world to capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock drax has converted twothirds of its generating units at the site near selby to use sustainable biomass instead of coal transforming the business to become the largest renewable power generator in the uk ends chimney facts drax chimneys foundations are 70ftdeep the 44000 tonne chimney cost around 1 million to build its almost twice the height of the great pyramid of giza the record for the highest

and europes biggest decarbonisation project has successfully converted four of its six generating units to run on sustainable biomass instead of coal delivering carbon savings of more than 80 per cent its innovative beccs project started capturing carbon dioxide earlier this year and could transform drax which supplies 12 of the uks renewable energy into the worlds first negative emissions power station this would play a vital role in helping the uk to meet its climate change obligations if the beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced the uk committee on climate changes net zero report stated that the country needs carbon capture usage and storage technologies and hydrogen developed in regional industrial clusters if it is going to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050 andy koss drax power ceo who met with the minister and the team from the treasury officials said we are delighted to welcome robert jenrick and the team from the treasury to drax drax is the biggest renewable power generator in the country and has played a vital role in helping the uk to decarbonise faster than anywhere else in the world our beccs pilot project could enable drax to go further to become the anchor for a new zero carbon economy in the humber region delivering for the environment and the wider uk economy we are proud of our contribution to the regions economy and are committed to supporting future growth across the northern powerhouse drax supports more than 5700 jobs in the north of england and generates over 600 million for the northern powerhouse economy exchequer secretary to the treasury robert jenrick mp said the uk is a world leader in tackling climate change and we have reduced our reliance on carbon faster than any other g20 country since 2000 but we will need new innovative technologies to further

contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 notes to editors drax announced in february that is has started to capture carbon dioxide from its beccs pilot project using technology developed by leeds university spinout company ccapture this is the firsttime carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100 biomass feedstock anywhere in the world since starting its innovative beccs pilot project drax has been talking to several industries about using its co 2 in their processes this could be to produce concrete within the food and drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hardtodecarbonise sectors like aviation it has set up a dedicated incubation area at the power station that will give other technology companies the opportunity to test their processes on its carbon dioxide if the beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 mt co2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero the cccs net zero report also identified that at least one of the uks ccus regional clusters should involve substantial production of lowcarbon hydrogen by 2030 to stay on track for net zero it also recommends that infrastructure development for ccus should start as early as possible in all regional clusters with large industrial emissions today drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its pilot  once scaled up it could be capturing 16 million tonnes of

it comes to education and skills leading to a serious skills shortage for employers we want to change that with initiatives like this one pupils from selby abbey primary school meet lord prescott prior to their race stacey cannon a teacher at selby abbey primary whose pupils named their car the cannon in her honour said im really proud of them all and the effort they have put in to this and im proud to see the car out there with my name on it i think they have grown so much through this especially in relation to the stem subjects weve taught all subjects for the past few weeks by using the car and as a teacher it will hopefully open their minds to the world of engineering ends media contacts mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email protected t 07969080272 jessica gorton drax group

16 new charging points and is initially replacing 10 of its 120 strong fleet of diesel vans with electric vehicles the switch will result in a carbon saving of 43 tonnes of co 2 per year and is another significant step forward in ses waters environmental commitments which last year saw the company switch to 100 per cent renewable electricity the comprehensive service provided to ses water by haven power part of drax group includes charging infrastructure and operating software the leasing of evs supporting devices such as vehicle telematics and the renewable electricity needed to power the vehicles drax which is the biggest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses in the uk will also supply ses water with telematic systems to allow usage data from the trial to be monitored paving the way for a broader roll out plan and potential vehicle to grid trials at ses water henrietta stock energy and carbon manager at ses water said every day we use enough energy to power 13000 homes so we are always looking at ways to balance the environmental impact of our essential activities and support the investment in renewable generation in the uk we have already significantly reduced our carbon emissions over the last year and working with drax has enabled us to create a bespoke ev solution so we can understand exactly how to save the most energy further lowering both our carbon emissions and our costs the service drax is providing includes expert advice to determine what kind of vehicles and systems will work best for customers analysis of different charging methods to minimise fleet downtime as well as data to help companies use their fleet efficiently jonathan kini drax retail ceo said we know from supplying energy to our customers that no two businesses are alike so a one size fits all approach wont deliver what they all need instead we are working with customers like ses water as an energy partner to offer each of them a solution tailored to their
