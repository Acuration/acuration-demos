Press Release
On pawtrol: Sparky the Robodog enhances safety at UK’s largest renewable power station
27 September 2023
Press releases

The robodog has joined Drax’s Condition Based Maintenance team to spot potential failures on the plant before they happen. The bright yellow dog is fitted with a camera which enables it to conduct critical visual and thermal inspections on equipment such as hot boilers while its human controllers are kept safe away from the equipment.
As Sparky gets familiar with the plant, he will be programmed to follow tailored routes around the site. This will enable him to operate autonomously, enhancing efficiency even further.
Ensuring the safety, health, and wellbeing of people on site is the company’s top priority. Drax’s investment in Sparky is part of a wider drive to improve safety standards across the company’s global operations.
Richard Barber, Maintenance Systems Lead Engineer, said:
“A robotic dog might not be what you have in mind when you think about safety, but Sparky is a real game changer for us. The technology enables our team to collect better information about our equipment, while also keeping our colleagues out of harm’s way.
“Its optical panoramic camera allows us to zoom in-depth on equipment and it is fitted with a thermal infrared camera, which means we can see any hot spot or unusual thermal anomalies on the machinery. We want to prevent faults from happening, not simply repair them when they occur. With Sparky on patrol at the power station, we will be able to do just that.”
Sparky will have plenty of room to roam around, with Drax Power Station being one of the country’s largest industrial sites. The plant near Selby has four operational power generating units, each as high as a 15-storey office block, a main chimney nearly as tall as the London Shard, and more than 1,800 miles of steel tubing, enough to stretch from John O’Groats to Land’s End and back again.
The four-legged friend is the brainchild of Boston Dynamics, an American engineering and robotics design company which started as a spin-off from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Sparky is part of the Spot pedigree of robodogs from the firm.

Drax Foundation funds new £150k grant to help schools become more energy efficient
19 September 2023
Press releases

The new funding will enable Bath-based Energy Sparks to ensure that up to 240 schools across the UK have free access to its online energy management tool, education programme and support services. This includes schools in the areas of the country where Drax Group operates: Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, East of England and Scotland.
The charity currently works with more than 1,000 UK schools to help them reduce their energy use and carbon footprint.
Shona King, Head of Community at Drax Group, said:
“We are proud that this new grant will help Energy Sparks engage many more schools and pupils across the UK in reducing their energy use and costs as well as fighting climate change. Alongside our existing grant funding for LED lighting and solar panels, we are excited to bring Energy Sparks’ energy analysis tool and education programme to more schools in and around the communities where we operate.
“It’s important to us to help children start thinking about saving energy and reducing their carbon footprint from a young age as these issues are going to be increasingly important for them in the future.”
Dr Claudia Towner, CEO and Programme Director at Energy Sparks, said:
“We are delighted to receive this funding from the Drax Foundation, it means we can reach even more schools and pupils, and remove financial barriers to ongoing engagement for some of the existing schools using our services.
“Our work equips children and young people with the knowledge, skills, and tools to take measurable action in their school and wider community to reduce carbon emissions. We also enable school leaders, staff and communities to better understand and reduce their school’s energy consumption, save money and introduce wider measures to reduce their carbon footprint.”
Energy Sparks was founded in 2020 and, in the last year, through Energy Sparks’ tools, the average primary school it works with has saved at least £3,000 in energy costs and 12.8 tonnes of CO2, additionally, the average secondary school has saved at least £12,000 and 48 tonnes of CO2.
Energy Sparks’ education activities encourage pupils to learn about climate change and why reducing carbon emissions is important, investigating energy use around the school site, taking action to reduce energy use and spreading the energy saving and carbon reduction message across their wider school community.
Energy Sparks’ online tool presents bespoke analysis of the energy data with suggestions of actions the school community could take to save energy and reduce the school’s carbon emissions.
This new funding is drawn from a pot of £1.5m that Drax Foundation
unveiled earlier this year
for UK schools to install energy-efficient LED lights and solar panels, and deliver energy saving monitoring and education.

Scottish Energy Minister calls on UK Government to support new pumped storage hydro plants
16 August 2023
Press releases

Mr Gray gave his backing to the industry while visiting Drax’s iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station near Oban in Argyll, where the renewable energy giant is progressing plans to build a new £500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at the site. Expanding the UK’s pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid, enhancing the nation’s energy security while tackling climate change.
Pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it.
Despite the critical need for them, no new plants have been commissioned in the UK since 1984, with existing support schemes for other technologies unsuitable for the unique needs of these large-scale infrastructure projects. A
report
by KPMG found that a cap and floor mechanism, like the regime used to incentivise investment in cross-border interconnectors, could overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said:
“To achieve a safe and secure net zero power grid, we need to have a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants to balance our grid.
“As the UK increasingly relies on intermittent renewables to keep our lights on, there is a growing need for flexible power sources to plug the gap when the wind doesn’t blow, or the sun doesn’t shine. With its reversible turbines, Cruachan can also store excess power from Scotland’s wind turbines when they are generating more renewable electricity than we need, helping to stop valuable green power from going to waste.
“With the right support from the UK Government, Drax will invest £500m to more than double Cruachan’s generating capacity and support almost 1,000 jobs across the supply chain during construction.”
Scottish Government Energy Secretary Neil Gray MSP said:
“Scotland is a global leader in the production of renewable energy, which will play an increasingly important role in the transition to a net zero electricity system by 2045.
“However, pumped hydro storage, an important low carbon technology, is currently ineligible for UK Government support. UK Government inaction on this issue represents a significant obstacle to progress and risks failing to secure economic benefits, such as creating thousands of good quality, green jobs.”
Earlier this year, a
report
commissioned by the influential trade body Scottish Renewables found that a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants in Scotland could create almost 15,000 jobs across the UK, with Drax’s Cruachan expansion generating almost half a billion pounds for the UK economy.
Drax acquired Cruachan alongside the Galloway and Lanark hydro schemes in 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, renewable power generation.

Editor’s Notes:
Drax
applied for development consent
from the Scottish Government under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 in May 2022.
The plans
received consent
through the Section 36 process in July 2023.
The UK Government has
pledged
to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in large-scale, long-duration storage projects by 2024.
A report by
KPMG
for Drax found that a Cap & Floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently.
No investment decision has yet been taken by Drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other considerations.

About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
Drax’s around 3,000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties. For more information visit
www.drax.com
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in England and Scotland. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is also where Drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology BECCS within its CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) Incubation Area.

Drax delivers funding for 25 community projects across the UK
15 August 2023
Press releases

The £35,200 of funding, donated between April and June this year, has gone to projects that provide STEM education and skills development, enhance green spaces or improve communities.
Jane Breach, Drax UK Community Manager, said:
“As part of Drax’s commitment to being a good neighbour in the communities where we operate, we are delighted to announce this quarter’s donations for 25 community-based organisations including Lindsey Lodge Hospice and Brayton Youth Connect. These groups make a tangible difference to people’s lives and help us make a positive impact on people, nature and the climate in our communities.”
In the previous quarter, Drax donated to groups including PlayStillingfleet, who look after the Stillingfleet playground, for new play equipment, and Hensall Village Hall, to help fund a new boiler. Both sites are in the vicinity of North Yorkshire’s Drax Power Station.
Ross Powell, Chair at PlayStillingfleet Community Group, said:
“The funding has allowed us to successfully deliver the final phase of our playground project. The playground has quickly become a focal point for children and parents to come together and build the next generation of friendships in the village.”
David Hardaker, Treasurer at Hensall Village Hall, said:
“The new boiler has been installed thanks to the generosity of the Drax Community Fund plus local support via a concert which raised £490.
“Without Drax’s support the outcome would have been so much different. We are now looking forward to a warm space in the winter that will ensure that all our groups continue and hopefully expand. Until Drax intervened so generously we were looking at closure, without a doubt.”
Drax’s Community Fund provides donations of £500-£2,000 for community-led projects. In addition, the Drax Foundation was launched in March this year to award larger grants of up to £50,000 for established non-profit organisations. In addition to the Drax Community Fund, we also provide larger grants of up to £50,000 through the Drax Foundation.
Organisations and initiatives that meet Drax’s
funding and selection criteria
are encouraged to visit

Drax boosts education and skills with work experience placements
14 August 2023
Press releases

The programme gives students the opportunity to work alongside highly trained staff, observe practical tasks and ask questions to improve understanding and help them decide if a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) is right for them. Students who took part could choose from a variety of business areas including engineering, IT, finance, and facilities.
Dylan Baines
, who is in Year 10 at school, spent a week at Drax Power Station working with colleagues in the trading department. Dylan was already familiar with Drax having built a car with the Drax Green team in Primary School that won a race in Hull for his school and for Drax.
He said: “I chose to do my work experience at Drax because I was recommended it and I know that it is a very successful company where the staff are very helpful and supportive.”
“I’m very interested in engineering and fixing machines and getting my hands dirty. I know that Drax has a very good engineering department, and they are always looking for new people and always trying to help people as much as they can.”
Polly Whyley
chose to work in the logistics team, learning all about the company’s supply chain and how Drax is able to generate enough power for millions of homes and businesses.
She said: “I chose to do my work experience at Drax because it seemed like a very interesting place to work- I thought it was the kind of place that I may not ever get the opportunity to visit again and that I should take the chance to see what it was like.”
“I am planning to study Physics at university and coming to Drax has made me consider a career in the energy sector. I had not previously known the variety of STEM roles required in the area.”
Bobby Rodger
, spent a week shadowing engineers in the maintenance team. Bobby, whose dad Mike works in Operations at Drax Power Station, said:
“I have really enjoyed my time at Drax. I feel it has helped me grow in confidence from meeting all the new people and have learned a lot about teamwork and safety. It has really inspired me to push on at school and try to achieve the grades I need to achieve.
“I feel as though I have made friends at Drax and really felt welcomed straight away and felt the team had planned in advance for my arrival with many things to do and see. The team were lovely and involved me in everything all week.”
Oliver McNiff,
who also did a week’s work experience with the logistics team, said:
“I personally chose Drax Power Station for my work experience because I am trying to take engineering courses when I am older and hopefully have a career in the design engineering front. I live near drax so I knew a lot about what the company did and thought, There was no better place for engineering than Drax.”
“I found the work experience very informative and fun. My week was very engineering based and we went everywhere from looking at how train companies modify their wagons to eliminate any potential faults to viewing the massive fleets and logistics side of things.”
Prior to attending the in-person work experience, all students completed an induction day, which introduced them to career opportunities at Drax and gave them the opportunity to improve their employability skills, through activities such as CV coaching and interview practice. They were also able to meet and network with potential managers and senior leaders.
Bruce Heppenstall
, Plant Director, said:
“We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire young people from all backgrounds to study STEM subjects. It’s important that the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours in new fields like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, also known as BECCS, as we continue to decarbonise.
“We’re pleased to be able to offer in-person work placements at our sites and hope that this will give students a valuable insight into the world of work and spark an interest in STEM subjects.”
Drax is welcoming 45 work experience students across its sites in the UK, including Cruachan Power Station in Scotland. At the end of the week, each student will be presented with a certificate of achievement and a £100 Amazon voucher to spend on books and educational resources.
Drax runs a variety of initiatives to support STEM education and skills including offering
power station tours
and running
interactive workshops
for students. This includes initiatives supported by the Drax Foundation, launched earlier this year, which funds initiatives that support STEM, as well as those that improve green spaces and enhance biodiversity within local communities.
