hydro scheme near dumfries produces 100 renewable power accredited under the renewable energy guarantees of origin rego scheme 24 march 2022 renewable energy giant drax has signed an agreement with allied glass to provide 66gwh 100 renewable electricity per year from one of draxs run of river hydroelectric schemes located in scotland the corporate power purchase agreement cppa allows allied glass to use hydrobacked renewable energy guarantee of origin rego certificates to support its carbon reduction goals linked to the generation at the galloway hydro scheme the cppa means that allied glass can state with authority where their energy is sourced from and will help the business to further reduce its carbon emissions  already down by more than 10 since 2015 the galloway hydro scheme generates renewable power in response to rising electricity demand helping to provide grid stability dating back to 1935 the galloway complex was the first large scale integrated hydroelectric power scheme to be built in britain located in rural southwest scotland it comprises six power stations 12 turbines eight large dams 16km of tunnels and pipelines five fish passes 22 bridges and four pumping stations generating 126mws of renewable electricity  enough to supply 70000 homes valpy fitzgerald director of renewables and sustainable commodities at drax said were delighted to partner with allied glass to provide them with 100 renewable source power as well as renewable energy guarantees of origin regos from our galloway hydro scheme renewable energy is increasingly important to organisations as they look for ways to decarbonise  and being on supply with our 100 renewable source power is a simple first step our galloway cppa presents another opportunity for our customers to demonstrate their environmental social and governance esg credentials while making significant progress towards achieving net zero alan henderson ceo at allied glass said we chose to source our renewable power from draxs galloway hydro scheme as knowing exactly where our electricity comes from helps us continue towards our 2025 sustainability targets we work closely with our suppliers to ensure that the materials and resources we use are sustainable renewable electricity is very much part of that process were very happy that we can say our operations are powered by 100 renewable electricity its important for us as a business to be able to operate with a low impact on the environment electricity and renewable certification from drax helps us to demonstrate that to our customers which is becoming more important ends picture caption one the galloway hydro schemes eight dams in carsfad notes to editor a corporate power purchase agreement cppa is an energy contract for businesses that want to purchase renewable electricity directly from a specific producer and location while power purchase agreements ppa are made between a power generator and third party such as an energy supplier cppas allow organisations to contract directly with a power generator to provide longterm support of a specific source of renewable electricity the contract with allied glass spans 30 months and will see drax provide 66gwh per annum of renewable electricity media contacts ben wicks media manager e email protected t 07762 525 661 about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate capacity of 46mt which will increase to c5mt once developments are complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers drax is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses supplying 100 renewable electricity as standard to more than 370000 sites through drax and opus energy it offers a range of energyrelated services
