archives press release drax enters formal discussions with uk government on largescale power beccs 30 march 2023 press releases drax power station and gb power supplies at risk in the late 2020s without government support for beccs 21 march 2023 press releases new research highlights the critical contribution that biomass could play in late 2020s as coal plants and nuclear fleet close down drax pauses uk beccs investment in 2023 as it awaits clarity of governments commitment to its project without government support for beccs drax power station could become unviable in 2027 baringas research shows that by 2027 peak demand for gb electricity will increase by 4gw but at the same time the imminent closure of coal older gas generation and nuclear power stations will remove up to 63gw of secure capacity from the grid this will mean that the dispatchable capacity which supports gb energy security will fall from 93 to 85 at times of peak demand increasing the risk of a supply shortfall the system will need to rely on other forms of capacity such as electricity interconnectors and intermittent renewable generation like wind or solar to make up the 15 difference at times of peak demand or steps may need to be taken to reduce consumption such as through voluntary demand reduction or forced turndown draxs power station in yorkshire is currently the largest provider of dispatchable power to the gb electricity system as well as being one of the only renewable sources of secure supply its renewable biomass generation provides 26gw of electricity supplying millions of homes and businesses with dispatchable reliable power whilst drax welcomed the governments support for ccs in the recent budget it needs its beccs project to gain track 1 status without which drax power station may become unviable and unable to contribute secure power at a time of such critical need until it receives this clarity drax has taken the decision to pause its multimillionpound investment programme into the beccs project at drax power station at times with the tightest margins draxs biomass units provide up to 11 of total gb electricity generation and up to 70 of the renewable generation the loss of draxs and other biomass units from the gb electricity system would further reduce the countrys dispatchable capacity to 80 of peak demand from the already forecasted fall to 85 increasing reliance on gas and power imports generation from intermittent renewables and increasing costs for consumers drax ceo will gardiner said whilst we welcome the governments ambition to invest billions in carbon capture and storage we need a firm commitment to beccs before we commit to investing 2bn into installing this technology at drax power station until we have this clarity we are pausing our multimillion pound investment programme in the uk beccs project and urge government to use the planned announcement at the end of the month to outline their support for this any further delays to this project could impact the uks security of supply net zero and levellingup ambitions and the viability of drax power station the research also found that by 2027 no established technology can feasibly replace the security of supply provided by draxs 26gw of biomass capacity without significantly increasing carbon emissions and relying more on imported fossil fuel from europe it goes on to state that meeting decarbonisation targets without the carbon removals provided by draxs beccs units will be more expensive and difficult and would require accelerating decarbonisation in challenging sectors such as heating industry and road transport the report concludes that it is more cost effective and lower risk to keep existing biomass open than to build additional new build or retrofit gas ccs capacity ends media contacts chris mostyn head of media relations  pr e  email protected t 07548 838896 editors notes the baringa research is available here

industry renewable power sources  wind solar biomass and hydro  generated 40 of the countrys electricity in 2022  up from 35 in 2021 helping to cut co 2 emissions from the power sector by 27 million tonnes compared to the previous year overall generation from renewables has more than quadrupled over the last decade at one stage during may renewables provided 728 of power to the grid whilst wind farms generated a landmark 20gw of electricity for the first time  the maximum output from wind is now up by a third compared to four years ago  despite the record supply of cheap renewable electricity the unprecedented rise in the cost of gas following russias invasion of ukraine sent power prices to a new alltime high the fossil fuel supplied 42 of the countrys power this year its largest share of the fuel mix since 2016  britain is on course to have annual average wholesale price above 200 per mwh for the first time ever in 2022  up from 113 the year before this is nearly six

and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said this has been a year like no other for the energy industry the public are feeling the pain of high gas prices on their energy bills even though renewables are providing the grid with more cheap green electricity than ever before the lesson from 2022 is that we need to break our addiction to fossil fuels once and for all if we want lower cost and more secure energy supplies if we had not invested in wind solar and biomass over the last decade our energy bills would have been even higher as would the risk of blackouts

electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants shows that the uks gas reduction yearonyear was outpaced by germany france italy and spain  with demand for gas actually rising in britain in september compared to previous years change in natural gas consumption versus the previous three years in uk and comparable european countries data covers all sectors excluding power generation and are not adjusted for weather differences what reduction there was in gas use in the uk was attributable to unseasonably warm weather rather than people adjusting their behaviour the analysis for drax electric insights showed that from september through to end of november britains gas demand was just 03 lower than would have been expected preenergy crisis when accounting for weather anomalies daily natural gas consumption in uk versus expectations the blue line shows the seasonal average for all end users except power generation over 10 years to 2020 the yellow line adjusts for weather showing what demand would be with precrisis behaviour the black line shows actual consumption dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report said the uk is an outlier on the world stage showing no signs of reducing its appetite for gas during a time of dramatically higher prices if temperatures continue to drop during the festive season managing the energy crisis will be both more difficult and expensive unless people and businesses break their addiction to gas turning the thermostat down by just 1c would save households up to 200 a year on their energy bills and save the uk from importing 50twh of natural gas over the winter  cutting the cost of the governments energy price guarantee by 3bn on the continent national governments have introduced demand reduction measures alongside information campaigns to inspire the public and businesses to act in germany public buildings have turned down their thermostats to 19c and outside illuminated advertising must be turned off between 10pm until 6am the uk government has now launched a public information campaign on how people can claim financial support this winter alongside more technical advice on how to reduce energy use while still keeping warm such as reconfiguring boiler settings this followed the chancellor announcing a further 6bn to insulate homes and upgrade boilers  penny small draxs group generation director said as a result of russias war in ukraine the uks energy system is under considerable strain this winter and the combination of rising inflation and gas prices has put most household budgets under pressure britains longterm energy security will be strengthened by ending our reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels such as gas and instead increasing investment in homegrown renewables and innovative green technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and pumped storage hydro drax is the uks biggest renewable power producer by output generating enough renewable electricity from biomass and hydro for around 5 million homes it plans to invest billions of pounds expanding its pumped hydro storage capacity at its cruachan power station in scotland and also deploying beccs at its power station in north yorkshire to permanently remove 8million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030 ends media
