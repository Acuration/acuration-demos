power station global collaboration is key to tackling the climate crisis the need for thinking that transcends borders will create opportunities for governments and businesses to tackle the climate crisis says drax ceo will gardiner will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2021 opinion leaders from 40 countries are meeting today albeit virtually as part of president joe bidens leaders summit on climate  the event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change set a clear pathway to net zero emissions while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition since taking office president biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the united states back into the paris agreement ahead of the twoday summit he announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target and new nationally determined contributions the us joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per year sending it for secure storage permanently locking it away deep under the north sea experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy it would also act as an anchor project for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to create the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the humber region and more than 200000 around the uk in 2039 additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south and western canada a global company as a britishnorth american company drax embodies the positive impact that clean energy investments have we directly employ 3400 people in the us canada and the uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax is strongly committed to supporting the communities where we operate by investing in local initiatives to support the environment jobs education and skills from the working forests of the us south and western canada to the yorkshire and humber region and scotland we have a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 at drax we believe the challenge of climate change is an opportunity to improve the environment we live in we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 and transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the rest of the world  a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green economic recovery if we are to reach the targets set in paris global leaders must lock in this opportunity and make this the decade of delivery share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the
