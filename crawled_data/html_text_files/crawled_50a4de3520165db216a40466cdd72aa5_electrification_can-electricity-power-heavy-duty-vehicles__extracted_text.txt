on a blackedout stage a blast of white light appears smoke floods out music blares and an excited crowd surges forward smartphones held aloft its a moment of rapture  but this is not a theatrical or musical performance this is the launch of an electric car specifically the launch of teslas new electric roadster  which claims to be the fastest production car ever made and while the sportscar may have been the undoubted star of the event it wasnt the only one unveiled tesla also launched an electricpowered articulated lorry  the semi with governments around the world setting ambitious plans to ban the sale of petrolanddieselonly cars  the introduction of electricpowered utility vehicles  like teslas truck  in a range of industries will be essential to a truly decarbonised transport system disrupting trucking teslas heavy goods vehicle hgv highlights the growing capabilities of electric vehicles evs to deliver more than just short urban journeys it claims its semi will be able to travel 500 miles on a single charge enough to get you from london to edinburgh comfortably and tow 40 tonnes of cargo tesla isnt the only player with electric big rig concepts  los angelesbased thor trucks  daimler and volkswagen have unveiled their own  but its ambitious 2019 production target makes it a more immediate possibility than any other in the space despite media coverage claiming the semis megacharging capability breaks the laws of physics  big business is taking a sunny view of elon musks latest innovation walmart which has been taking strides to reduce its emissions has already preordered 15 of the semis  delivery firm ups has used small electric trucks in major cities for some years already  it has placed the largest order so far for 125  electrifying emergency response in the world of emergency services quick response is vital evs then which have fast acceleration and are quick off the mark are ideal candidates to deliver  especially as battery technology becomes more reliable and durable health services in nottingham have already been trialling electricpowered fast response vehicles while in japan nissan has unveiled an allelectric ambulance that carries a lithiumion auxiliary battery to power medical equipment on board this onboard power supply is a further advantage of evs and one not just restricted to emergency services electric pickup truck maker havelaar for example offers power outlets on its bison vehicle for electric tools the future of battery farming out in the countryside evs are making waves in farming john deere has unveiled plans for fully electric tractors claiming they require less maintenance and have a longer lifecycle than combustion engines  with more than a third of uk farms generating their own power from solar wind and even anaerobic digestion using farm byproducts theres potential for farmers to charge tractors renewably and cut their fuel and charging costs more than just helping cut emissions and costs there can also be performance benefits given their acceleration abilities electric tractors are well suited to heavy pulling without revving up engines and churning up ground joining hgvs and tractors in their ability to apply almost instant torque to heavy industrial jobs are edumper trucks the komatsu quarry truck weighs in at almost 45 tonnes and claims to be the biggest ev in the world the economic advantage of electrification air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are the main driving force behind many antifossil fuel regulations however research suggests decarbonising transport systems also have economic advantages for businesses a report by financial services firm hitachi capital found that switching vans and heavy goods vehicles hgvs to electric or other alternative fuels could save british businesses as much as 14 billion a year it claims evs run at 13p cheaper per mile than dieselfuelled vans while hgvs are reported to be 38p cheaper that adds up to total savings of 137 billion a year if all britains commercial vehicles were switched the move to a fully electrified transport system is already underway the number of registered electric cars increased by 280 in the uk over the past four years according to the hitachi report the chinese city of shenzhens entire fleet of 16359 buses has gone electric  a transition that began in 2009 and has been assisted by an 80 drop in the cost of a lithiumion battery pack according to bloomberg new energy finance  chinas need for electric bus batteries is almost on a par to that of all global ev battery demand china could be said to be driving the market evs are undoubtedly cleaner when it comes to roadside pollution however the exponential increase in evs will only benefit the fight against man made climate change if countries entire energy systems continue to decarbonise  emissionsfree vehicles will need to be powered predominantly by low carbon electricity for a more electric future to be a sustainable one share
