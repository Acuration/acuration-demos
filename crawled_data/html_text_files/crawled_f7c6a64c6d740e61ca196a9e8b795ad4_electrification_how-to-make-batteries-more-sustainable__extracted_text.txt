can be found everywhere in our houses in our cars and vans and even in the tech we wear more than just being pervasive battery technology has enabled a huge amount of technological breakthroughs  from the increasing distances electric vehicles can travel between charges to being able to store renewable electricity for when its needed these two developments in particular  emissionfree electric transport and gridscale batteries that can power homes businesses and cities even when energy sources are not generating  could be two key aspects in the transition to a zero carbon energy future however questions remain around batteries environmental impact whats in our batteries the batteries we use every day are typically made from a mix of metals and chemicals such as lead and acid as found in petrol and dieselengine cars or zinc carbon nickel and cadmium which make up some of the batteries found in the home then theres lithiumion the goto material mix for the rechargeable batteries powering mobile phones laptops and more recently a high proportion of electric vehicles around the world the surge in the production of lithiumion batteries over the last decade has led to an 85 price reduction  which in turn has encouraged the use of these reliable batteries in electric vehicles and largescale energy storage solutions while this is a positive step in the development of rechargeable goods it raises issues in the handling of spent batteries each year around 600 million batteries are thrown away in the uk alone  even rechargeable batteries have a shelflife while recycling allows the safe extraction of raw materials for use in other industries and products the majority of discarded batteries are left to rot in landfill sites this can lead to their chemical contents leaking into the ground causing soil and water pollution for batteries of any size to play a role in a sustainable future an overhaul is needed in preventing harmful levels of battery waste  the battery problem although the number of batteries that are recycled has increased currently the eu puts the recycling efficiency target for a lithium battery at only 50 of the total weight of the battery  connecting positive and negative terminals on a rechargeable lithium mobile battery standard recycling methods achieve this by separating and processing the plastics and wiring that make up the bulk of the battery pack then smelting and extracting the copper cobalt and nickel found within the cell releasing carbon dioxide in the process crucially these recycling practices do not typically recover the aluminium lithium or any of the organic compounds within the battery meaning that only around 32 of the batterys materials can be reused a lack of recycling facilities in the uk means spent batteries have traditionally been exported overseas for treatment upping emissions even further it is not only spent batteries that cause a problem the creation of them can be harmful too for example lithium mining can pose health hazards to miners and damage local communities and their environments in one area of chile 65 of available water is used in the production of lithium for batteries meaning water for other uses such as maintaining crops must be driven in from somewhere else impacting farmers greatly there are also risks around contaminated water leaking into livestock and human water supplies as well as causing soil damage and air pollution as a result teams across the globe are working to make the production and recycling of batteries more efficient and ecofriendly switching materials researchers based at chalmers university of technology in sweden and the national institute of energy in slovenia are developing an aluminiumion battery  this type of battery offers a promising alternative to lithiumion due to the abundance of aluminium in the earths crust and its ability in principle to carry charges better than lithium disassembling the battery from an electric vehicle ev the reduction in material and environmental costs that come with using aluminium over lithium might mean batteries made with it could offer more affordable largescale storage for renewable installations while more research is still needed to reduce the size and control the temperature of aluminium batteries researchers believe they will soon enter commercial production and eventually could replace their lithiumion predecessors elsewhere ibm researchs battery lab is developing a sustainable battery solution made predominantly of materials extracted from seawater a composition that would avoid the concerns associated with the production of lithiumion cells while the exact combination of materials in not public battery lab claims the new concept has outperformed its lithiumion counterpart in energy density efficiency production costs and charging time making good of the old along with advancements in battery development new recycling methods are also reducing the environmental impact of batteries german company duesenfeld  is innovating the recycling of lithiumion batteries used in electric vehicles through an innovative new process  batteries are first discharged and disassembled into their constituent parts the metals are extracted with a waterbased solution the liquid chemicals evaporated and condensed and the dry materials crushed and separated ready for reuse importantly duesenfelds method avoids incineration reducing the carbon footprint of lithiumion battery recycling by 40 and enabling over 90 of the batteries materials to be salvaged and reused in new batteries fortum  a finnish energy company is exploring a similar process  with the potential to recycle more than 80 of battery materials including cobalt manganese and nickel this year fortum signed a deal with german chemical company basf and russian mining and smelting firm nornickel to develop a renewablepowered electric vehicle battery recycling cluster in finland the aim is to create a closedloop battery production and recycling system meaning materials from recycled batteries would be used to make new batteries while it is clear there is a long way to go in reducing the environmental impact of battery production and recycling continued development of both batteries and technology can pave a path for a cleaner safer batterypowered zero carbon future electric vehicle battery pack ev fast facts from electric insights  electric vehicles evs on roads in great britain  including ev vans  emit on average just one quarter the carbon dioxide co 2  of conventional petrol and diesel vehicles if the carbon emitted in making their battery is included this rises to only half the co 2 of a conventional vehicle evs bought last year could be emitting just a tenth that of a petrol car in four years time  as the electricity system continues to decarbonise share related stories press releases drax acquires leading uk ev charge point
