governments clean growth strategy and the opportunities it gives both drax and the businesses we supply to play an important part in delivering clean growth we are already seeing decarbonisation in industry  the proportion of businesses choosing to use renewable electricity supplied by haven power part of drax group has more than tripled this year reducing the carbon emissions from these businesses by 76 compared to five years ago  saving almost 15 million tonnes of carbon we now need to work with these customers to use the information from smart technologies to fuel future decarbonisation and help them to become even cleaner and more sustainable flexible technologies like draxs biomass and gas are vital in supporting the governments strategy as todays plan makes clear biomass generation is crucial because its a reliable flexible renewable available at scale able to provide the full range of support services the grid needs to retain stable supplies  whatever the weather our biomass with the rapid response gas power plants were developing will support the system and enable more intermittent renewables to come online helping us to further decarbonise share most
