power station experts issue weather warning for britains electricity grid get serious about the threat of extreme weather says electric insights quarterly author dr iain staffell 24 may 2021 uks energy system must prepare for onceinadecade prolonged periods of little wind and reduced daylight report warns recent blackouts in texas show the danger of overlooking extreme weather risks britain needs more flexible and longerterm storage from pumped storage hydro not just batteries to plug the gap britains everchanging weather could put its landmark net zero climate target at risk and become a threat to the power grids security unless policymakers take action a new report has warned the independent report by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants shows the uk experienced its longest spell of low wind output in more than a decade during the first quarter of this year output from the countrys 244 gigawatt gw wind turbine fleet fell to as low as 06 gw on 3 march in sharp contrast to the 181 gw delivered later that month grid operators had to overwhelmingly call on gasfired units to generate power to plug the gap with the report finding every gigawatt of falling wind output being replaced by 084 gw of gas  harming britains carbon cutting ambitions periods of reduced generation from intermittent renewables cause strain on electricity systems with the phenomena recognised in germany as a dunkelflaute  a dark wind lull the event at the start of march was the longest dunkelflaute that britain has experienced in the last decade with 11 straight days of low wind output britains wind farm capacity factor over the past six months highlighting times when it fell below 20 for more than a day click to viewdownload the report warns that britain could expect to face prolonged lowwind periods on average every 20 years making them a key challenge to the countrys energy security it says the recent widespread blackouts in the us state of texas highlights the cost of overlooking extreme weather risks to energy systems dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights report said its time for britain to get serious about the threat of extreme weather events to our electricity system renewable power sources have made our country cleaner and greener but as they rely on the everchanging british weather completing our transition away from fossil fuels comes with serious challenges dr malte jansen of imperial college london coauthor of the report added with wind and solar power set to supply half our electricity needs in the next five years these extreme events will become much more impactful to bridge the gap and deliver a net zero energy system the uk needs to invest in much more clean and flexible technologies such as long duration energy storage pumped storage hydro power stations act like giant water batteries storing excess energy when there is an oversupply of power and then releasing when the country needs it most despite being a key supporting pillar for intermittent generation from wind and solar power no new pumped storage plants have been built in britain since 1984 renewable energy leader drax group is progressing plans to develop a second underground power station at its existing cruachan pumped storage hydro plant in scotland drax group ceo will gardiner said a new generation of pumped storage hydro power stations will allow the uk decarbonise faster and cheaper drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload these water batteries soak up surplus power from wind and solar farms and then release it to plug gaps during extreme weather events innovative storage projects like draxs plans to expand cruachan are essential to delivering a net zero electricity system but we need the right investment framework from policymakers for it to become a reality the drax electric insights report found the uks pumped storage hydro power stations set a new daily average output high during the first quarter of this year underlining their increased importance for keeping the power grid stable ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07712670888 editors notes the report found the uk is almost entirely reliant on using gas to plug the gap when wind power does not deliver with every gw of lost wind output being replaced by 084 gw of gas click image to viewdownload the report pdf or alternatively read the report webpage here  between the 26 february and 8 march the capacity factor of the national wind fleet did not go above 20 wind farm output fell to as low as 06 gw on 3 march biomass units generated a record amount of renewable power during the period with 383 gw supplied to the grid on 7 january based on longer records of historical wind speed data from renewablesninja a project codeveloped by drax electric insights lead author dr iain staffell the march dunkelflaute could be expected roughly once every 20 years in britain pumped storage hydro power stations set a new daily output average high of 409 mw during the first quarter of 2021 drax is progressing plans to expand its existing hollow mountain cruachan pumped storage hydro plant in scotland a separate independent report by academics from imperial college london recently found that just 45 gw of new pumped storage hydro could save up to 690m per year in energy system costs by 2050 about electric insights electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the quarterly report analyses raw data made publicly

to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 3400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage hydro facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax supplies energy to 250000 businesses
