millbrook power is a drax group project to build and operate a rapid response gasfired power station on land located on the rookery south pit near the villages of stewartby millbrook and marston moretaine in bedfordshire the project received planning consent on 13 march 2019 millbrook power station could run up to a maximum of 2250 hours in any given year provided that the fiveyear rolling average does not exceed 1500 hours it will provide backup to other sources of electricity including weatherdependent renewable and low carbon technologies such as wind turbines and solar farms about millbrook power about millbrook power the power generation plant would be situated within rookery south pit and would cover an area of approximately 20 acres the power station would enter commercial operation by october 2024 millbrook power plant will have the capacity to generate up to 299 mw providing enough instant electricity to power 150000 households it will operate as a peaking plant generating electricity at times when the countrys need is greatest detailed technical and environmental studies were carried out in 201314 a series of public exhibitions were held in 2014 to share details of the project and receive feedback from people living in the local area in addition the project team have met local councillors a number of times to discuss plans and have provided local residents in the area with updates on the project and the planning process improvements to aspects of the project were made as a result of local dialogue under the ownership of drax group the millbrook power project recommenced in december 2016 during the course of 2017 further studies were undertaken and a 35day period of statutory public consultation was held in the early part of the 2017 summer on 23 october 2017 an application for a development consent order dco was submitted to the planning inspectorate between december 2017 and january 2018 further consultation was carried out on the application documents and members of the public and statutory consultees were invited to make a representation about the project and register to participate in the examination process a public examination of the application commenced on 13 march 2018 and concluded on 13 september and involved many participants including the local councils the independent examining authority that led the examination made its recommendation to the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy on 13 december 2018 an environmental permit under the environmental permitting england and wales regulations 2016 was granted on 25 january 2019 the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy granted consent on 13 march 2019  his decision is published on the planning inspectorates website the project the project the proposed project site in rookery south pit is located approximately 2 km to the east of the a421 which connects directly to junction 13 of the m1 motorway approximately 6 km to the south west of the project site the rookery grid ref 501373 240734  and therefore the power plant site was previously worked for clay used in the nearby stewartby brickworks until its closure in 2008 to the north of the rookery some of the buildings associated with the brickworks remain standing including the chimneys which are now listed the main elements of the proposed project would comprise a new open cycle gas turbine ocgt power peaking plant also known as a simple cycle gas turbine designed to provide up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity the plant could run up to a maximum of 2250 hours in any given year provided that the fiveyear rolling average does not exceed 1500 hours following consultation in 201415 and additional technical work the plant will now incorporate a single gas turbine generator with one exhaust gas flue stack a temporary laydown area required during construction and an access road from green lane near stewartby a new electrical connection including underground cables to export electricity from the plant to the national grid electricity transmission system this element incorporates a new circuit connection to the existing 400 kilovolt kv overhead transmission line and a new substation the decision to place the connection underground rather than as an overhead line with transmission towers was made in 2014 and was shared with the local community it was an outcome of local consultation and informed by additional technical studies a new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the plant from the gas national transmission system which is located approximately 18 km from the project site this element incorporates an above ground installation agi located offsite at the southeastern end of the pipeline in june 2019 an application was submitted to make changes to the millbrook gas fired generating station order 2019 this application was submitted as work alongside national grid identified that a gas insulated switchgear gis substation would be more efficient economical and smaller than the original proposal of an air insulated switchgear aig this change did not fundamentally alter the proposals and drax was granted a nonmaterial change order by the secretary of state in april 2020 to amend the plans as well as being more economical and efficient the gis substation will also result in a much smaller footprint moving to a gis system means we are able to reduce the length of the substation by 100 metres and the width by 90 metres allowing for additional planting of vegetation and removing the need for a temporary transmission tower given its capacity size of 299 mw the project required a development consent order dco from the secretary of state for business energy  industrial strategy planning  consultation planning  consultation public consultation has been an integral part of the planning process and has been an important element of millbrook powers work since the project was first announced in 2014 the projects consultations with the local community local politicians local groups and other relevant organisations have met all legal requirements and have been based on a range of advice and guidance there have been several opportunities to consider and comment on the project phase 1 consultation 2014 nonstatutory consultation started in june 2014 and included three exhibitions held locally to introduce the project to people living in close proximity to it this was followed by a period of statutory consultation in octobernovember 2014 during which public exhibitions were held in marston moretaine stewartby ampthill and lidlington along with meetings with local parish councils and councillors from central bedfordshire council and bedford borough council phase 2 consultation 2017 a second period of statutory consultation was carried out between 29 may and 2 july 2017 public exhibitions were again held in marston moretaine stewartby ampthill and lidlington to update people living in close proximity to the project and introduce it to anyone who did not participate in the 2014 consultation during phase 2 consultation meetings were held with various local representatives statutory consultees and other stakeholders  these meetings constituted both statutory and nonstatutory consultation statements of community consultation the projects 2014 socc was agreed with central bedfordshire council and bedford borough council and a revised statement of community consultation for 2017 was also agreed with the local councils both the 2014 and 2017 soccs were published in the local press and made available via this website the socc and other information about the project was also made available at the councils offices and local libraries during both phases of consultation commitments commitments millbrook power is a power generation project that can help support the uks future energy security and ensure that the country meets its low carbon emission targets  all efforts will be made to ensure minimum impact on the environment during its construction and operation environment the environmental impact assessment eia of the proposed development was submitted as part of the suite of documents that accompanied the application for development consent the eia examined likely significant environmental effects of the millbrook power project issues such as noise air emissions ecology visual impact archaeology and transport have been considered under the eia regulations a revised preliminary environmental information report was made available for the 2017 consultation process feedback from the 2014 and 2017 consultations helped inform the detailed eia for the millbrook power project the eia was a central part of the application for development consent and will inform the planning inspectorates recommendation and the secretary of states decision community benefit the millbrook power project can bring a range of benefits to the area during both construction and operation construction will take around two years and will provide job opportunities for up to 150 skilled and semiskilled people this investment will also support indirect jobs in the local community in areas such as facility maintenance and other support services a detailed socioeconomic impact study has been submitted as part of our planning application opportunities local businesses and individuals with an interest in working at the plant either during its construction or operation that would like

questions frequently asked questions site location  environment q1 why do you want to build at rookery south pit a1 after various studies across the country over a fouryear period we consider rookery south pit to be an ideal site it has three key advantages  close proximity to the national gas and electricity distribution networks  location in national grids strategic area for new electricity generation  rookery south pit is a brownfield site allocated for development by central bedfordshire council q2 what steps will you take to preserve the local environment a2 every effort will be made to minimise the projects impact on the local environment both during its construction and operation its design and the steps to mitigate its impacts such as screening and landscaping has formed a major part of the consultation and planning process we have chosen to reduce the number of exhaust gas flue stacks from five to one and we will underground the electrical connection so the projects visual impact is reduced this is also helped by siting the project in a pit q3 where will the gas pipeline and electricity connections be routed a3 the proposed routes are underground a decision taken as a result of millbrook powers preliminary environmental impact assessment and consultation with the local community and key stakeholders further information is available in the 2014 preliminary environmental information report peir or peir nontechnical summary nts here  q4 is this part of the covanta energy from waste development a4 millbrook power has no connection with covanta the covanta project is to build an energy from waste power project on land next to our site that project was consented in 2010 and some preliminary works on their site have started our projects environmental and technical assessments have taken the covanta project into account and provide a clear assessment of the cumulative likely significant environmental effects of both projects q5 what about the cumulative impact of having both power projects a5 the cumulative impact assessment of both projects has been fully addressed in millbrook powers application for development consent q6 how bignoisy will the plant be a6 the site for the power plant and electricity substation within rookery south pit covers an area of approximately 20 acres or 8 hectares there will be a single stack in the power plant the stack height will be up to 35m from the bottom of the pit no significant effect from noise is expected the noise produced during operation of the power plant will be strictly limited by the requirements of the development consent order which will be enforced by the local authority and limits set by the environment agency ea noise modelling was undertaken to ascertain the current background noise levels and the typical noise levels from a gas fired plant have been modelled on top to determine the likely impacts the results of these assessments were included in the eia emissions to air will be strictly monitored and regulated by the environment agency through an environmental permit which is required for the plants operation photomontages of the power plants site from various viewpoints were shown at the exhibitions that were held in the summer of 2017 and were included in the dco submission q7 will there be an increase in road traffic a7 there will be hgv traffic during the twoyear construction phase but it would be routed to minimise congestion noise and dirt in the local area once operational there will be a negligible increase in traffic movements q8 is it going to smell a8 the combustion of natural gas in a power station does not produce any noticeable odour q9 will there be any emissions from the power station a9 a plume consisting mainly of water vapour may be visible from the stack of the power station but only under certain atmospheric conditions cold and dry with high pressure this is not smoke the emissions from the stack will be strictly limited by the environment agency ea as part of an operational environmental permit and will not have any significant effect on people or the environment the stack will also emit some carbon dioxide co 2  however millbrook power station will only be permitted to run up to a maximum of 2250 hours in any given year provided that the fiveyear rolling average does not exceed 1500 hours this would be at times when lower carbon forms of power generation are not available due to intermittency or high demand such as when there is not enough wind sun at peak times or on very cold days q10 has millbrook power ltd built a gasfired power station elsewhere a10 millbrook power ltd is the name of the project company it is owned by drax group drax is enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan drax owns and operates four gas power stations in england and as well as millbrook power station is developing three other rapidresponse gas power plant projects in england and wales two of which have already secured planning consent and are moving forward to the engineering and construction phase for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk q11 will the project affect the bedford brickworks project what about construction disruption the bedford brickworks project was announced by property company cloud wing in 2019 and aims to create up to 1000 new homes near stewartby the project will not affect millbrook power there will be hgv traffic during millbrooks twoyear construction phase but it would be routed to minimise effects on the local area construction transport plans for the bedford brickworks project have not yet been made available although it would be expected that any environmental assessment that accompanies their planning application would consider millbrooks requirements q12there are a number of new rail proposals in the local area including the proposed eastwest rail link and local line electrification works will the project affect these proposals two existing rail lines run either side of rookery pit the site of the millbrook power project neither of these lines or other local works will be affected by the project gas generation q1 why do we need new gasfired power stations a1 gasfired power generation is affordable reliable and flexible new gas power projects are acknowledged by the government as being essential to a lowercarbon economy as an alternative to coal and the construction and operation of rapidresponse open cycle gas turbine ocgt plants by drax group are part of a strategy to support an electricity system that has an increasing amount of less flexible low carbon and renewable energy technologies many ageing coal gas and nuclear power stations are closing down and new thermal power generation capacity is needed to help the country retain its energy security gas peaking plants such as millbrook power are designed specifically to provide essential backup power generation to intermittent renewable technologies such as wind turbines and solar farms new gas generation is part of a transition from more polluting fossil fuels of the past such as diesel oil and coal and to a low carbon economy driven by renewables storage demand side response and other low carbon technologies q2 why are you building gas power stations  using fossil fuels isnt going to help us meet our climate change obligations a2 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc said in its 2018 report that 85 of power will come from renewables by 2050 the other 15 will therefore need to come from flexible reliable technologies like gas the uk government has recognised the urgent need for new capacity for energy security and carbon reduction objectives and acknowledges reliance on fossil fuels must decrease but they will still be needed during the transition to a lower carbon economy q3 how often will the power station operate will you ever consider extending the operating hours in the future a2 we plan to use open cycle gas turbines ocgts to plug the gaps that intermittency creates  essentially flicking the switch on and off at very short notice  from cold to full power in just 30 minutes we anticipate they would run up to a maximum of 2250 hours in any given year provided that the fiveyear rolling average does not exceed 1500 hours this would only be at times when the electricity system is under stress the maximum operational limit for millbrook power plant will 2250 hours per year but modelling by drax group assumes much lower annual usage per annum through supporting more intermittent renewables millbrook power plant will also help to enable more coalfired power stations off the system q4 when will you start building the power station at rookery pit south and when will the power station be operational the project will take about two years to build it has a capacity market agreement to be operating by october 2024 q5 what about safety of the power project a4 gasfired power stations in this country have an excellent safety record and we do not consider there to be any issues of concern with our site and the neighbouring energy facilities drax power station millbrook power owners existing power plant has a betterthanaverage safety record among other coal gas and biomass power stations q6 why an open cycle rather than a combined cycle gas turbine ccgt a5 whilst an ocgts are less efficient than ccgts there are a number of reasons as to why they remain the preferred technology choice for peaking plant flexibility  ocgts have startup and shutdown times of less than 30 minutes where other power generation technologies take much longer become fully operational at maximum capacity from cold peaking plant such as ocgts are required to come online very quickly in response to sudden changes in demand or outages of other plant they are also suited to flexing their output up and down in a matter of seconds which helps national grid ensure the smooth running of the energy grid there is also no limit to the number of startstops a wellmaintained ocgt can achieve over its lifetime environmental impact  visualland take ocgt plants are more compact so reducing the land take required and they have shorter stacks because exhaust gasses are hotter these factors reduce the environmental impact of such plant environmental impact  water consumption ocgts do not consume material amounts of water in normal operation this is important in areas where water is scarce financial  losses in efficiency are far outweighed by the much cheaper build cost of ocgt when compared to ccgt and also because of the low number of hours they will be operational a maximum of 2250 hours out of the 8760 hours in any given year planning  consultation q1 who is the planning authority a1 as the project will generate more than 50 mw of energy and given its importance to the countrys energy security a development consent order dco application under the planning act 2008 was submitted to the national infrastructure team of the planning inspectorate in october 2017 the planning inspectorate considered the dco application and recommended that the secretary of state for business energy  industrial strategy approve the project he did so in march 2019 central bedfordshire and bedford borough councils have been key consultees in the planning and consultation process along with the parish councils in the vicinity and other local organisations q2 could the local authorities and local people participate in the examination process a2 yes organisations andor individuals were given the opportunity to register a representation and interest in the examination process between 9 december 2017 and 19 january 2018 giving notice of any interest in or objection to the application all representations were made public by the planning inspectorate on 23 january 2018 q3 were local people consulted before the submission of the application a3 yes public consultation has been an integral part of the planning process local people were consulted in 2014 and 2017 before the development consent order dco application was submitted their views have helped shape the main elements of the project q4 what about the environmental impact of the power station a4 an environment impact assessment eia was undertaken in 2014 to assess the likely significant environmental effects of the millbrook power project and further work on this was carried out during 2017 the eia process considered a range of issues including noise air emissions ecology visual impact heritagearchaeology and transport the environment agency the statutory body that regulates industrial emissions in england granted an environmental permit to millbrook power in january 2019 q5 there is a public appeal against the decision to approve covantas environmental permit  could local people appeal against yours too a6 the environment agency the statutory body that regulates industrial emissions in england granted an environmental permit to millbrook power in january 2019 their decision followed a period of public consultation during which no objections were received local economic benefit q1 how will the power station benefit the local area a1 the power station can bring a range of benefits to the area during both the construction and operational phases construction will take around two years and will provide job opportunities for approximately 150 skilled and semiskilled people in addition the facility will make a major contribution to local business rates and will be an active participant in the local community a detailed socioeconomic impact study has been submitted as part of the planning application via the environmental statement q2 how will the scheme benefit the area a2 the significance of longterm investment and the benefits of the construction phase for example opportunities for local subcontractors new power projects and power station conversions in the uk have been shown to have a significant socioeconomic footprint  we hope that our scheme will provide a catalyst for other investments within the area and as an investor and employer we would expect to play an active part in the region in line with draxs longstanding commitment to community engagement and being a responsible operator we will liaise with central bedfordshire council on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits to the surrounding area in 2017 drax group and its supply chain supported 2500 jobs in the east of england and
