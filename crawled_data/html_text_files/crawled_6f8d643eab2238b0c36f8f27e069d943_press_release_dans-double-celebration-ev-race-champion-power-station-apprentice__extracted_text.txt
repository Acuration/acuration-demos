power station dans double celebration ev race champion and power station apprentice a selby student is celebrating after his team took the chequered flag in an electric car street race sponsored by drax group  and being offered one of a dozen new apprenticeships at drax power station the uks biggest renewable power generator 29 april 2019 dan callon along with his selby college teammates built the electric car provided by drax group as part of its 35000 initiative to boost stem science technology engineering and maths skills at seven schools in the town the selby college team which gave up precious time during the easter holidays to fine tune their car and test it left other competitors from across the country trailing in their dust to take pole position in the greenpower street race event in hull yesterday sunday it rounded off a period of positive news for dan who also recently found out that he would be one of the next intake of engineering apprentices at drax power station based near selby later this year after successfully applying for the training role the six other schools from the selby area provided with kit cars and the tools to build them by drax also competed in the races in the centre of hull watched by hundreds of locals who lined the speciallyconed off race track goblin cars from camblesforth left and barwic parade right on track in hull click to download car designs included a bear a cannon and a tribute to the humber while another recycled the packaging the car was delivered in to make its bodywork the pupils and students took part in a range of colourful events from drag races to a 60minute endurance event on a special street circuit in the centre of hull but top marks went to the selby college team which came home first in an hourlong race against 13 other teams  crossing the finish line six minutes ahead of their nearest rival to the delight of dan and teammates sam bygrave liam dunn and lauren askin the selby college team after the race dan callon is the driver in the car click to download dan 17 from selby said its been a great experience building the car with the rest of the team and then driving it was amazing i cant believe we won  it was the perfect ending ive learnt so much while weve been building the car and now i cant wait to move on to the next stage of my career with my apprenticeship at drax im really looking forward to it drax power ceo andy koss said we are thrilled one of our teams won in hull at the weekend our congratulations go to dan sam liam and lauren  they have done a marvellous job  and i look forward to hopefully seeing dan at the power station later this year the commitment from all of the schools has been exceptional  its really sparked the students imaginations which is what this project is all about finding fun and exciting projects like this to engage young people and encourage them to study stem subjects is the key to ensuring the next generation of potential employees has the skills that innovative businesses like ours need he added too many children in the north are falling behind their counterparts in other areas of the uk when it comes to education and skills leading to a serious skills shortage for employers we want to change that with initiatives like this one liz ridley deputy principal at selby college said we are absolutely delighted  winning the race is a fantastic reward for all of the hard work that the students and dedicated tutors have put into this project the best part about it is that it doesnt stop here  more of our students will benefit from this initiative because we can dismantle the car and get new students to rebuild it each year we are extremely grateful to drax for all of their support our whole aim as a college is to give students the experience and skills they need for their future careers and its brilliant that dan has this opportunity with drax we wish him all the best as we do all our students the cannon selby abbeys car named after their teacher mrs cannon click to download stacey cannon a teacher at selby abbey primary whose pupils named their car the cannon in her honour said im really proud of them all and the effort they have put in to this and im proud to see the car out there with my name on it i think they have grown so much throughout this project especially in relation to the stem subjects it will hopefully open their minds to the world of engineering ends media contacts mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email protected t 07969080272 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email

assembled older students from selby high school holy family catholic high school and selby college built the more powerful formula 24 car which can reach speeds of up to 30mph both cars took around 15 hours to build with the teams also designing their own bodywork the primary school teams took part in a series of drag and slalom races in their goblin cars the top drivers from each team then raced against each other in a final 1km circuit through the city centre students from the secondary schools and colleges raced the f24 cars around the same circuit in an endurance test the teams had to switch between three drivers and maintain their cars during the race and the winner was the team which completed the most laps in 90 minutes photo caption main photo dan callon and the selby college
