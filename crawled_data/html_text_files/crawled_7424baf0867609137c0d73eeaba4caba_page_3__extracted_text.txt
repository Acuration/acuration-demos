negative emissions what are negative emissions 21 august 2020 carbon capture what are negative emissions in order to meet the longterm climate goals laid out in the paris agreement there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide co 2  currently in the atmosphere and the co 2 that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise the process of greenhouse gas removal ggr or co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere is possible through negative emissions  where more co 2 is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere negative emissions can be achieved through a range of naturebased solutions or through manmade technologies designed to remove co 2 at scale what naturebased solutions exist to remove co 2 from the atmosphere one millenniaold way of achieving negative emissions is forests  trees absorb carbon when they grow either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen or storing it over their lifetime this makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere planting new forests and regenerating forests has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result however this can also go beyond forests on land vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store co 2  and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much carbon as forests on land  an approach to negative emissions called blue carbon did you know bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world  its thick forests absorb three times the amount of co 2 the small country emits what manmade technologies can deliver negative emissions many scientists and experts agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this approach uses biomass  sourced from sustainably managed forests  to generate electricity as the forests used to create biomass absorb co 2 while growing the co 2 released when it is used as fuel is already accounted for  making the whole process low carbon by then capturing and storing any co 2 emitted often in safe underground deposits the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative  as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added direct air carbon capture and storage daccs is an alternative technological solution in which co 2 is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used while this could hold huge potential the technology is currently in its infancy and requires substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice the process of removing co 2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions because more co 2 is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it how much negative emissions are needed according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  negative emissions technologies could be required to capture 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050 negative emissions fast facts humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere the crust of the earth to the biosphere where we live at 100 times the rate of the natural carbon cycle there is enough sustainable biomass available to the uk to support beccs to remove 51 megatonnes of co 2 every year by 2050 according to the committee on climate change more companies are beginning to invest in negative emissions technologies with apple conserving mangroves  stripe allocating 1

beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a largescale source  for example a power station or factory  and then permanently storing them carbon capture usage and storage ccus is where captured carbon dioxide co 2  may be used rather than stored in other industrial processes or even in the manufacture of consumer products  how is carbon captured carbon can be captured either precombustion  where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used or postcombustion  where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned precombustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide under heat pressure the separated co 2 is captured and transported to be stored or used postcombustion carbon capture uses the addition of other materials such as solvents to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned the isolated carbon is then transported normally via pipeline to be stored permanently  usually deep underground  or used for other purposes carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that co 2 is not released into the atmosphere what can the carbon be used for once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways for example material including carbon nanofibres and bioplastics can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles while several startups are developing methods of turning captured co 2 into animal feed captured carbon can even assist in the largescale production of hydrogen  which could be used as a carbonneutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation where can carbon be stored carbon can be stored in geological reserves  commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs saline aquifers or unmineable coal beds the process of storage is referred to as sequestration the underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through mineral storage  where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage according to the global ccs institute  over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the usa norway and brazil what are the benefits of carbon storage co 2 is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in our atmosphere and therefore contributes to global warming by capturing and storing carbon it is being taken out of the atmosphere which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change carbon capture fast facts ccus is an affordable way to lower co 2 emissions  fighting climate change would cost 70 more without carbon capture technologies the largest carbon capture facility in the world is the petra nova plant in texas which has captured a total of 5 million tonnes of co 2  since opening in 2016 drax power station is trialling europes biggest bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage project beccs which could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year by the mid 2030s delivering a huge amount of the negative emissions the uk needs to meet net zero go

questions  negative emissions what is decarbonisation carbon capture what is decarbonisation decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide co 2  output of a countrys economy this is usually done by decreasing the amount of co 2 emitted across the active industries within that economy why is decarbonisation important currently a wide range of sectors  industrial residential and transport  run largely on fossil fuels  which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal oil or gas the co 2 emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas trapping in heat and contributing to global warming by using alternative sources of energy industries can reduce the amount of co 2 emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change why target carbon dioxide there are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming however co 2 is the most prevalent as of 2018 carbon levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  the paris agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures dont rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial level with 195 current signatories  economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon with the uk leading the g20 nations in decarbonising its economy in the 21 st century how is decarbonisation carried out there are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power such as wind turbines solar panels and coalto biomass upgrades  meaning that homes and businesses dont have to rely on fossil fuels other innovations such as using batteries and allowing homes to generate and share their own power can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation as the electricity itself is made cleaner it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process other approaches such as reforestation or carbon capture and storage  help to pull existing carbon from the air to neutralise carbon output  or in some cases help to make electricity generation  and even entire nations  carbon negative alternative power options means that homes and businesses dont have to rely on traditional carbon fuels what is the future of decarbonisation for decarbonisation to be more widely adopted as a method for combating climate change there needs to be structural economical change  according to deloitte access economics creating more room for decarbonisation through investing in alternative energies means that there are a multitude of jobrich shovelready stimulus opportunities that also unlock longterm value decarbonisation fast facts a study by carbon brief in 2019 found that the uks carbon emissions have decreased by 38 since 1990 which is faster than any other major developed nation the uk has committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by enshrining this goal as law  and announcing a 3 billion investment in low carbon technologies in 2019 currently heavy industry cement steel and chemicals and heavyduty transport mainly shipping and aviation account

pioneering the use of carbon capture use and storage ccus  such as drax one of several ideas discussed to make the sport more sustainable has been capturing carbon that is then mixed with hydrogen from water to form liquid fuel such technology is in development and drax is researching how carbon dioxide co 2  can be used to produce fuels its innovation engineers recently met with velocys the fuels technology company which plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the humber could f1 go electric while greener fuels are the most obvious way forward there have been calls for alternative forms of energy to be used to power f1 cars a hydrogen solution could be developed quickly but it would significantly increase the bulkiness and weight of cars but what about electric formula one race car electric power is attractive but its currently still quite difficult to scale that up pat symonds chief technical officer at formula one said in an interview  with any of the technologies on the

has long shaped british trade its also been instrumental in how the country is powered historically providing an abundant source of oil and natural gas however this cold fringe off the north atlantic could also play a vital role in decarbonising the uks economy  not because of its full oil and gas reservoirs but thanks to its empty ones in an effort to limit or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co 2  in the atmosphere countries around the world are rushing towards large scale carbon capture usage and storage projects ccus in this process co 2 is captured from sources such as energy production and manufacturing or directly removed from the air and reused or stored permanently  for example underground in disused oil and gas reservoirs or other suitable geological formations source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload the international energy agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius yet the global ccs institute reports that as of 2019 the projects currently in operation or under construction had the capacity to capture and store only 40 million tonnes of co 2 per year its clear the global capacity for ccus must accelerate rapidly in the coming decade but it raises the questions where can these millions of tonnes of co 2 be stored and what happens to it once it is where can you store co 2  the most welldeveloped approach to storing co 2 is injecting it underground into naturally occurring porous rock formations such as former natural gas or oil reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers these are deep geological formations with deposits of very salty water present in the rocks pores and most commonly found under the ocean the north sea and the area off the us gulf coast contain several saline aquifers once co 2 has been captured using ccus technology  its pressurised and turned into a liquidlike form known as supercritical co 2  from there its transported via pipeline and injected into the rocks found in the formations deep below the earths surface this is a process called geological sequestration source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload but while pumping co 2 into the ground is one thing ensuring it stays there and isnt released into the atmosphere is another fortunately there are several ways to ensure co 2 is stored safely and securely keeping the lid on co 2 stored underground put simply the most straightforward way underground reservoirs store co 2 is through the solid impermeable rock that typically surrounds them once co 2 is injected into a reservoir it slowly moves upwards through the reservoir until it meets this layer of impermeable rock which acts like a lid the co 2 cannot pass through this is whats referred to as structural storage and is the same mechanism that has kept oil and gas locked underground for millions of years white chalk stone over time the co 2 trapped in reservoirs will often begin to chemically react with the minerals of the surrounding rock the elements bind to create solid chalky minerals essentially locking the co 2 into the rock in a process called mineral storage in the case of saline aquifers as well as structural and mineral storage the co 2 can dissolve into the salty water in a process called dissolution storage here the dissolved co 2 slowly descends to the bottom of the aquifer in any given reservoir each or all of these processes work to store co 2 indefinitely and while there remains some possibility of co 2 leakage from a site research suggests it will be minimal one study published in the journal nature suggests more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years storage for the net zero future in the united states industrial scale storage is in action in texas wyoming oklahoma and illinois and there are projects in progress across the united arab emirates australia algeria and canada however there is still a long way to go for ccus to reach the scale it needed to limit the effects of climate change research has shown that globally there is an abundance of co 2 storage sites which could support widespread ccus adoption a report compiled by researchers at imperial college london and e4tech and published by drax details an estimated 70 billion tonnes of storage capacity in the uk alone the us on the other hand has an estimated storage capacity of 10 trillion tonnes its clear the capacity for storage is present it now remains the task of governments and companies to ramp up ccus

emissions power station as part of the zero carbon humber partnership it could also form a part of the worlds first zero carbon industrial hub in the north of the uk such projects are indicative of the big ambitions ccus technology could realise  not just decarbonising single sites but capturing and storing co 2 from entire industries and regions there is still a way to go to meet that ambition

reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate

carbon capture use and storage ccus is a vital technology in the energy industry with facilities already in place all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide co 2  emissions however for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2 o c  as per the paris climate agreement  emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy from cement factories to farmland ccus technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world construction the global population is increasingly urban and by 2050 its estimated 68 of all people will live in cities  for cities to grow sustainably its crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced construction currently accounts for 11 of all global carbon emissions  this includes emissions from the actual construction work such as from vehicle exhaust pipes but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials steel and concrete are emissionsheavy to make they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions deploying widespread ccus in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment steel manufacturing alone regardless of the electricity used to power production is responsible for about 7 of global emissions  projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in europe and are already in motion in the united arab emirates abu dhabi national oil company and masdar a renewable energy and sustainability company formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercialscale ccus projects in its project with emirates steel which began in 2016 about 800000 tonnes of co 2 is captured a year from the steel manufacturing plant this is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery eor the commercially selfsustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrialscale projects in the region cement manufacturing a process that produces as much as 8 of global greenhouse gases  is also experiencing the growth of innovative ccus projects norcem cement plant in brevik norway has already begun experimenting with ccus calculating that it could capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year and store it under the north sea if the project wins government approval norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023 however as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it a team at massachusetts institute of technology is exploring a new method of cement production that is more ccus friendly  by pretreating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process the co 2 produced is released in a pure concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products such as fizzy drinks agriculture its hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry as well as feeding the world it employs a third of it  within this sector fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply however the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2 of global co 2 emissions ccus technology can reduce the co 2 contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser while maintaining crop reliability in 2019 oil and gas climate initiatives ogci climate investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest ccus project in the us based at the wabash valley resources fertiliser plant in indiana  the project will capture between 13 and 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the ammonia producer per year the captured carbon will then be stored 2000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer similarly since the turn of the millennium mitsubishi heavy industries engineering has deployed ccus technology at fertiliser plants around asia  co 2 is captured from natural gas precombustion and used to create the urea fertiliser however the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more naturebased and cheaper ways soil acts as a carbon sink capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it however intensive ploughing can damage the soils ability to retain co 2  it only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques like minimising soil disturbance or crop and grazing rotations to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of co 2 and even make farms carbon negative  transport the transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions according to the world health organisation electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sectors decarbonisation however at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads there are other essential modes of transport where ccus has a role to play climeworks a swiss company developing units that capture co 2 directly from the air has begun working with rotterdam the hague airport to develop a direct air capture dac unit on the airports grounds climeworks plant technology source climeworks photo by julia dunlop hydrogen filling station in hamburg germany however beyond just capturing co 2 from planes taking off climeworks aims to use the co 2 to produce a synthetic jet fuel  creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere a pilot project aims to create 1000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021 another approach to zerocarbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen which is already powering cars trains buses and even spacecraft  hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways but its predominantly created from natural gas through a process in which co 2 is a byproduct ccus can play an important role here in capturing the co 2 and storing it  preventing it entering the atmosphere the hydrogenpowered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat from every industry to every business to everyone as ccus technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites to entire economic regions global thermostat is developing dac technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes the system uses the waste heat to power a dac unit either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere such technologies along with those already in action like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  can quickly make negative emissions a reality at scale  however to capture transport and permanently store co 2 at the scale needed to reach net zero collaboration partnerships and shared infrastructure between businesses in industrial regions is essential the uks humber region is an example of an industrial cluster where a large number of highcarbon industrial sites sit in close proximity to one another by installing beccs and ccus infrastructure that can be utilised by multiple industries the uk can have a far greater impact on emissions levels than through individual smallscale ccus projects decarbonising the uk and the world will not be achieved by individual sites and industries but by collective action that transcends sectors regions and supply chains

carbon dioxide co 2  from power station refinery and factory exhausts has long been hailed as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the uk and the rest of the world to net zero  after a number of false starts and policy hurdles the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever carbon capture use and storage ccus is finally coming of age increasing innovation and investment in the space is enabling the development of ccus schemes at scale today there are over 19 largescale ccus facilities in operation worldwide while a further 32 in development as confidence in government policies and investment frameworks improves once co 2 is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers in a process known as sequestration it has also long been used in enhanced oil recovery eor a process where captured co 2 is injected into oil reservoirs to increase oil production  drax power station is already trialling

for ageold rivals glasgow and edinburgh the race to the top has taken a sharp turn downwards instead theyre in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first net zero carbon city in the uk while they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more
