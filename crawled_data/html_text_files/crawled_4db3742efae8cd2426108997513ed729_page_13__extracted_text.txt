website wwwdraxcom tags investors  financial reports balancing for the renewable future 6 july 2018 power generation its not news to say great britains electricity system is changing low carbon electricity sources are on course to go from 22 of national generation in 2010 to 58 by 2020 as installation of wind and solar systems continue to grow but while there has been much change in the sources fuelling electricity generation the system itself is still adapting to this transformation when the national grid was first established in the 1920s it was designed with coal and big spinning turbines in mind it meant that just about every megawatt coming onto the system was generated by thermal power plants as a result the mechanisms keeping the entire system stable  from the way frequency and voltage is managed to how to start up the country after a mass black out  relied on the same technology these ancillary services  those that stabilise the system  are crucial to maintaining a balanced electricity system ancillary services are needed to make sure demand is met by generation and that generation gets from one place to the next with no interruptions explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax because whats important is that all demand must be met instantaneously in todays power system however weather dependent technology like offshore wind and home solar panels are increasingly making up the countrys electricity generation their intermittency or variability is in turn impacting both the stability of the grid and how ancillary services are provided running a large power system with as much as 85 intermittent generation  for example on a very windy clear sunny day  is thought to be achievable it isnt a scenario anticipated for the large island of great britain but to deal with the fastpace of change on its power system which recently managed to briefly achieve 47 wind in its fuel mix  there is a need to develop new techniques technologies and ways of working to change how the countrys grid is balanced new storage tech takes on balancing services one of the technologies thats expected to provide an increasing amount of balancing services is gridscale batteries  one stabilisation function offered by batteries and other electricity storage options is to provide reserve at times when demand peaks or troughs this matches electricity demand and generation combined with their ability to respond quickly to changes in frequency batteries can be a significant source of frequency response batteries can also absorb and generate reactive power  which can then be deployed to push voltage up or down when it starts to creep too far from the 400kv or 275kv target depending on the powerlines the electricity is travelling along needed to safely move electricity around the grid the challenge with batteries is that the quantity of megawatt hours mwh required to compensate for intermittency is very large the difference between the peak and trough on any day may be more than 20 gw for several hours see for yourself at electric insights  the significant price reductions in battery storage apply to technologies with short duration or low volume mwhs these are the technologies which have been developed at scale recently but will probably struggle to make up in any large quantity any shortfalls in generation resulting from prolonged periods of low intermittent generation a challenge currently being addressed relates to maintenance of battery state of charge this is a consequence of battery storage having a cycle efficiency of less than 100 this means that losses from continuous charging and recharging will have to be replenished from the available generation to avoid batteries going empty and being unavailable for grid services ultralow carbon advances rather than relying on batteries to provide ancillary services to support intermittent generation technical advancements are allowing the wind and solar facilities  which are generating more and more of the countrys electricity  to do so themselves the traditional photovoltaic pv inverters found on solar arrays were initially designed to push out as much active or real power as possible however new smart pv inverters are capable of providing or absorbing reactive power when it is needed to help control voltage as well as continuing to provide active power the major advantage of smart inverters is the limited equipment update required to existing solar farms to allow them to offer reactive power control the challenge here is that pv is embedded in distribution systems and therefore reactive services they provide may not cure all the problems on the transmission system similarly existing wind installations have traditionally focused on getting the greatest amount of megawatts from the available resources but with fewer thermal power stations on the grid ways of balancing the system with wind turbines are also being developed inertia is the force that comes from heavy spinning generators and acts as a damper on the system to limit the rate of change of frequency fluctuations while wind turbines have massive rotating equipment they are not connected to the grid in a way that they automatically provide inertia however research is exploring whats known as inertial response emulation that may allow wind turbines to offer faster frequency response this works through an algorithm that measures grid frequency and controls the power output of a wind turbine or whole farm to compensate for frequency deviations or quickly provide increases or decreases in power on the system inertial response emulation cannot be a complete substitute for inertia but can reduce the minimum required inertia on the system even in a future where the majority of the countrys electricity comes from renewable sources thermal generators may still be able to provide benefits to the system by running in synchronous compensation mode ie producing or consuming reactive power without real power however what is vitally important for the future of balancing services in great britain is a healthy transparent and investable market for generators demand side response and storage whether connected on the transmission or distribution networks a market for the future grid one of the primary needs of balancing service providers is greater transparency into how national grid procures and pays for services currently national grid does not pay for inertia with it becoming more important to grid stability incentive is needed to encourage generators with the capability to provide it those technologies that cant provide inertia could be encouraged to research and develop ways they could do so in the future standardising the services needed will help ensure providers deliver balancing products to the same level needed to support the grid it would also benefit from fixed requirements and timings for such services bundling related products such as reserve and frequency control and active power and voltage management will also offer operational and cost efficiencies to the providers driving investment in balancing services for the future ultimately requires the availability of longerterm contracts to offer financial certainty for the providers and their investors bridge to the future click to view larger graphic for the challenges of decarbonisation to be met in a socially responsible way great britains power system must be operated at as low a cost as possible to consumers with new technologies almost anything could be possible but operating them has to be affordable in many cases it may take time for costs of long duration batteries to come down  as it has with the most recent offshore wind projects to take contracts for difference cfds and draxs unit 4 coaltobiomass conversion under the renewables obligation  ro scheme  thermal power technologies such as gas that has proven capabilities in ancillary services markets can at least be used in a transitional period over the coming decades until a low carbon solution is developed biomass will continue to be an

for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve a flexible stable and cleaner power system for everyone tags electricity system balancing and ancillary services  decarbonisation  investors  energy prices  energy policy  national grid keeping the electricity systems voltage stable 15 may 2018 power generation in daytoday life the electricity system normally plays a consistent unfluctuating role powering the same things in the same way however behind the scenes electricity generation is a constant balancing act to keep the grid stable power stations themselves are like living animals  in need of continuous adjustment transmission networks need continual maintenance and keeping the whole grid at a frequency of 50 hz takes careful monitoring and finetuning one of the other constant challenges for great britains electricity system is keeping voltage under control keeping the volts in check voltage is a way of expressing the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field in more simplistic terms it acts as the pressure that pushes charged electrons known as the current through an electric circuit great britains national grid system runs at a voltage of 400 kilovolts kv and 275kv scotland also uses 132kv it is then reduced in a series of steps by transformers to levels suitable for supply to customers for example 11kv for heavy industrial or 230 volts v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  keeping the voltage steady requires careful management a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to increased wear and tear of equipment  and additional maintenance costs or even largescale blackouts power stations such as drax can control the voltage level through whats known as reactive power  if voltage is high absorbing reactive power back into the generator reduces it says drax lead engineer gary preece by contrast generating reactive power increases the voltage reactive power is made in an electricity generator alongside active power the electricity that powers our lights and devices and national grid can request generators such as drax to either absorb or produce more of it as its needed to control voltage so how is a generator spinning at 3000 rpm switched from producing to absorbing reactive power all it takes is the turn of a tap absorbing reactive power taps along a transformer allow a certain portion of the winding  which make up a transformers active part with the core  to be selected or unselected this allows the transformer to alter whats known as the phase angle which refers to the relationship between apparent power made up of reactive power and active power and active power this change in the phase angle regulates the power factor power factor is measured between 0 and 1 between 1 and 0 lagging means a generator is producing reactive power and increasing overall voltage whereas between 1 and 0 leading means it is absorbing reactive power and reducing voltage that absorbed reactive power doesnt just disappear rather it transfers to heat at the back end of the power stations generator temperatures can be in excess of 60 degree celsius says preece theres also a lot of vibration caused by the changes in flux at the end of the generator this can cause long term damage to the winding as the generators continue to produce active power while absorbing reactive power the conditions begin to reduce efficiency and if prolonged begin to damage the machines draxs advantage here is that it operates six turbines all of which are capable of switching between delivering or absorbing reactive power or vice versa in under two minutes voltage management in a changing grid the changing nature of great britains energy supply means voltage management is trickier than ever voltage creeps up when power lines are lightly loaded the increase of decentralised generation  such as solar panels and smallscale onshore wind farms operating to directly supply specific localities or a number of customers embedded on regional electricity networks  means this is becoming more common around the grid this creates a greater demand for the kind of reactive power absorption and voltage management that drax power station carries out gridscale batteries are being increasingly developed as a means of storing power from weather dependent renewable sources this power can then be pumped onto the grid when demand is high in a similar manner these storage systems can also absorb reactive power when theres too much on the system and discharge it when its needed  bringing the voltage down and up respectively the trouble is gridscale battery storage systems need to be absolutely huge and a 100 mw facility would be close to the size of football field and double stacked explains preece they are also not synchronised to the grid as a thermal turbine generator would be subsequently there is no contribution to inertia  as great britains power system continues to evolve maintaining its stability also needs to adapt where once the challenge lay in keeping voltage high and enough reactive power on the grid today its absorbing reactive power and keeping voltage down  it highlights the need for thermal generators that are designed to quickly switch between generating and absorbing to support the wider network this story is part of a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the areas of balancing services system

in decarbonising with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we are working on a fourth biomass unit conversion  through this flexible lowcarbon and customerfocused approach we aim to deliver higher quality earnings with a reduction in commodity exposure alongside opportunities for growth safety remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we have performed well in this regard although we continue to work to improve our performance across the group biomass is a challenging fuel to manage we work very hard to manage it carefully but unfortunately in december we had a fire at drax power station it cost us several weeks of production but most importantly no one was hurt we are currently incorporating the lessons learned from that incident in our operations to ensure that we operate as safely as we can our financial performance which we measure with reference to ebitda was 229 million in 2017 significantly ahead of 2016 140 million this increase was principally from producing high levels of renewable power from sustainable biomass and growth in our energy supply and pellet production businesses i am very pleased that all three of our businesses generated positive ebitda 1 last year for the first time in june we announced a new dividend policy this policy is to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows in determining the rate of growth in dividends the board will take account of contracted cash flows the less predictable cash flows from the groups commodity based business and future investment opportunities if there is a buildup of capital the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders for 2017 we are recommending a total basic dividend of 50 million 123 pence per share inclusive of a final dividend of 30 million equivalent to 74 pence per share we are also currently undertaking a 50 million share buyback programme this is consistent with our capital allocation policy and commitment to returns to shareholders sustainability remains at the heart of the business both the specific sustainability of biomass and more broadly the longterm sustainability of the group biomass sustainability is in the financial and longterm interests of the business and we always strive to ensure all our pellets comply with our policy it is fundamental to us that the biomass we use is sustainable and meets statutory requirements we have a dedicated sustainability team whose role is to ensure the wood pellets we manufacture and use to generate electricity meet the requirements we have set ourselves in our sustainability policy and the criteria for sustainable biomass as established by the uk government philip cox cbe chairman added the board and its committees play an active role in guiding the company and leading its strategy we greatly value the contribution made by our nonexecutive directors and during a time of transition their role is especially important the board has been complemented by the appointment of two new nonexecutives firstly david nussbaum  whose indepth knowledge of sustainability will support our continued focus in this area and secondly nicola hodson  whose experience in technology business transformation and energy will provide real value as the group delivers its strategy as a board we are well aware that to achieve our strategic objectives our commitment to diversity is crucial and reducing our gender pay gap is an important part of this we must do more to attract retain and progress women to ensure were an employer of choice for everyone who sees their future in energy in this context we are supportive of the goals of hampton alexander  it only remains for me to say that your board remains totally committed to the complementary aims of delivering sustainable longterm value for the group and of helping our country build a lowcarbon economy  enquires investor relations mark strafford 44 0 1757 612491 media ali lewis 44 0 1757 612165 website wwwdraxcom notes ebitda is defined as

19 april 2018 power generation from roman mines to the fuel behind the continentwide industrial revolution europe has a long history with coal  but with reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions now firmly on the global agenda europes love for coal is rapidly declining collectively the eu aims for renewable sources to account for 20 of gross final energy consumption by 2020 and 27 by 2030  countries in and outside the eu as well as businesses and organisations are setting ambitious targets to phase out coal as part of the uk and canadaled powering past coal alliance which drax

movement is not only being fuelled by an increased capacity in wind and solar generation but also by other lowcarbon energy sources enabling countries to kick their coal habits aiming for 100 renewable as myth after myth is dispelled about renewables  there are countries proving it is possible to power a modern developed nation entirely through renewable energy sources up in the northernmost reaches of europe iceland already generates all its electricity from renewable sources this is split between 75 hydropower and 25 geothermal power  geothermal not only offers a renewable source of electricity but also hot water for heating the volcanic island nation a geothermal power station steams on a cold day in iceland hydropower is also a key contributor to norways renewable ambitions with more than 31 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower capacity norway is able to rely on it as a source of electricity and export its plentiful oil and natural gas reserves to countries still dependent on fossil fuels many parts of europe are well suited to hydropower with reliable rainfall and the mountainous topography necessary to construct dams and power stations parts of austria romania and georgia also make substantial use of hydropower as a source of electricity artificial lake behind the bicaz dam at sunset romania for countries without this access to largescale hydropower its the increased installation of renewables that holds the key to eliminating the need for coal growing renewable generation last year saw electricity generation from renewable sources overtake that from coal for the first time thanks to continuous expansion of wind solar and biomass capacity around the continent between 2010 and 2017 generation from wind solar and biomass installations in eu countries more than doubled from 302 terawatt hours twh to 670 twh according to eurostat  driven primarily by an increase in wind capacity as a source of renewable electricity wind has already proved capable of generating major portions of a countrys demand managing to meet 44 of denmarks overall demand in 2017  this was after previously producing a 40 electricity surplus one day for the country  allowing it to export the emissionfree electricity to neighbours wind turbines on the east coast of sweden across the eu generation from wind more than doubled from 150 twh to 364 twh from 2010 to last year while solar generation grew five times from 23 twh to 119 twh and biomass jumped from 129 twh to 196 twh by contrast coal and lignite fell from 818 twh to 669 twh these renewable electricity sources along with hydropower now account for 30 of eu countries collective electricity generation and while coal generation continues to drop other low carbon energy sources particularly nuclear still play essential roles in many european energy systems from coal to low carbon sweden is one of the leaders in renewable electricity generation setting 2040 as the date to move to totally renewable energy however while it currently counts 65 gw of wind capacity installed and has already exceeded its 2020 renewable generation goals  the countrys 10 nuclear reactors still make up 40 of its electricity output  sweden aims to phasenuclear out of its energy mix but this will force it to import more power from neighbours to meet demand  france is even more dependent with nuclear making up 75 of its electricity production and earning more than 3 billion a year for the country in exports it aims to reduce its nuclear generation to 50 with president emmanuel macron claiming continued nuclear generation offers  the most carbonfree way to produce electricity with renewables  fessenheim nuclear and hydroelectric power plants in alsace france as a reliable and lowcarbon source of electricity the most modern nuclear power stations add a certain amount of flexibility to grids enabling greater adoption of intermittent renewable sources across the eu nuclear made up a quarter of electricity generation in 2017  gas in the transition much more flexible than nuclear gas plays an essential role in many countries it accounted for 19 of electricity generation in the eu last year and produces around half the co 2 and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal  gas turbines can begin generating electricity at full power in just 30 minutes from a cold start  or 10 minutes from warm standby allowing it to plug any gaps in demand left by intermittent renewables its ability to provide many system services such as reserve power and frequency response will see it play an important transition role over the coming decades until cleaner technologies are able to take over artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission coal is not gone yet making up 11 of eus electricity generation in 2017 but the momentum behind decarbonisation is keeping europe on track to meet its ambitious emissions target and take the final step away
