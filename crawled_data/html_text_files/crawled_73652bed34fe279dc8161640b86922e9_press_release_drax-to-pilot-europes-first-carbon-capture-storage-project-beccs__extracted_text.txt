negative putting britain at the forefront of the race to develop beccs 20 may 2018 drax has announced that it is to pilot the first bioenergy carbon capture storage beccs project of its kind in europe which if successful could make the renewable electricity produced at its north yorkshire power station carbon negative beccs is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced this means power generation would no longer contribute to climate change but would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere the demonstration project will see drax partner with leedsbased ccapture and invest 400000 in what could be the first of several pilot projects undertaken at drax to deliver a rapid lower cost demonstration of beccs drax power station became the largest decarbonisation project in europe by upgrading its existing facilities and if the pilot is successful it will examine options for a similar repurposing of existing infrastructure to deliver more carbon savings a report by the energy technology institute in 2016 has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year in the uk  approximately half the nations emissions target lr jason shipstone head of rd drax group caspar schoolderman director of engineering ccapture ltd andy koss ceo drax power prof christopher rayner technical director ccapture ltd carl clayton research and innovation engineer drax group download high res photo  the first phase of the project starting this month will look to see if the solvent ccapture has developed is compatible with the biomass flue gas at drax power station a labscale study into the feasibility of reutilising the flue gas desulphurisation fgd absorbers at the power station will also be carried out to assess potential capture rates fgd equipment is vital for reducing sulphur emissions from coal but has become redundant on three of the generating units at drax that have been upgraded to use biomass because the wood pellets used produce minimal levels of sulphur depending on the outcome of a feasibility study the ccapture team will proceed to the second phase of the pilot in the autumn when a demonstration unit will be installed to isolate the carbon dioxide produced by the biomass combustion will gardiner ceo drax group said if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must  and beccs is a leading technology to help achieve it this pilot is the uks first step but it wont be the only one at drax we will soon have four operational biomass units which provide us with a great opportunity to test different technologies that could allow drax the country and the world to deliver negative emissions and start to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere unlike previous ccs projects drax has been involved with this is an early pilot for a new technology it will examine the potential of a new form of carbon capture post combustion on biomass rather than coal the governments clean growth strategy identified beccs as one of several greenhouse gas removal technologies that could remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation claire perry energy  clean growth minister said we aim to make the uk a world leader in carbon capture usage and storage a key part of our modern industrial strategy its hugely exciting that drax has chosen to invest in this innovative project demonstrating how government support for innovation can create an environment where companies can develop new technologies and scale up investment to build the sectors we will need to achieve long term decarbonisation ccapture is a spinout from the department of chemistry at the university of leeds established through funding from ip group plc chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds said we have developed fundamentally new chemistry to capture co 2 and have shown that it should be suitable for capturing the carbon produced from bioenergy processes the key part is now to move it from our own facilities and into the real world at drax through the pilot scheme we aim to demonstrate that the technology weve developed is a costeffective way to achieve one of the holy grails of co 2 emissions strategies  negative emissions in power production which is where we believe the potential co 2 emissions reductions are likely to be the greatest andy duley director of commercialisation at the university of leeds said the university has an established track record in working with private sector investors and leveraging its own funds to launch successful spin out companies ccapture is the latest example of our continued success in converting research expertise into a valuable service which directly benefits industry and has the potential to make an impact around the world ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of news e email protected t 44 01757 612165 jessica gorton drax

of the electricity it produced in 2017 was renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co2 from the atmosphere than it releases the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds university and has attracted support from ip group the department for business energy and industrial strategys energy entrepreneurs fund and the co2 capture project for co2 capture technology which has potential in a range of areas including biogas upgrading natural gas sweetening and hydrogen production about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in

chemistry and engineering to develop solvent systems for the removal of co 2 from gas streams with the potential to capture the co 2 in a form suitable for storage and prevent it from entering the earths atmosphere ccaptures proprietary technology aims to remove or scrub co 2 from large scale point sources of gas emissions this is important for a broad range of commercially and environmentally relevant areas the low cost high energy efficiency of ccaptures solvents help minimise the cost of ccs implementation and makes electricity generation with ccs a much more affordable environmentally
