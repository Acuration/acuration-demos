the sustainable biomass programs redii renewable energy directive 20182001eu normative framework to the scope of its british columbia certification program part of this process requires the development  consultation of the sbp redii supply base evaluation  associated mitigation measures that are required on top of sbp certification to allow for the sale of redii sbp compliant wood pellets here you will find a copy of the risk assessment  detailed summary of how drax intend on carrying out mitigation measures for specified risk identified that relates to its british columbia operations and we want your input as an active member of the forestry community in bc your input is valuable to us when designing mitigation measures and we want to ensure we capture as many perspectives as possible for context drax are not forest managers we source wood fibre waste like sawdust shavings chips and bark from sawmills and other wood processing facilities we also source wood fibre waste direct from the forest from sources like slash or roadside debris piles wildfire damaged or insect damaged stands wildfire proofing or habitat enhancement projects and occasionally receive pulp quality roundwood where pulp markets do not exist our ability to influence on the ground forest activities is limited due to our dissociation from forest management activities our mitigation measures are focused on information gathering and sharing in the form of detailed supplier mapping packages in addition to monitoring policies participation in conservation efforts and advocating for forest certification we want to hear your thoughts and comments as to the supply base evaluation  the effectiveness of mitigation measures and if there are any other factors we should consider the comment period will be open until may 30 th  2023  however if you have comments after that date feel free to pass them along anyway they may not make it into the final draft for this year but we will
