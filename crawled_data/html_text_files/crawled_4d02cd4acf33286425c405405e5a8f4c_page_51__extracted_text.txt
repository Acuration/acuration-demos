roasted turkeys were powered by the cleanest electricity mix ever on christmas day 2017  rounding off a record breaking year for power generation in britain according to analysis of electric insights data by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax 2017 is on course to be the cleanest year for electricity generation carbon emissions from power generation were just 142gkwh on christmas day  more than 10 lower than on december 25 2016  gas generators provided over 30 of the required capacity and coal provided just 14 on christmas day  compared to 179 for gas and 71 for coal in 2016 roasted turkeys were powered by the greenest electricity mix ever in 2017 dr iain staffell of imperial college london said this was achieved in spite of generation from renewables being lower than on christmas day last year mainly due to the continued reduction in coal over this year being swapped for gas power stations the low carbon christmas comes after a whole host of renewables records were broken throughout the year and with much less coal on the system helping to reduce britains carbon emissions by around half of what they were five years ago dr staffell explained the carbon intensity of britains electricity halved between 2012 and 2016 and we think that by new year the 2017 figure will be at least another 10 lower than last years record this means the average british household produced 100 kg less co 2 this year than they did last year without having to lift a finger all the changes are being made behind the scenes electric insights data also shows that january 17 2017 was the dirtiest day of the year with carbon intensity reaching 398g co 2 kwh despite this britains carbon emissions have fallen sharply as renewables records were broken throughout the year dr staffell said several real milestones were reached by renewable electricity throughout 2017  we set a new record in march for renewable generation which was then broken again in june it helped that wind speeds were relatively high during the year so wind farm output was up by around one third compared to last year also electricity demand was a little lower meaning that renewable output formed a bigger part of the mix the records broken throughout the year include february was a record breaking month for biomass with 21gw produced from biomass generation a new record for wind solar hydro and biomass power was made in the first three months of 2017 with 232 of britains power coming from these technologies over the first quarter however this record was then broken again in the next three months with almost a quarter of the uks electricity between april and june being generated sustainably  wind solar hydro and biomass accounted for 249 of the uks energy mix no coal was used in power stations for the first time in more than 130 years on april 22 nd dr iain staffell of imperial college london added this was a huge milestone the first day in which no electricity came from coal since the first steamdriven power station opened in the 1880s on 26 th may a new solar record was made with 31gw of energy produced throughout the day from solar  almost triple the yearly average of 12gw per day dr staffell said a great deal of new solar has been installed on the system which meant that the previous record was smashed june was the cleanest month of the year with 188g per kwh of carbon emitted compared to 339g per kwh in january  the dirtiest month dr staffell said this is due to demand being lower so we could make do with very little coal generation and gas was much lower too 8 th december saw a new record for wind energy with 116gw of electricity from wind power produced over the day dr staffell explained as with solar electricity new capacity made it easy for the previous wind power record to be broken 2017 was also a very windy year compared to 2016 interconnectors also had a recordbreaking year with the link to france reaching new highs for both imports and exports 26 th march saw 1994mw imported into britain from france while conversely 16 th november saw 2020mw exported from britain to france andy koss drax power ceo said britains energy system is rapidly changing as the carbon price floor continues to force coal off the system and gas and renewables play an increasingly important role in helping to reduce carbon emissions  all year round at drax we have upgraded half of the power station to run on flexible reliable sustainable biomass around 70 of the power we produce is now renewable  enough for four million households we are also looking at repowering two of our remaining coal generating units with gas to provide up to 36gw of power and developing up to 200mw of battery storage with the four rapid response gas power stations we are developing which will help to support the system and enable more renewables onto the grid here at drax we are playing an important part in helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media relations e email protected t 01757 612165 editors notes data from electric insights comparing demand

group ceo said cleaner economic growth is one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time  with the uks clean economy predicted to grow at four times the rate of gdp reducing carbon in electricity generation is the fastest way to reduce emissions and ensure our economy is clean and strong electric cars ai and automation all depend on a flexible secure electricity system which sustainable biomass and rapid response gas power stations can support at drax we are already helping growing businesses be more sustainable  the proportion of businesses choosing to use renewable electricity supplied by haven power part of drax group has more than tripled this year reducing their carbon emissions by 76 compared to five years ago and saving the uk almost 15 million tonnes of carbon drax power ceo andy koss comments on industrial strategy white paper uncategorized andy koss drax power ceo said the industrial strategy highlights that there is a technological revolution underway which will be powered by electricity the northern powerhouse region is well placed to lead the clean energy revolution because it has the expertise knowledge skills and infrastructure to deliver clean growth based on decades of powering the rest of the country creating bespoke regional industrial strategies which can draw on skills and strengths available in areas like the north will help us to maximise the opportunities and deliver real growth the northern powerhouse region has been leading the way in new technologies such as bioenergy offshore wind and nuclear power and drax alone generated 577 million for the northern powerhouse regional economy supporting more than 6000 jobs in the region in 2016 drax group ceo dorothy thompson responds to chancellor philip hammonds budget 22 november 2017 uncategorized dorothy thompson drax group ceo said having this clarity from the chancellor on the carbon price floor will help to unlock further investment in lowcarbon and renewable technologies ensuring that together we can continue creating a cleaner economy for future generations reducing carbon in our energy system is the fastest way to deliver a lowcarbon economy the carbon price floor has enabled the uk to half the amount of carbon emitted through electricity generation since 2012 the support for electric vehicles in the budget demonstrates how vital low carbon electricity generation is for growth in other sectors of the economy at drax we will now continue to explore new ways of converting our remaining coal generating units to biomass and gas and build new rapid response gas plants these moves will help take coal off the system quickly and cost effectively while maintaining security of supply and increasing our ability to provide flexible services to the grid britain enters top ten low carbon power league 15 november 2017 uncategorized britains electricity is now the 7 th cleanest climbing 13 places in the global rankings carbon price floor has driven unparalleled co 2 reductions britains emissions from electricity almost halved 47 between 201216 based on the findings drax calls on chancellor to maintain carbon price in budget britains electricity is now amongst the cleanest in the world  having moved 13 places up the global rankings to be placed 7 th in terms of the carbon content of its electricity among large and industrialised countries according to the latest electric insights report produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax britains shift was the biggest for any country in the league table the most any other country moved was eight places and this was by the netherlands in the opposite direction  down the leaders table the analysis shows that the uks carbon price has helped deliver unparalleled carbon reductions  its charge on greenhouse gas emissions has driven uptake in renewables and a shift away from coal to gasfired power generation dr iain staffell from imperial college london explained since we started electric insights a year ago we have seen a number of firsts across the power sector and this quarter is no different  britain has entered the worlds top ten low carbon power league for the first time britain is reducing its carbon emissions from electricity faster than any other major country and this has happened because the carbon price and lower gas prices have forced coal off the system  the amount of coalfired power generation in britain has fallen 80 between 2012 and 2016 in the netherlands coalfired electricity output has risen 40 over the same period as generators only have to pay the much lower european carbon price the carbon price floor is set by the uk government power generators in the uk are charged 23 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  produced compared to 5 per tonne in europe the six countries with lower carbon electricity than britain benefit from substantial hydropower resources or in the case of france a heavy reliance on nuclear andy koss drax power ceo said the analysis by dr staffell and the team at imperial college london shows quite clearly the impact britains carbon price has had in terms of helping to ensure we produce cleaner power for the uks homes and businesses its therefore vital that we maintain a meaningful carbon price when the chancellor announces the autumn budget if we are to meet our commitments on climate change without it we could see a reversal of the impressive results achieved so far  look at whats happened elsewhere britains carbon emissions from electricity almost halved 47 between 201216 and the carbon impact of britains electricity has fallen more than twice as fast as any other major economy new coal power stations were built in the netherlands between 2013 and 2016 leading to a dramatic increase in their coal consumption and carbon emissions drax has upgraded half of its power station in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass transforming it to become the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe the report has been shared with hm treasury as further evidence to support carbon pricing ahead of the autumn budget on 22 november 2017 country comparisons norway sweden and france have the cleanest power systems among large and industrialised countries due to their mountainous terrain
