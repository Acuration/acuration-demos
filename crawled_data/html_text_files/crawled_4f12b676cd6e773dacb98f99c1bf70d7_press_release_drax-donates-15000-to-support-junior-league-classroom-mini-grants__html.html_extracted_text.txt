Drax donates $15,000 to support Junior League Classroom Mini-grants
Renewable energy company Drax has donated $15,000 to support the Junior League of Monroe’s Classroom Mini-Grants program.
20 September 2022
The program offers educators in Ouachita Parish an opportunity to receive up to $500 in funding for unique and developmental school programs.
The Junior League of Monroe encourages educators of all levels from Pre-K to grade 12 education to apply for the Classroom Mini-Grants, which will be awarded in the fall of 2022 to ensure that the implementation of the programs can take place in the current school year.

Haley Holley, the Junior League of Monroe Vice President of Communications, said:
“With Drax’s full sponsorship of the Classroom Mini-Grants, we will be able to provide more students with engaging and beneficial programs that take place right in their classrooms.
“The mini-grant funded projects help current students learn to their fullest potential. Classroom Mini-Grant projects prioritize creative learning opportunities which provides an outlet for individual expression and development of critical thinking skills. Students will also build close relationships with other students, their families, and their communities by being involved with these Classroom Mini-Grants.”
According to the Columbus Academy, studies have linked creativity to higher academic achievement, higher-order thinking, problem-solving ability and better memory retention.
Matt White, Executive Vice President of Drax’s Pellet Operations, said:
“The Junior League of Monroe’s Classroom Mini-Grants is a great program that will benefit our communities by offering an interactive and creative classroom where students can learn new things in new ways. I hope the support from Drax will help educators inspire students, helping to foster an eagerness for learning and to play a part within their communities. I can’t wait to see the positive impact this program will provide.”
The Junior League of Monroe is an organization of women committed to promoting voluntarism, developing the potential of women, and improving communities through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers. Its purpose is exclusively educational and charitable.
Applications for the Classroom Mini-Grants are due October 10, 2022, and the recipients will be notified by October 24, 2022.
Drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations and is this year drawing up plans for a more targeted community spend.
In 2021, Drax supported education and skills in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama and provided donations to help communities hit by natural disasters and Covid and work to support sustainable forestry.
In Louisiana, support included
Hurricane Ida relief efforts
, sponsoring an
environmental education workshop
for teachers and launching a
Classroom of the Month program

Editor’s Notes
Through its operations in Louisiana and Mississippi, Drax supports more than 1,200 jobs and contributes $175m to the region’s economy.
This includes more than 1,200 jobs in Louisiana and Mississippi with 300 direct jobs across these two states in Drax’s three pellet mills and at the port of Greater Baton Rouge.
Drax’s pellet mills also support the wider supply chain of loggers, truckers, railway workers, port workers and other logistics professionals.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
Drax’s around 3,000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties. For more information visit
www.drax.com
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in England and Scotland. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is also where Drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology BECCS within its CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) Incubation Area.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.
The Group also aims to build on its BECCS innovation at Drax Power Station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative CO2 emissions each year from new-build BECCS outside of the UK by 2030 and is currently developing models for North American and European markets.
Pellet production and supply:
The Group has 18 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year.
Drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030, which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity. The pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in Europe and Asia for the generation of renewable power.
Drax’s pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in North Yorkshire, England to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses, and also to customers in Europe and Asia.
Customers:
Drax supplies renewable electricity to UK businesses, offering a range of energy-related services including energy optimisation, as well as electric vehicle strategy and management.
