helped to provide supplies of food toiletries warm clothing and stocking fillers to seafarers at immingham port over the festive period 9 december 2022 drax has worked with its partners associated british ports dan shipping and davis wagon services to jointly donate 3500 to the mission to seafarers a charity which supports people working at sea drax volunteers emma smith colin bansor and taslima ayre on board one of the ships volunteers from the charity as well as from drax and dan shipping packed bags with the donated items and supplies and then distributed to crews on the ships at immingham port including those carrying fuel for draxs supply chain mark gibbens drax head of logistics said we are proud to support the important work that the mission to seafarers does to bring support and comfort to the key workers in our supply chain and others during christmas id also like to thank our partners at abp dan shipping and davis wagon services for their contributions this is a way to thank the people employed throughout our supply chain whose invaluable work helps us to maintain reliable renewable electricity supplies for millions of homes and businesses i hope these donations will help the men and women working out at sea enjoy a more festive christmas even whilst away from loved ones revd tim linkens mission to seafarers chaplain said as we approach christmas seafarers are still out on their ships keeping global trade moving when you see the news reports of the supply chain challenges that may cause issues getting the presents you want you will rarely be told about the seafarers themselves the mission to seafarers supports those who are away from home missing their families and loved ones and its thanks to donations and volunteering efforts such as these that we are able to continue this vital work steve pullen managing director at dan shipping said when drax approached us with this volunteering opportunity we were more than happy to contribute and support what is a truly worthwhile initiative it was great to see the amount of donations and all the volunteers come together at the port to wrap the presents and then to meet some of the key workers i hope this gesture shows them how much we appreciate the important work they do drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations through various initiatives including fundraising for local charities and supporting education and skills  ends photo caption  volunteers from drax and dan shipping helped mission to seafarers pack the supplies to be distributed media
