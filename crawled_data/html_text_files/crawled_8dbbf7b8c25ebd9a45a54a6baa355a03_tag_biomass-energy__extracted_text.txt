biomass energy uk biomass strategy  highly supportive of biomass and a priority role for beccs 10 august 2023 investors the strategy outlines the potential extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon removals will gardiner drax ceo said will gardiner drax group ceo we welcome the uk governments clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that beccs can play in achieving the countrys climate goals the inclusion of beccs at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the uk wants to be a leader in carbon removals and drax is ready to deliver on this ambition we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in delivering beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire simultaneously providing reliable renewable power and carbon removals we look forward to working alongside the government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy through further progression of plans for beccs and ensuring an evidencedriven best practice approach to sustainability a priority role for beccs the strategy reiterates the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 with the potential for this to increase to 23mt by 2035 and up to 81mt by 2050 with beccs expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050 in the period to 2035 government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating whilst supporting projects transitioning to beccs beccs projects which includes drax power station are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and carbon capture and storage ccs technology ready to be deployed beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without beccs in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security the strategy notes the active work in government to support beccs including the development of business models biomass availability and sustainability the strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6 th carbon budget alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors a link to the strategy can be found here  scientific assessment of carbon removals from beccs alongside publication of the strategy the government has published an evidencebased assessment of beccs as a route to negative emissions the report sets out how well regulated beccs can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people the environment and the climate beccs at drax power station in march 2023 the government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of largescale powerbeccs projects by 2030 and that the drax power station beccs project had passed the deliverability assessment for the powerbeccs project submission process formal bilateral discussions with the government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 these discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of beccs at drax power station drax believes that beccs at drax power station is the only project in the uk that can enable the government to achieve this ambition in addition to the largescale renewable power and system support services it provides to the uk power system in july 2023 the government designated the viking ccs cluster as a track 2 cluster progressing a co 2 transport and storage network in the humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of highskilled jobs and energy security for decades to come along with the east coast cluster viking creates an additional potential pathway to support beccs at drax power station the government has also confirmed

beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  will gardiner the role of biomass in securing reliable power generation 5 december 2022 power generation  sustainable bioenergy key takeaways since 2021 there has been a sharp rise in the price of electricity driven by a steep increase in wholesale gas prices in europe in particular a number of factors including the impact of covid19 and the effects of the war in ukraine have contributed to driving gas prices to record highs the volatility of gas prices means the uk needs to find replacements for the role of gas in helping to balance the electricity grid biomass and pumped storage hydro have the capacity to provide reliable renewable energy to uk homes and businesses while contributing to keeping the grid stable great britain and many other parts of the world are in a phase of energy uncertainty since 2021 soaring power prices have caused energy bills to escalate as much as fivefold and led to a string of collapses of uk energy suppliers as of october 2022 the annual energy bill for a uk household with typical energy consumption has been capped at 2500 a year  96 higher than the winter 202122 price cap  the upper limits the rates suppliers can charge for their default tariffs the costs of energy to end consumers would be even higher were it not for this energy price guarantee introduced by the uk government on 1 october and currently due to be in place until 31 march 2023 in germany the government has committed 200 billion towards a defensive shield against surging energy prices while france has capped energy price increases at 4 for 2022 and 15 from january 2023  the primary factor in this change is the rise in natural gas prices periods of turbulence driven by commodity prices emphasises the need for a diverse secure supply of power generation available to the uk grid as the energy system works through the necessary transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources the need for a reliable lowcarbon affordable power becomes even greater whats driving up gas prices as the world went into lockdown in 2020 the demand for energy including gas dropped  and so did supply when countries began to emerge from lockdown in 2021 and economies started to reboot supply struggled to keep up with renewed demand triggering a rise in the price of wholesale gas and other fuels the cold winter in 20202021 and unusually hot summers in 2021 and 2022 also dented european gas storage levels further contributing to rising gas prices an already uncertain energy market was further destabilised by russias invasion of ukraine this was particularly true in europe most notably germany where russian gas at the time accounted for around 40 of total gas consumption  gas prices began increase rapidly as a result of factors including fears that russia would restrict the supply of gas to europe in response to sanctions against the country or that an embargo on russian gas would be introduced constrained gas supplies also increased global demand for alternative sources like liquified natural gas lng imports which account for about 22 of the uks gas this increase in demand has pushed up the price of these alternatives forcing countries to compete to attract supplies there are several reasons why higher gas prices have such a significant impact on uk energy prices firstly a considerable proportion of uk electricity comes from gas in the second quarter of 2022 gas represented 42 of the uk energy mix  making it the countrys single largest source of electricity the uk also relies heavily on gas to heat its homes and with those homes being some of the oldest and least energyefficient in europe it takes more gas to heat them up and keep them warm click to viewdownload the role of biomass and pumped storage hydro in ensuring security of supply in addition to the pressures placed on gas and electricity supplies since 2021 the uks journey to net zero depends on increasing reliance on intermittent sources of power such as wind and solar as such there is a renewed need to ensure a diverse range of power generation sources to secure electricity supply globally as gas becomes less economical biomass offers a renewable reliable dispatchable source of power that can balance the grid and supply baseload power regardless of weather conditions the turbine hall at cruachan power station our four 645 mw biomassfuelled generating turbines at drax power station make it the largest single renewable source of power in the uk the plant can produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of five million homes come rain or shine draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in the scottish highlands also offers national grid the capacity to store 440 mw of renewable power by absorbing excess electricity from zero carbon sources like wind and solar cruachan can store and deploy power when the grid needs it most the ability of pumped storage hydro and biomass plants to store energy and quickly adjust output as required will become ever more important as the uks use of renewables grows and there are fewer spinning turbines connected to the grid as renewable nonintermittent sources of electricity biomass and pumped storage hydro are central to a safe economic and stable electricity grid  and to the uks lowcarbon energy future tags biomass energy  electricity generation  flexibility and stability and power system security  electricity system balancing and ancillary services the key to sustainable forests thinking globally and managing locally 1 december 2022 sustainable bioenergy key takeaways working forests where wood products are harvested are explicitly managed to balance environmental and economic benefits while encouraging healthy growing forests that store carbon provide habitats for wildlife and space for recreation but there is no single management technique the most effective methods vary depending on local conditions by employing locally appropriate methods working forests have grown while supporting essential forestry industries and local economies forests in the us south british columbia and estonia all demonstrate how local management can deliver both environmental and economic wins forests are biological environmental and economic powerhouses collectively they are home to most of the planets terrestrial biodiversity they are responsible for absorbing 76 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  equivalent per year or roughly 15 times the amount of co 2 produced by the united states on an annual basis and working forests which are actively managed to generate revenue from wood products industries are important drivers for the global economy employing over 13 million people worldwide and generating 600 billion annually  but as important as forests are globally the key to maximizing working forests potential lies in smart active forest management while 420 million hectares of forest have been lost since 1990 through conversion to other land uses such as for agriculture many working forests are actually growing both larger and healthier due to sciencebased management practices the best practices in working forests balance economic social and environmental benefits but just as importantly they are tailored to local conditions and framed by appropriate regional regulations guidance and bestpractice the following describes how three different regions from which drax sources its biomass manage their forests for a sustainable future british columbia managing locally for global climate change british columbia is blanketed by almost 60 million hectares of forest  an area larger than france and germany combined over 90 of the forest land is owned by canadas government meaning the provinces forests are managed for the benefit of the canadian people and in collaboration with first nations from the provinces expanse of forested land less than half a percent 036 is harvested each year according to government figures  this ensures stable sustainable forests however theres a need to manage against natural factors click to viewdownload in 2017 2018 and 2020 catastrophic fires ripped through some of british columbias most iconic forest areas underscoring the threat climate change poses to the areas natural resources one response was to increase the removal of stands of trees in the forest harvesting the large number of dead or dying trees created by pests that have grown more common in a warming climate by removing dead trees diseased trees and even some healthy trees forest managers can reduce the amount of potential fuel in the forest making devastating wildfires less likely there are also commercial advantages to this strategy most of the trees removed are low quality and not suitable for processing into lumber these trees can however still be used commercially to produce biomass wood pellets that offer a renewable alternative to fossil fuels this means local communities dont just get safer forests they get safer forests that support the local economy the united states  thinning for healthier forests the us souths forests have expanded rapidly in recent decades largely due to growth in working forests on private land annual forest growth in the region more than doubled from 193 million cubic metres of wood in 1953 to 408 million cubic meters by 2015  this expansion has occurred thanks to active forest product markets which incentivise forest management investment in the southern us thinning is critical to managing healthy and productive pine forests thinning is an intermediate harvest aimed at reducing tree density to allocate more resources like nutrients sunlight and water to trees which will eventually become valuable sawtimber thinning not only increases future sawtimber yields but also improves the forests resilience to pest disease and wildfire as well as enhancing understory diversity and wildlife habitat click to viewdownload while trees removed during thinning are generally undersized or unsuitable for lumber theyre ideal for producing biomass wood pellets in this way the biomass market creates an incentive for managers to engage in practices that increase the health and vigour of forests on their land the results speak for themselves across us forestland the volume of annual net timber growth 36 higher than the volume of annual timber removals a managed working forest in the us south estonia seeding the future though estonia is not a large country approximately half of it is covered in trees meaning forestry is integral to the countrys way of life historically harvesting trees has been an important part of the national economy and the government has established strict laws to ensure sustainable management practices these regulations have helped estonia increase its overall forest cover from about 34 80 years ago to over 50 today  and as in the us south the volume of wood harvested from estonias forests each year is less than the volume added by tree growth sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia estonia has managed to increase its growing forest stock by letting the average age of its forests increase this is partially due to estonia having young fastgrowing forests in areas where tree growth is relatively new but it is also due to regulations that require harvesters to leave seed trees seed trees are healthy mature trees the seeds from which become the forests next generation by enforcing laws that ensure seed trees are not harvested estonia is encouraging natural regeneration of forests as in the us south protecting these seed trees from competition for water and nutrients means removing smaller trees in the area while these smaller trees may not all be suitable for lumber they are a suitable feedstock for biomass it means managing for natural regeneration can still have economic as well as environmental advantages different methods similar results laws landownership and forestry practices differ greatly between the us south british columbia and estonia but all three are excellent examples of how local forest management contributes to healthy rural economies and sustained forest coverage while there are many different strategies for creating a balance between economic and environmental interests all successful strategies have something in common they

british columbia millions of tonnes of waste wood  known in the industry as slash  is burned by the side of the road land managers are required by law to dispose of this waste wood  that includes leftover tree limbs and tops and wood that is rotten diseased and already fire damaged  to reduce the risks of wildfires and the spread of disease and pests the smoke from these fires is choking surrounding communities  sometimes smoking out entire valleys air quality meteorologist from bcs environment ministry trina orchard recently told infonewsca it also impacts the broader environment releasing some 3 million tonnes of co 2 a year into the atmosphere according to some early estimates slash pile in british columbia landfilling this waste material from logging operations isnt an option as it would emit methane  a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more potent than co 2  so you can see why it ends up being burned in its modernizing forest policy in bc the government has already identified its intention to phase out the burning of this waste wood left over after harvesting operations and is working with suppliers and other companies to encourage the use of this fibre this is a very positive move as this material must come out of the forests to reduce the fuel load that can help wildfires grow and spread to the point where they cant be controlled let alone be extinguished the wildfire risk is real and growing each year more forests and land are destroyed by wildfire impacting communities nature wildlife and the environment in the past two decades wildfires burned two and a half times more land in bc than in the previous 50year period according to very early estimates emissions from last years wildfires in the province released around 150 million tonnes of co 2  equivalent to around 30 million cars on the road for a year alan knight at the log yard for lavington pellet mill in british columbia during my recent trip to british columbia in canada first nations foresters academics scientists and government officials all talked about the burning piles of waste wood left over after logging operations rather than burning it it would be far better they say to use more of this potential resource as a feedstock for pellets that can be used to generate renewable energy while supporting local jobs across the forestry sector and helping bolster the resilience of canadas forests against wildfire i like this approach because it brings pragmatism and common sense to the debate over canadas forests from the very people who know the most about the landscape around them burning it at the roadside is a waste of a resource that could be put to much better use in generating renewable electricity displacing fossil fuels and it highlights the positive role the bioenergy industry can play in enhancing the forests and supporting communities drax is already using some of this waste wood  which i saw in the log yard for our lavington pellet mill in british columbia this waste wood comprises around 20 of our feedstock the remaining 80 comes from sawmill residues like sawdust chips and shavings waste wood for pellets at lavington pellet mill log yard its clear to me that using this waste material that has little other use or market value to make our pellets is an invaluable opportunity to deliver real benefits for communities jobs and the environment while supporting a sustainable circular economy in the forestry sector tags biomass energy  sustainability  wood pellets  forests  renewable energy  communities  forestry and forest management and arboriculture how biomass can enable a hydrogen economy 10 march 2022 carbon capture key points hydrogen as a fuel offers a carbonfree alternative for hardtoabate sectors such as heavy road transport domestic heating and industries like steel and cement there are several methods of producing hydrogen the most common being steam methane reforming which can be a carbonintensive process biomass gasification with ccs is a form of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs that can produce hydrogen and negative emissions  removing co 2 permanently from the atmosphere the development of both beccs and hydrogen technologies will determine how intrinsically connected the two are in a net zero future reaching net zero means more than just transitioning to renewable and low carbon electricity generation the whole uk economy must transform where its energy comes from to lowemissions sources this includes hardtoabate industries like steel cement and heavy goods vehicles hgvs as well as areas such as domestic heating one solution is hydrogen the ultralight element can be used as a fuel that when combusted in air produces only heat water vapour and nitrous oxide as hydrogen is a carbonfree fuel a socalled hydrogen economy has the potential to decarbonise hardtoabate sectors while hydrogen is a zerocarbon fuel its production methods can be carbonintensive for a hydrogen economy to operate within a net zero uk carbonneutral means of producing it are needed at scale and biomass energy from organic material  with or without carbon capture and storage in the case of beccs could have a key role to play in january 2022 the uk government launched a 5 million hydrogen beccs innovation programme  it aims to develop technologies that can both produce hydrogen for hardtodecarbonise sectors and remove co 2 from the atmosphere the initiative highlights the connected role that biomass and hydrogen can have in supporting a net zero uk producing hydrogen at scale hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe however it rarely exists on its own its more commonly found alongside oxygen in the familiar form of h 2 o because of its tendency to form tight bonds with other elements pure streams of hydrogen must be manufactured rather than extracted from a well like oil or natural gas as much as 70 million tonnes of hydrogen is produced each year around the world mainly to make ammonia fertiliser and chemicals such as methanol or to remove impurities during oil refining of that hydrogen 96 is made from fossil fuels primarily natural gas through a process called steam methane reforming of which hydrogen and co 2 are products without the use of carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus technologies the co 2 is released into the atmosphere where it acts as a greenhouse gas and contributes to climate change another method of producing hydrogen is electrolysis this process uses an electric current to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen molecules like charging an electric vehicle this method is only low carbon if the electricity sources powering it are as well for electrolysis to support hydrogen production at scale depends on a net zero electricity grid built around renewable electricity sources such as wind solar hydro and biomass however bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs offers another means of producing carbonfree renewable hydrogen while also removing emissions from the atmosphere and storing it  permanently producing hydrogen and negative emissions with biomass biomass gasification is the process of subjecting biomass or any organic matter to high temperatures but with a limited amount of oxygen added that prevents complete combustion from occurring the process breaks the biomass down into a gaseous mixture known as syngas which can be used as an alternative to methanebased natural gas in heating and electricity generation or used to make fuels through a watergas shift reaction the syngas can be converted into pure streams of co 2 and hydrogen ordinarily the hydrogen could be utilised while the co 2 is released in a beccs process however the co 2 is captured and stored safely and permanently the result is negative emissions heres how it works beccs starts with biomass from sustainably managed forests  wood that is not suitable for uses like furniture or construction  or wood chips and residues from these industries  is often considered waste in some cases its simply burnt to dispose of it however this lowgrade wood can be used for energy generation as biomass when biomass is used in a process like gasification the co 2 that was absorbed by trees as they grew and subsequently stored in the wood is released however in a beccs process the co 2 is captured and transported to locations where it can be stored permanently  the overall process removes co 2 from the atmosphere while producing hydrogen negative emissions technologies like beccs are considered essential for the uk and the world to reach net zero and tackle climate change building a collaborative net zero economy how big a role hydrogen will play in the future is still uncertain the climate change committees ccc 2018 report  hydrogen in a low carbon economy  outlines four scenarios these range from hydrogen production in 2050 being able to provide less than 100 terawatt hours twh of energy a year to more than 700 twh similarly how important biomass is to the production of hydrogen varies across different scenarios the cccs report puts the amount of hydrogen produced in 2050 via beccs between 50 twh in some scenarios to almost 300 twh in others this range depends on factors such as the technology readiness level of biomass gasification if it can be proven  technical work drax is currently undertaking  and at scale then beccs can deliver on the highend forecast of hydrogen production the volumes will also depend on the uks commitment to beccs and sustainable biomass the cccs  biomass in a low carbon economy  report offers a uk beccs hub scenario in which the uk accesses a greater proportion of the global biomass resource than countries with less developed carbon capture and storage systems as part of a wider international effort to sequester and store co 2  the scenario assumes that the uk builds on its current status and continues to be a global leader in beccs supply chains infrastructure and geological storage capacity if this can be achieved biomass and beccs could be an intrinsic part of a hydrogen economy there are still developments being made in hydrogen and beccs which will determine how connected each is to the other and to a net zero uk this includes the feasibility of converting hgvs and other gas systems to hydrogen as well as the efficiency of carbon capture transport and storage systems the cost of producing hydrogen and carrying out beccs are also yet to be determined the right government policies and incentives that encourage investment and protect jobs are needed to progress the dual development of beccs and hydrogen success in both fields can unlock a collaborative net zero economy that delivers a carbonfree fuel source in hydrogen and negative emissions through beccs tags innovation  hydrogen  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  technology  biomass energy alabama cluster catchment area analysis 16 february 2022 sustainable bioenergy the area of timberland in the alabama cluster catchment area has remained stable over the last 20 years increasing slightly from 408 million ha to 416 million ha an increase of 79 thousand hectares this area represents 796 of the total land area in 2020 up from 781 in 2020 the total area of forestland and woodland was 86 of the catchment area in 2020 with farmland making up 13 and urban areas 1 this land base can be considered to be heavily forested and dominated by timberland figure 1 land use type  alabama cluster the timberland area is classified by growth rate potential capable of achieving a minimum of 057 m 3 hayear more than 95 of the timberland area is in private ownership this proportion has remained stable since 2000 as shown in figure 2 figure 2 timberland ownership profile  alabama cluster the total standing volume the amount of carbon stored in the forest area has increased by 115 million m 3 since 2000 an increase of 30 most of this increase has occurred since 2010 with 90 million m 3 added to the inventory since this time reflecting the maturing age class of the forest resource as it passes through the peak growth phase almost all of this increase has been in the softwood pine forest area with a combined increase of 86 million m 3 since 2010 pine sawtimber and chipnsaw both increased by 46 since 2010 and pine pulpwood by 25 over the same period suggesting that the average tree size is getting larger as the forest matures figure 3 standing volume by product class  alabama cluster one measure of the sustainability of harvesting levels is to compare average annual growth against removals this comparison gives a growth drain ratio gdr where removals are equal to or lower than growth a gdr of 1 or more this is a measure of sustainability where the ratio falls below 1 this can indicate that harvesting levels are not sustainable in the longterm figure 4 shows that all pine product classes have a positive gdr since 2010 in particular the pine pulpwood gdr ratio is in excess of 2 suggesting that there is a substantial surplus of this product category by contrast the hardwood gdr for both sawtimber and pulpwood are both lower than 1 suggesting that harvesting levels for hardwood species should be reduced until growth can recover figure 4 growth drain ratio by product class  alabama cluster figure 5 shows the maturing age class of the forest area charting the change in annual surplus and deficit in each product class the trend shows that harvesting of pine sawtimber from 2000 to 2008 represented a deficit of growth compared to harvesting removals this indicates an immature forest resource with a low quantity of forest categorised as sawtimber therefore harvesting volume in mature stands outweighed the growth in midrotation stands as the forest aged and more standing timber grew into the sawtimber category the surplus of annual growth compared to removals increased sawtimber growth in 2020 was 3 million m 3 higher than in 2000 the surplus of pine pulpwood has remained positive and has increased substantially from 3 million m 3 in 2000 to 65 million m 3 in 2020 despite harvesting levels increasing slightly over this period figure 5 annual surplusdeficit of growth and removal by product class  alabama cluster biomass demand began in 2008 at a very small scale representing just 05 of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area from around 2013 it began to increase and reached peak in 2015 with a total demand of 724000 tons of pulpwood in that year representing 81 of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area after that time demand for pulpwood declined as pellet mills switched to mill residuals the latest data on pulpwood demand shows that the biomass sectors made up just 28 of total pulpwood demand in 2020 with just over 216000 tonnes of total demand this demonstrates that the biomass and wood pellet sector is a very small component of the market in this region and unlikely to influence forest management decision making as shown in figure 6 figure 6 pulpwood demand by market  alabama cluster pine pulpwood stumpage prices have declined significantly since a peak in 2013 falling from an annual high of 946 when demand was strongest to just 412 in 2020 as demand for pine pulpwood declined in 2020 pine sawtimber prices have seen a similar decline from a high point in the early 2000s to a plateau from 2011 onwards sawtimber stumpage more than halved in value over this period from 49 per ton to 22 per ton this can have a significant impact on forest management objectives and decision making figure 7 stumpage price change by product category  alabama cluster detailed below are the summary findings from hood consulting on the impact of biomass demand on key issues in the alabama cluster catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows that total timberland area has held steady and averaged roughly 4172000 hectares in the alabama cluster catchment area since alabama pelletsaliceville started up in late2012 more importantly planted pine timberland the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production has increased more than 75000 hectares 49 in the catchment area since alabama pellets startup in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however the evidence is inconclusive as to whether increased demand attributed to bioenergy has caused or is responsible for those changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that the prevalence of thinnings temporarily increased in the alabama cluster market from 20072013 due to the weakening of pine sawtimber markets specifically challenging market conditions saw pine sawtimber stumpages prices decline from an average of 47 per ton from 20002006 to just over 23 per ton in 2011 or a roughly 50 decrease from 20002006 average levels this led many landowners to refrain from clearcutting a type of harvest which typically removes large quantities of pine sawtimber as they waited for pine sawtimber prices to improve however pine sawtimber stumpage prices never recovered and have held between 22 and 25 per ton since 2011 ultimately landowners returned to more normal management practices by 2014 with thinnings falling back in line with pre2007 trends the catchment area has also experienced some conversion specifically from 20002020 planted pine timberland increased more than 460000 hectares while natural hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland decreased a combined 390000 hectares note that the increase in planted pine timberland and decrease in natural hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland over this period were both gradual and occurred simultaneously this suggests a management trend in which natural timber stands are converted to plantation pine following final harvest its also important to note that there is little evidence that links these changes to increased demand from bioenergy as this conversion trend begun years prior to the startup of alabama pellets and continued nearly unchanged following the pellet mills startup diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 12 in the catchment area from 20122020 also there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused a diversion from other softwood pulpwood markets ie pulppaper also even though softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy is down 14 since alabama pelletsalicevilles startup in 2012 there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused this decrease rather the decrease in demand from nonbioenergy sources is due to a combination of reduced product demand and therefore reduced production and increased utilization of sawmill residuals an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices no the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville added roughly 450000 metric tons of softwood pulpwood demand to the catchment area from 20122016 and this increase in demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood ppw price over this same period ultimately the additional demand placed on the catchment area following the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville was offset by a decrease in demand from other sources from 20122016 and as a result delivered ppw prices remained nearly unchanged however the aliceville facility was shut down for a majority of 2017 due to the catastrophic failure of a key piece of environmental equipment and this was followed by alabama pellets strategic decision to transition to residualconsumption only beginning in 2018 which eliminated more than 360000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from 20162018 over this same period softwood pulpwood demand from other sources also decreased nearly 360000 metric tons so with the elimination of roughly 720000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from all sources from 20162018 delivered ppw prices in the catchment area proceeded to decrease more than 6 over this period since 2018 total softwood pulpwood demand has increased roughly 4 in the catchment area due to increases in demand from nonbioenergy sources and this increase that has coincided with a simultaneous 4 increase in delivered ppw price statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however the relationship between delivered ppw price and nonbiomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94 of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012 ultimately the findings provide evidence that ppw price is influenced by demand from all sources  not just from bioenergy or from pulppaper but from both furthermore note that alabama pellets shift to residualconsumption only beginning in 2018 resulted in no increase in pine sawmill chip prices as the price of pine sawmill chips in the alabama cluster catchment area rather decreased from 20182020 despite a more than 100000metric ton increase in pine sawmill chip consumption by the aliceville mill over this period a reduction in growing stock timber no from 2012 the year alabama pellets started up to 2020 total growing stock inventory increased an average of 26 per year 22 total in the alabama cluster catchment area specifically inventories of pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw increased 41 and 40 respectively while pine pulpwood ppw inventory increased 25 over this same period a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service usfs data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber in the alabama cluster catchment area increased from 60 in 2012 to 62 in 2020 suggesting that the sequestration rate of carbon also increased slightly over this period note that the increase in overall growth rate and therefore increase in the sequestration rate of carbon can be linked to gains in pine timberland and associated changes with the catchment area forest specifically growth rates decline as timber ages so the influx of new pine timberland due to the conversion of both hardwood forests and cropland has resulted in just the opposite with the average age of softwood pine growing stock inventory decreasing from an estimated 354 years of age in 2000 to 332 years of age in 2010 and to 322 years of age in 2020 total growing stock inventory decreased from 419 to 410 and to 404 years of age over these periods an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual timber removals provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2020 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood ppw the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 326 recall that a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels moreover note that the ppw gr ratio has increased in the catchment area since the aliceville mills startup in 2012 despite the associated increases in pine pulpwood demand in this catchment area pine pulpwood demand from nonbioenergy sources decreased more than 860000 metric tons from 2012 to 2020 and this decrease more than offset any increase in demand from bioenergy impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood ppw increased 25 in the catchment area from 20122020 and this increase in ppw inventory can be linked to both increases in pine timberland and harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area specifically pine timberland both planted and natural combined increased more than 185000 hectares in the catchment area from 20122020 over this same period annual harvests of ppw were 65 below maximum sustainable levels timber growth rates neutral the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber increased from 60 in 2012 to 62 in 2020 in the alabama cluster catchment area despite pine pulpwood ppw growth rate decreasing from 151 to 125 over this period however this decrease in ppw growth rate was not due to increased demand attributed to bioenergy but rather to the aging of ppw within its product group and its natural movement along the pine growth rate curve specifically usfs data indicates the average age of ppw inventory in the catchment area increased from an estimated 134 years of age in 2012 to 136 years of age in 2020 forest area neutral in the alabama cluster catchment area total forest timberland area remained nearly unchanged decreasing only marginally from 20122020 however pine timberland  the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production  increased more than 185000 hectares over this period and this increase can be linked to several factors including conversion from both hardwood and mixed pinehardwood forests as well as conversion from cropland specifically the more than 185000hectare increase in pine timberland from 20122020 coincided with a roughly 197000hectare decrease in hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland and a more than 8000hectare decrease in cropland over this period furthermore statistical analysis confirmed these inverse relationships identifying strong negative correlations between pine timberland area and both hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland area and cropland in the catchment area from 20122020 wood prices negativeneutral softwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy increased from roughly 80000 metric tons in 2012 the year alabama pelletsaliceville started up to more than 655000 metric tons in 2015 the year biomass demand reached peak levels however this roughly 575000metric ton increase in softwood biomass demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood ppw price  which averaged 2640 per ton in 2012 and 2639 per ton in 2015 ultimately the additional demand placed on this catchment area following the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville was offset by a more than 680000metric ton decrease in demand from other sources over this same period and as a result delivered ppw prices remained nearly unchanged also note that alabama pellets strategic shift to consume residuals only a transition that begun in 2018 and had been completed by 2019 resulted in a nearly 480000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand in the catchment area from 2015 to 2020 over this same period softwood pulpwood demand from other sources decreased more than 180000 metric tons in total softwood pulpwood demand from all sources decreased more than 660000 metric tons from 2015 to 2020 and this decrease in demand resulted in delivered ppw prices decreasing 5 over this period statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however the relationship between delivered ppw price and nonbiomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94 of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012 ultimately the findings provide evidence that ppw price is influenced by demand from all sources  not just from bioenergy or from pulppaper but from both markets for solid wood products positive in the alabama cluster catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products has increased an estimated 12 since 2012 and this increase in softwood lumber production has consequentially resulted in the increased production of sawmill residuals ie chips sawdust and shavings  byproducts of the sawmilling process and materials utilized by alabama pellets to produce wood pellets moreover the increased availability of sawmill residuals and lower relative cost compared to roundwood after chipping and other processing costs are considered led alabama pellets to make a strategic shift to utilize residuals only for wood pellet production beginning in 2019 so not only has alabama pellets benefited from the greater availability of this lowercost sawmill byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as alabama pellets has provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts read the full report alabama cluster catchment area analysis this is

sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  supply chain  forests  pinnacle renewable energy  forestry and forest management and arboriculture  biomass what is sustainable forest management 18 january 2022 sustainable bioenergy sustainable forest management is frequently defined in terms of providing a balance of social environmental and economic benefits not just for today but for the future too it might be seen as the practice of maintaining forests to ensure they remain healthy absorb more carbon than they release and can continue to be enjoyed and used by future generations to achieve this foresters apply science knowledge and standards that help ensure forests continue to play an important role in the wellbeing of people and the planet managed forests also called working forests fulfil a variety of environmental social and economic functions these range from forests managed to attract certain desired wildlife species to forests grown to provide saw timber and reoccurring revenue for landowners how are forests sustainably managed how forests are managed depends on landowner goals  managing for recreation and wildlife focusing on maximising production of wood products or both each forest requires management tailored to its owners or managers objectives there are many ways to manage forests to keep them healthy  there is no one size fits all  but keeping track of how they are doing can be tricky one alternative for monitoring forests is to use satellite imagery  one common sustainable forestry practice is thinning  which involves periodically removing smaller unhealthy or diseased trees to enable stronger ones to thrive thinning reduces competition between trees for resources like sunlight and water and it can also help promote biodiversity by creating more space for other forest flora the wood removed from forests through thinning is sometimes not highquality enough to be used in industries such as construction or furniture however the biomass industry can use it to make compressed wood pellets  a feedstock for renewable source electricity by providing a market for lowquality wood pellet production encourages landowners to carry out thinnings this practice improves the health of the forest and helps support better growth greater carbon storage and creates more valuable woodland fast facts forests cover about 30 of the worlds land surface absorbing around 16 billion tonnes of co 2 a year  42 of eu forests are covered by 3 rd party forest certification schemes through sustainable forest management annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million m 3 in 1953 to 408 million in 2015  what are the environmental benefits of sustainably managed forests through their ability to act as carbon sinks forests are an important part of meeting global climate goals like the paris agreement and the uks own target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 when managed effectively through thinning or active harvesting and replanting and regeneration forests can often sequester  or absorb and store  more carbon than forests that are left untouched increasing productivity and improving planting material harvesting trees before they reach an age when growth slows or plateaus can help prevent fire damage pests and disease so timing of final cutting is important though the vast majority of timber from such cutting will go to other markets construction furniture etc and secure higher prices from those markets being able to sell lower quality wood for biomass provides the landowner with some extra revenue sustainably managed forests also help achieve other environmental goals such as sustaining biodiversity protecting sensitive sites and providing clean air and water managed forests also have substantial water absorption capacity preventing flooding by slowing the flow of sudden downpours and helping to prevent nearby rivers and streams from overfilling wood from working forests also help tackle climate change in that highvalue wood from harvested trees can be used to make timber for the construction or furniture sectors these wood products lock up carbon for extended periods of time and the wood can be used at endof life to displace fossil fuels using wood also means materials such as concrete bricks or steel are not used and these materials have a large carbon footprint compared to wood what are the socioeconomic benefits of sustainably managed forests there are also social and economic benefits to managing forests sustainably managed working forests make vital contributions both to people and to the planet the commercial use of wood in industries like furniture and construction drives revenue for landowners this encourages landowners to continue to replant forests and manage them in a sustainable way that continues to deliver returns healthy forests can also improve living standards for local communities for jobs and helping to address unemployment in rural regions managed forests can also improve access for recreation on a larger scale sustainable forestry can offer a valuable export for regions and nations and foster trade between countries go deeper how a german miner laid the foundation for sustainable working forests more than 300years ago sustainably managed forests can act as substantial and effective tools for carbon sequestration  more countries

climate change and spurring a global transition to net zero emissions will require collaboration between science and industry new technologies and decarbonisation methods must be rooted in scientific research and testing drax has almost a decade of experience in using biomass as a renewable source of power  over that time our understanding around the effectiveness of bioenergy its role in improving forest health and ability to deliver negative emissions has accelerated research from governments and global organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergys role in achieving net zero on a wide scale the european commission has also highlighted biomass potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy sustainably managed forests frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission in charge of the european green deal has emphasised its importance in bringing economies to net zero saying without biomass were not going to make it we need biomass in the mix but the right biomass in the mix the role of biomass in a sustainable future moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables supporting wind and solar by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels will require flexible sources of generation such as biomass as well as other technologies like increased energy storage  in the uk the climate change committees ccc sixth carbon budget report lays out its balanced net zero pathway in this lead scenario the ccc says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of co 2 or equivalent emissions mtco 2 e per year by 2035 increasing to 25 mtco2e in 2045 foresters in working forest mississippi biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity such as aviation shipping and industrial processes the cccs balanced net zero pathway suggest that enough lowcarbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 twh of nonelectric power in 2050  compared to the 1000 twh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today however bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks a report coauthored by ipcc experts examines the scientific literature around the climate effects principally co 2 abatement of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices the report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products including biomass that replace greenhouse gas ghgintensive fossil fuels and by storing carbon in forests and in longlived forest products the role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels the addition of carbon capture and storage ccs to bioenergy to create bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently the negative emissions made possible by beccs are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels beccs and the path to net zero the ipccs special report on limiting global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy  coupled with effective landuse that prevents it contributing to deforestation the second chapter of the report deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the midcentury bioenergy use is substantial in 15c pathways with or without ccs due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels however its the negative emissions made possible by beccs that make biomass instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios the ipcc report highlights beccs alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation ar that comes with sustainable forest management are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 15 o c graphic showing how beccs removes carbon from the atmosphere click to viewdownload there are two key factors that make beccs and other forms of emissions removals so essential the first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hardtoabate emissions negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of co 2 that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero the second reason beccs and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic co 2 emissions what makes co 2 such an important ghg to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other to help reach the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to below 15 o c removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential in the uk the cccs 2018 report  biomass in a lowcarbon economy  also points to beccs as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement it suggests that power generation from beccs will increase from 3 twh per year in 2035 to 45 twh per year in 2050 it marks a sharp increase from the 195 twh that biomass without ccs accounted for across 2020 according to electric insights data it also suggests that beccs could sequester 11 tonnes of co 2 for every tonne of biomass used providing clear negative emissions however the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and beccs is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that as a minimum requirement maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time with increased attention paid to forest management and land use there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a winwin solution that can decarbonise power and economies while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester co 2  how bioenergy ensures sustainable forests biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable climate beneficial or low carbon source of power uk legislation on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its longterm capacity to produce wood this is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from landuse changes such as urban creep where vegetated land is converted into urban concreted spaces depends on a healthy market for wood products industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higherquality wood while lowquality waste wood as well as residues from forests and woodindustry byproducts can be bought and used to produce biomass pellets  a report by forest 2 market examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the us south where drax sources about twothirds of its biomass the report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the us south instead it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the regions forests a synthesis report  which examines a broad range of research papers published in forest ecology and management in march of 2021 concluded from existing studies that claims of largescale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the south east us are not supported the use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net ghg greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels according to forest research  importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing in fact the opposite is true with annual wood growth in the us south increasing by 112 between 1953 and 2015  delivering a winwin solution the european commissions jrc science for policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report  the use of woody biomass for energy production in the eu suggests a winwin forest bioenergy pathway is possible that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term while at the same time not damaging or even improving the condition of forest ecosystems however it also makes clear loselose situations is also a possible in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policyrelevant timeframes winwin management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity a winwin future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse naturally regenerated and dedicated industrial forests the report also warns of tradeoffs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions or vice versa these must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a loselose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations while beccs fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions in a future that will depend on science working in collaboration with industries to build a net zero future continued research is key to ensuring biomass can deliver the winwin solution of renewable electricity with negative emissions while supporting healthy forests tags biomass energy  sustainability  technology  forests
