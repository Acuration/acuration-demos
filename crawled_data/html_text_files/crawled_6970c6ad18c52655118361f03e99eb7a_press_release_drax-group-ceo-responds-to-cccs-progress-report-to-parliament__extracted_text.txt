assessment of progress in adapting to climate change 24 june 2021 todays ccc report is another reminder that if the uk is to meet its ambitious climate targets there is an urgent need to scale up bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs as the worlds leading generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to deliver beccs at scale than at drax in the uk we are ready to invest in and deliver this worldleading green technology which would support clean growth in the north of england create tens of thousands of jobs and put the uk at the forefront of combatting climate change notes to editors the first beccs unit at drax could be operational as soon as 2027 with drax capturing and storing at least 8 million tonnes of co 2 a year by 2030 beccs at drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help the uks most carbon intensive industrial area to decarbonise quickly and cost effectively greenhouse gas removals ggrs vital for net zero with beccs requiring a commercial scale plant by the late 2020s underpinned by a tranmsport and storage ts network progress towards delivering ggr targets will be reported in next years climate change committee progress report and in the meantime over the next year beis should develop policies on governance and support mechanisms to enable ggr scale up in the 2020s the cccs 2021 progress report to parliament  ccc progress report summary our assessment is that both engineered greenhouse gas removals ggr and landbased removals will be essential for reaching net zero a small number of beccs and daccs test facilities are presently in operation worldwide investment in research and development needs to be complemented with policy design to support engineered ggr scaleup during the midtolate 2020s a key milestone on the sixth carbon budget pathway is progress towards the commissioning of the first commercialscale beccs plant in the late 2020s this will need to be underpinned by the construction of co2 pipeline and storage infrastructures as part of the wider establishment of ccs in the early 2020s progress towards this underpinning infrastructure delivery and the development of support policies for ggr deployment will be considered in next years progress report in 2022  the net zero strategy should set out expected amounts and timings of landbased and engineered removals ie bioenergy with ccs beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs in contributing to meeting the sixth carbon budget and the net zero target these should avoid overreliance on these solutions building on the results of the beis ggr consultation policy on governance and support mechanisms should be developed over the next year in order to enable ggr scaleup during the midlate 2020s  this should include enabling domestic engineered removals to contribute to uk carbon budgets and net zero establishing ggr monitoring verification and reporting structures that ensure that ggr is sustainable and verifiable and setting out support mechanisms that align with the expectations for the role and timing of ggr contribution to uk emissions reductions share most
