Our communities

Our communities
At Drax, we want to make a lasting, positive impact in the communities and regions where we operate. We have a long history of engaging with a range of local stakeholders, from community service organizations to parish councils and Chambers of Commerce.


This year, we have strengthened our approach to supporting our communities, which encompasses active community engagement and local stakeholder relations, and a refreshed approach to philanthropic giving with the launch of the new Drax Foundation. At the heart of this approach is a commitment to being a good neighbour and playing a positive role in our communities.

Corporate Giving
Effective corporate giving is a key pillar of our community approach and reflects Drax’s commitment to being a good neighbour and making a positive contribution in the communities where we operate. We run a grant-giving program
and make charitable donations via the Drax Foundation, and the Drax Community Fund in
Canada,
the
US and UK
. This mirrors Drax’s operational footprint.


The Drax Foundation
The Drax Foundation was established in 2023 to provide grant funding for non-profit
organi
z
ations
and social enterprises that deliver lasting socio-economic impact in the heart of our communities. We
prioriti
z
e
organi
z
ations
that demonstrate an in-depth understanding of local conditions, and who represent the diversity of our communities. We disburse grants in the range of
up to $80,000
.

The Drax Foundation is a donor advised fund

administered

by Charities Trust (an independently registered charity with the UK Charity Commission, Charity No. 327489).

Drax Foundation focus areas


The Drax Foundation has two primary focus areas, which are underpinned by a commitment to advancing diversity, equality, equity and inclusion – particularly in relation to gender equality, indigenous communities, and underserved groups.

STEM education and skills development

Enhancing biodiversity and green spaces in local communities

Additional strength
Advancing gender equality
Supporting underserved groups and indigenous communities
The Drax Foundation is also committed to making a measurable contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have prioritized eight intersecting SDGs and will report annually on the contributions we are making to these Global Goals.

Drax Community Fund – local direct giving
In addition to the Drax Foundation, we also operate the Drax Community Fund. This Fund makes smaller donations to local projects in the communities where Drax operates. The funding is designed to be accessible and make a tangible difference in our local communities. Donations typically range from $500 – $10,000. Contact

for more information.

Providing humanitarian support for the war in Ukraine

Drax is funding the humanitarian aid effort in response to the on-going war in Ukraine. As a sign of support, we also lit up the cooling towers at the Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire with the colours of the Ukrainian flag
“Two Ridings Community Foundation provides vital support to local community groups and small charities. These grassroots projects are largely overlooked by national funders and often struggle to continue their invaluable work. With your support, we can reach the most vulnerable in our community and make a real difference to people’s lives.”

Jan Garrill, CEO of the Two Ridings Community Foundation

Skylark Nature Centre and Reserve, run by the Drax UK Community Team
