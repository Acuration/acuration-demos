power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station a solution for cheaper cleaner power why looking at the bigger picture could bring about more than 2 billion in savings thanks to renewable energy 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy britain has some big energy targets ahead of it  namely an 80 reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 figures a renewable energy future is not an optimistic target it is a necessary one but for this picture to also be a practical one it needs to be affordable a study from nera and imperial college london commissioned by drax suggests there are ways for renewable technology to be cheaper than it currently is in fact in one scenario they looked at there could be savings to the tune of 22 billion incentivising decarbonisation its a positive and necessary support mechanism however some renewable technologies like compressed wood pellets a form of biomass are excluded from participating in upcoming the auctions scheduled between 201720 why is this missing the bigger picture currently cfd support is based on how much a particular type of electricity costs combined with how much it takes to build and maintain the facility used to generate it this figure is whats called the levelised cost of energy lcoe the spanner in the works comes in that not all costs are considered in making this judgement powering a country requires more than just a power source we need ancillary services like backup power to get the country back on the rails in the event of largescale blackouts  and voltage control to ensure electronic devices continue to work and that power can move around the network the costs associated with these services  system integration costs sics  are excluded from the cfd equation sources like wind and solar being intermittent cant offer most of these ondemand ancillary services but we still need them to play a part in the uks energy supply biomass facilities can provide a number of these itself meaning it actually has a negative sic cost however in the current pricing system  ignoring these associated costs  biomass is considered more expensive than onshore wind and solar with the high sic costs for wind and solar included biomass is in fact the cheapest option finding the right mix this is not to say that solar and wind are not an integral part of a more renewable future a truly flexible low carbon high voltage electricity grid should be a mix of elements current rules do not look at the full picture and are ruling out important alternatives but there are possible solutions one could be unifying the markets there are four markets that feed into the uks electricity supply and theres little transparency or cohesion between them this leads to inefficiencies jens price wolf regulations and market director at drax explains solar is the cheapest renewable diesel is the cheapest option in the capacity market and gas will be the cheapest for energy production by considering each market as separate you end up buying the cheapest solution for that individual purpose rather than considering its performance across all this misses out solutions that can benefit the whole system biomass might be the second cheapest option in each field says wolf so supporting investment to upgrade existing coal power stations with biomass technology satisfies multiple needs and leads to it being ultimately cheaper than the old mix a single market approach that treats all technologies and generation methods in the same way could lead to significant cost savings and those savings could be passed on to bill payers in households and businesses while this could be a longerterm solution there are ways shortterm actions that can make a difference if the government were to include biomass in the mix for the next round of cfd auctions it could bring about savings of over 2 billion over the next 15 years or a 85 saving per household over the same period and it would do this while ensuring the grid remains adaptable without sacrificing emissions targets share related stories electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage
