carbon capture raising the standard in carbon removals 4 october 2023 opinion by angela hepworth commercial director at drax in their sixth assessment report the intergovernmental panel on climate change has clearly stated that to limit warming to 15c we will need carbon dioxide removals cdrs on a gigaton scale the magnitude of this challenge lays starkly before us but in equal measure with the size of the task its importance has never been more evident its long been accepted that the world must decarbonise by reducing emissions but the necessity of carbon removals is more newly recognised cdrs are now acknowledged to be a crucial part of the effort to achieve net zero emissions both to neutralise hardtoabate emissions and sectors like mining transportation and aviation and to remove excess historic carbon or overshoot already in the atmosphere at drax we are developing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously engineered carbon removal technologies like beccs are crucial to achieving longterm climate goals beccs is the most scalable of these technologies that can be deployed rapidly and is affordable compared with other permanent removal solutions credibility transparency and trust historically the voluntary carbon market has struggled with demonstrating credibility transparency and trust and this has proven to be a significant weight on the industrys ability to scale we have seen reports of lowquality offsets sold as high integrity credits and projects that dont deliver the carbon benefits claimed which has diminished investor trust in the market as a whole to address these concerns we are now seeing significant initiatives being put in place to implement the high standards and good governance in carbon removals credits that we need to effectively scale the market to levels required the integrity council for the voluntary carbon markets icvcm is a prime example of this serving as an independent governance body for the voluntary carbon market the icvcm is working to champion standards across the industry and has set out its core carbon principles ccps  set of principles that all carbon offsets and removals must meet in order to be considered high integrity we welcome this initiative and hope it will raise standards across the market similar to what we are seeing in the ai industry at present in order to build trust in this nascent market and in turn scale it it is also imperative that industry looks outside of itself and engages with other stakeholders who are impacted or interested in it we must develop ethical principles and guidelines for the design development and deployment of carbon markets implement transparent and accountable mechanisms for the oversight and governance of them educate and engage the public and stakeholders on the benefits of cdrs empower and protect the customers and foster collaboration and dialogue among the industry academia civil society and policymakers why we need standards for beccs at drax we already recognise that addressing quality concerns is the only way that the market will work for everybody  buyers rightly want to have confidence that they are buying a highintegrity removals which are robustly quantified and verified sellers need to be able to demonstrate the validity of their claims and government needs a wellfunctioning market and a baseline from which to regulate it our partnership with stockholm exergi and ecoengineers is doing just that  developing a worldleading methodology to ensure the integrity of beccs cdrs the methodology was created to align with the icvcms ccps and to closely consider how to ensure everyone around the table is getting what they need quantification for the methodology to be successful it requires a thorough approach to quantifying netnegative carbon removals from beccs quantification in the methodology starts with the gross volume of co2 we capture and store then subtracts any supply chain emissions andor emissions associated with the carbon capture and storage process as well as any leakage impacts increases in co2 emissions outside the project boundary we have intentionally developed this approach to be both robust and conservative so that beccs cdrs verified under the methodology are a truly net negative product guardrails it is also crucial in any methodology for beccs that there are robust guardrails in place to ensure biomass used comes from sustainable sources  for example from forests where the carbon stock is stable or increasing and excluding biomass sourced from sensitive areas where theres high levels of biodiversity our methodology also provides that any potential social or environmental risks must be evaluated and mitigated for biomass to be used verification we aim to register our credits with one of the major registries and once a methodology is adopted we will ensure that our credits are independently verified to confirm that they meet all the requirements set out in the standard and that there is robust governance in place for example to ensure credits cannot be double counted taking the methodology forward pioneering this work for beccs standards is an important step toward increasing investment in beccs cdrs  a climate critical technology  and it needs to be done collaboratively it has been developed in partnership with stockholm exergy and ecoengineers and we are now working to gather feedback from other stakeholders with the aim of making it comprehensive and representative as a part of this wed like to invite further feedback  from other developers standards bodies potential customers and others and welcome constructive comment on the text the methodology has also been submitted to the european commission to help shape their proposals for the framework for cdrs that they are developing it is in the interest of all parties to work towards common standards for cdrs to avoid current fragmentation of standards that causes confusion for customers and we appreciate your feedback on this important work as we drive it forward capturing the opportunity we have an opportunity to change our current climate trajectory but that will only happen if we take action now we to need to reduce emissions and rapidly scale the market for high integrity sustainable cdrs putting the required standards and governance into place to build a resilient and trustworthy carbon removals market is a core part of that we hope that this methodology has a part to play in that work and that it will bring us one step closer to manifesting the potential of beccs done well at scale read the methodology read the executive

september 2023 opinion by kasia wilk head of public affairs and policy for e urope and asia drax key takeaways certification of carbon removals provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes eus proposed certification mechanism is first of its kind but does not fully reflect the international dimension of carbon markets it is unclear how removals outside of the eu and certificates issued outside of the eu will be treated this might be problematic in the longer run  in particular in light of the foreseen enduses of the certified carbon removal units if the eu recognises and handles this challenge it could lead the world in carbon removals certification eu climate policies should prioritise support for carbon removal solutions that are technically ready economically feasible permanent and have additional cobenefits bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously sustainability of biomass is heavily regulated by the renewable energy directive red it is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world it applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against oversourcing why do we need carbon removals july was the hottest month ever recorded the impact of climate change is being felt here and now tackling the causes of global warming is now more pressing than ever we are currently on track for a 14 rise in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 this could lead to temperatures increasing by more than double the paris climate agreements 15 degrees target and bringing about even more extreme weather urgent action is needed now to revert this catastrophic trend its increasingly clear that carbon dioxide removal cdr will be essential to reach net zero by 2050 as these technologies balance out those emissions that are difficult to avoid as well as help companies remove their historic emissions they do so by capturing carbon dioxide co2 that is already in the atmosphere and removing it and storing it permanently according to the sixth assessment report of the uns ipcc nearly all pathways to net zero by 2050 will require a significant scaleup of carbon removals carbon removal technologies are developing at pace and can make a significant contribution to climate policies nevertheless to get the sector to where it needs to be by midcentury requires the right policies and investment to support deployment the eu has already taken a number of steps to support the development of carbon removals in the region the ccs directive establishes a regulatory framework for the geological storage of co2 and the proposal for a carbon removal certification framework crcf will support the development of a voluntary carbon market which is a cornerstone for the development of cdr however to support the scaling up of the sector it is essential to 1 assess the scale of removals required 2 define binding eu targets and 3 develop roadmaps for the scale up of carbon removals in europe it is also important to coordinate member state commitments ensuring their plans for deployment can be realised through greater cooperation the importance of certification certification of carbon removals is essential for driving technological development and deployment it provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes we need transparent and robust rules and procedures to ensure that only highquality removals and removals that would not have taken place are credited and to prevent the same activity from being certified twice or using the same certificate twice this is what the eu proposal for a regulation establishing a union certification framework for carbon removals aims to do the proposed certification mechanism is a worldfirst and positions the eu as the leader in the field addressing the need for removals in climate policy and providing a stringent transparent regulatory oversight on certification it has the potential to set highquality criteria create much needed standards for growing the carbon removal market and address many of the shortcomings that hamper its growth today yet the scope of the eu certification proposal does not go far enough it is currently limited to removals within the eu and it is unclear how removals outside of the eu and certificates issued outside of the eu will be treated despite the important international dimension of climate policy the european commission has said that international carbon markets can play a key role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions costeffectively although specifics are still under development the paris agreement provides a robust and ambitious basis for the use of international markets and reinforces international targets transparency and the accountability recognising the importance of international carbon markets article 6 of the agreement allows parties to use international trading of emission allowances to help achieve emissions reduction targets establishes a framework for common robust accounting rules and creates a new more ambitious market mechanism the lack of international consideration in the commissions proposals for certifying carbon removals could be challenging in the long run  particularly in light of the foreseen end uses of certified removal units including their international exchange through voluntary carbon markets to mitigate this the commission should consider two additional scenarios as part of the discussions on the scope of this voluntary certification framework credits generated outside the eu  eu businesses will still be able to use voluntary markets to purchase credits from projects in other jurisdictions outside of the eu these could not be subject to the same high standards unless they are being given the option to comply with the voluntary framework linking compliance markets  while integration of carbon removals with the ets framework is only being discussed and will be assessed by the european commission over the next few years this proposal should take account of future potential linking of compliance markets should removals be fungible in those linked ets markets it will be within the eus interest to ensure removals outside the eu are subject to the requirements and standards of the eu crcf how to assess and compare the existing cdrs methods all carbon removal methods will have a role to play however they all differ in terms of process permanence and technological readiness to reach its net zero targets eu climate policies should prioritise support for carbon removal solutions that are technically ready economically feasible and permanent they should take into account additional cobenefits for local communities power systems and the environment as well as the potential to be deployed at scale to ensure these technologies can make maximum contribution to the achievement of eu climate goals beccs is one of the best examples of this when compared to other technologies beccs is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously whilst generating thousands of jobs across its value chain it is also very well regulated sustainability of biomass is already covered by the renewable energy directive red the sustainability criteria for biomass in red were updated in 2023 and has been formally adopted by the european parliament it is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world it applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against oversourcing it also safeguards biodiversity ensures forest regeneration and sets strict limits on all supply chain emissions including transportation the 2023 revision of the red specifically took account of the projected growth in biomass demand to 2050 including for beccs and amended the sustainability criteria appropriately beccs projects will see carbon capture equipment installed in plants that will also produce power heat or fuels in many cases the technology will be retrofitted to existing plants regulatory consistency here will be paramount the detailed methodologies that will be developed under the certification framework will need to reflect the vast array of existing regulations such as red to support deployment of these technologies stimulate investment  and ascertain eu climate

the opportunities this represents for the group purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies that increasingly recognise the role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change the groups three strategic pillars remain 1 to be a global leader in carbon removals 2 to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets and 3 to be a uk leader in

latest report use significant volumes of carbon removals including beccs as a key tool for mitigating climate change the ipcc believes that globally up to 95 billion tonnes of cdrs via beccs will be required per year by 2050 in the usa the supportive investment environment created by the inflation reduction act is stimulating action and robust pricing for cdrs beccs  north america over the past two years drax has been progressing a number of work streams to develop its options for beccs with a primary focus on north america drax has continued to develop plans for a newbuild beccs power unit capable of producing c2twh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and capturing c3mt of carbon per year two initial sites in the us south have been selected and are progressing to option although the precise details remain commercially sensitive the two sites combined could enable the capture of c6mt of carbon per year by 2030 total investment would be in the region of 2 billion per plant with a target fid in 2026 and commercial operation by 2030 the capital cost reflects the construction of newbuild power generation as well as carbon capture and storage ccs systems the design of newbuild beccs enables a wider choice of biomass materials including nonpelletised material such as woodchips drax aims to locate new plants in regions which are closer to sources of sustainable biomass and ts systems to permanently store co 2  this is expected to significantly reduce the operating cost of newbuild beccs compared to retrofit as well as carbon emissions in the supply chain the group is continuing to evaluate nine further sites in north america creating a pipeline of development opportunities into the 2030s commercial arrangements the commercial model for us beccs includes power purchase agreements longterm cdr offtake agreements and a direct pay tax incentive under the inflation reduction act of 85tonne drax believes that the role of highquality permanent removals such as beccs and direct air capture will grow significantly as governments and companies take action to address their own carbon footprints in september 2022 drax announced a memorandum of understanding

has hired 80 employees across the us and canada and is in the process of establishing a global beccs headquarters in houston texas which will provide access to the highly skilled workforce needed to support the growth of this part of the group other developments in addition to newbuild beccs drax is currently developing an option for a project to add a carbon capture process to an existing pellet plant in louisiana the project would have the capacity to capture over 100k tonnes of co 2 per year from the pelleting process providing an early demonstration of the technology and creating cdrs which can help to stimulate this nascent market the project which has a capital cost in the region of 150 million is targeting fid in 202425 and commissioning in 2026 the group is also assessing options for beccs on existing nondrax assets and is continuing to screen other regions including europe and australasia capital allocation the group has previously outlined a fully funded plan to invest c3 billion in two beccs units at drax power station pellet production and pumped storage hydro today the group expands on this plan to include two newbuild beccs plants and ccs on a pellet

essential in reaching net zero  we must ensure they support high standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principles if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permanence of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principles proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principles include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permanence that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags technology  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture carbon removals is a global need the us is making it possible will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 20 october 2022 carbon capture key takeaways removing carbon from the atmosphere is urgent if we are to meet global climate targets the uss commitment to supporting carbon removal technologies creates an opportunity for new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power stations the market for carbon credits is gaining increasing credibility and verification making it a source of financing for ambitious decarbonization projects carbon markets are needed now to make investment into vital removals projects possible in the us and globally after a summer of soaring temperatures across the northern hemisphere the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in double the loss of tree cover than in 2001 while today more than 23 billion people face water stress from drought its clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too we believe that carbon dioxide co 2  removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge experts and governments agree that in addition to economywide decarbonization removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero co 2 emissions by midcentury the ipcc says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero thats a huge step up from the 40 million tons captured globally in 2021 but also a significant investment opportunity our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of co 2 through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs outside the uk per year while generating renewable baseload electricity and supporting healthy sustainable forests the likely contender for our first location the united states we already operate in communities across the us south employing more than 1200 people in our sustainable biomass pellet production  now we are preparing to build a new beccs power station in the region its clear to us that the us is an ideal market for beccs with its longrunning sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent co 2 storage we see the countrys efforts to retire coal by 2030 and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the us our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year while also generating 2terawatt hours of 247 renewable power the uss newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the inflation reduction act as well as the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent scenario planning for 100 clean electricity system are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies and a new frontier for permanent highquality emissions removals the need for high quality permanent emissions removals a net zero future is only possible through the widespread implementation of highintegrity carbon removals beccs offers this by combining low carbon renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure permanent carbon sequestration beccs works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 as they grow co 2 released in the generation process is captured and stored permanently and safely in geological rock formations the overall process removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it emits resulting in negative emissions this allows us to offer decarbonizing industries highquality carbon removals credits given the scale of co 2 that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero i believe this market for verified co 2 removal credits is a trilliondollar opportunity voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain however increased oversight from investors ngos and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity prompting sustained adoption by businesses will gardiner drax group ceo weve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at new york climate week the agreement with respira an impactdriven carbon finance business  will allow it to purchase 400000 metric tons of co 2 removals cdrs a year from our north american operations this would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own co 2 emissions reduction targets by purchasing cdrs from respira deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net co 2 emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified highquality emissions reductions as the global economy works towards its net zero targets co 2 removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today beccs stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality permanent carbon removals while also delivering baseload renewable power the ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies as they move away from fossil fuels the potential for the us driven by a dynamic mix of markets investors and engaged consumers some of the most prominent us companies are pledging to reach net zero investing in 247 renewable power and other means to do so technology companies like alphabet apple and microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations supply chains and even remove historic emissions other organizations like the first movers coalition include us companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving difficult decarbonization challenges  this industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action the recent inflation reduction act substantially increases the availability of the 45q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects increasing their value from 50 a ton of carbon removals to 85 per ton helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like beccs we believe the us is on the right track to create a market in which beccs can thrive the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent 100 clean electricity system report includes beccs in three of the four possible scenarios explored it forecasts the us will need between 714gw of installed beccs capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero co 2 emissions that equates to removals of approximately 55120 mt co 2 per year by 2035 the uss established forestry commercial industry with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample lowgrade wood and wood industry residues to power beccs the countrys longrunning exploration of co 2 capture and transport and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills supply chains and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects beccs is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology but action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality action is needed now for responsible businesses with the desire to go further faster or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes carbon removals from beccs deliver real verifiable and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond to net negative its encouraging to see the us pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market however carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community and in the environmental and civil society collaboration between governments corporations and ngos will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency we cant afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures buying and selling highquality permanent removals is the action we need today now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together tags technology  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  united states  carbon

cluster contributes 18 billion a year to the uk economy and supports 360000 jobs in heavy industry and manufacturing as demand for industrial products with green credentials rises and net zero targets demand decarbonisation businesses in the humber need to begin implementing carbon capture at scale the size of the humber and diversity of industries make it a significant challenge but if we get it right the humber will be a world leader in decarbonisation without investment in decarbonisation infrastructure the region risks losing its status as a world leading industrial cluster putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk when the iconic humber bridge opened in june 1981 it did more than just set records for its size it connected the region uniting both communities and industries and allowing the humber to become what it is today a thriving industrial hub that contributes more than 18 billion to the uk economy and supports some 360000 jobs as the uk works towards a lowcarbon future the shift to a green economy will require new regional infrastructure that once again unites the humbers people and businesses around a shared goal while the humber bridge connected the region across the estuary waters a new subterranean pipeline that can transport the carbon captured from industries will unify the regions decarbonisation efforts its infrastructure that will be crucial in helping the uk reach its net zero goals but also cement the humbers position as a global decarbonisation leader the humber bridge capturing carbon across the humber capturing carbon  preventing emissions from entering the atmosphere and storing them safely and permanently is a fundamental part of decarbonising the economy and tackling climate change aside from the chemical engineering required to extract carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial emissions one of the key challenges of carbon capture is how you transport it at scale to secure storage locations such as below the north sea bed where the carbon can be permanently trapped and sequestered  click to viewdownload engineers at drax power station at drax were pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology but carbon capture will play an important role in decarbonising a wide range of industries the humber region not only produces about 20 of the uks electricity its also a major hub for chemicals refining steel making and other carbonintensive industries the consequence of this industrial mix is that the humbers carbon footprint per head of population is bigger than anywhere else in the country at an international level its the second largest industrial cluster by co 2 emissions in the whole of western europe if the uk is to reach net zero the humber must decarbonise and carbon capture and storage will be instrumental in achieving that the scale of the challenge in the humber also makes it an opportunity to significantly reduce the countrys overall emissions and break new ground implementing carbon capture innovations across a wide range of industries these diverse businesses can be united in their collective efforts and connected through shared decarbonisation infrastructure  equipment to capture emissions pipelines to transport them and a shared site to store them safely and permanently economies of scale through shared infrastructure the idea of a co 2 transport pipeline traversing the humber might sound unusual but largescale natural gas pipelines have crisscrossed the region since the late 1960s when gas was dispatched from the easington terminal on the east yorkshire coast under the humber to killingholme in north lincolnshire further the uks existing legislation creates an environment to ensure they can be operated safely and effectively co 2 is a very stable molecule compared to natural gas and there are already thousands of miles of co 2 pipelines operating around the us where its historically been used in oil recovery a shared pipeline also offers economies of scale for companies to implement carbon capture allowing the humbers cluster of carbonintensive industries to invest in vital infrastructure in a costeffective way the diversity of different industries in the region from renewable baseload power generation at drax to cuttingedge hydrogen production  also offers a chance to experiment and showcase whats possible at scale the humbers position as an estuary onto the north sea is also advantageous its expansive layers of porous sandstone offer an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space the humber estuary but this isnt just an opportunity to decarbonise the uks most emissionsintensive region its a stage to present a new green industrial hub to the world a hub that could create as many as 47800 jobs including high quality technical and construction roles as well as other jobs throughout supply chains and the wider uk economy british innovation as a global export as industries of all kinds across the world race to decarbonise theres an increasing demand for products with green credentials if we can decarbonise products from the region such as steel  it will give uk businesses a global edge failure to follow through on environmental ambitions however will not just damage the clusters status it will put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk breaking new ground is difficult but there are firstmover advantages the products and processes trialled and run at scale within the humber offer intellectual property that industrial hubs around the world are searching for creating a new export for the uk but this vision of a decarbonised humber that exports both its products and knowledge to the world is only possible if we take the right action now we have a genuine global leadership position if we dont act now that will be lost through projects like zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster  alongside net zero teesside the regions businesses have shown our collective commitment to implementing decarbonisation at scale through collaboration as a track 1 cluster  the humber presents one of the uks greatest opportunities to level up  attracting global

sustainable business key takeaways tracking reporting and calculating carbon emissions are a key part of progressing countries industries and companies towards net zero goals as a newly established discipline carbon accounting still lacks standardisation and frameworks in how emissions are tracked reduced and mitigated the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol which lays out three scopes businesses should report and act upon carbon accounting evolves from reporting in the use of goals and timeframes in which targets are met timeframes are crucial in the deployment of technologies like carbon capture removals and achieving net zero how can countries and companies find a route to net zero emissions many organisations countries and industries have pledged to balance their emissions before midcentury they intend to do this through a combination of cutting emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere tracking and quantifying emissions understanding output reducing them and setting tangible targets that can be worked towards are all central to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  especially when it comes to carbon dioxide co 2  emissions and energy consumption reporting is already common practice and compulsory for businesses over a certain size in the uk however carbon accounting takes this a step further carbon reporting is a statement of physical greenhouse gas emissions that occur over a given period explains michael goldsworthy head of climate change and carbon strategy at drax carbon accounting relates to how those emissions are then processed and counted towards specific targets the methodologies for calculating emissions and determining contributions against targets may then have differing rules depending on which framework or standard is being reported against carbon accounting tools can help companies and counties understand their carbon footprint  how much carbon is being emitted as part of their operations who is responsible for them and how they can be effectively mitigated like how financial accounting may seek to balance a companys books and calculate potential profit carbon accounting seeks to do the same with emissions tracking what an entity emits and what it reduces removes or mitigates carbon accounting is therefore crucial in understanding how countries and companies can contribute to reaching net zero a new space how different organisations countries and industries approach carbon accounting is still an evolving process its as complex as financial accounting but with financial accounting theres a long standing industry that relies on wellestablished practices and principles carbon accounting by contrast is such a new space explains goldsworthy regardless of its infancy businesses and countries are already implementing standardised approaches to carbon accounting regulations such as emissions trading schemes and reporting systems such as streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr and the taskforce on climate related financial disclosure tcfd are beginning to deliver some degree of consistency in businesses carbon reporting other standards such as the ghg protocol have sought to provide a standardised basis for corporate reporting and accounting elsewhere voluntary carbon markets eg carbon offsets have also evolved to allow transferral of carbon reductions or removals between businesses providing flexibility to companies in delivering their climate commitments the challenge is in aligning these frameworks so that they work together for example emissions within a corporate inventory or offset programme must be accounted for in a way that is consistent with a national inventory to date these accounting systems have evolved independently with different rules and methodologies beginning to implement detailed carbon accounting upon which emissions reductions and removals can be based requires standardised understanding of what they are and where they come from reporting and tackling scope one two and three emissions the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol  this voluntary carbon reporting standard can be used by countries and cities as well as individual companies globally the ghg protocol categorises emissions in three different scopes called scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 understanding measuring and reporting these is a key factor in carbon accounting and can drive meaningful emissions reduction and mitigation scope one  direct emissions scope one emissions are those that come as a direct result of a company or countrys activities these can include fuel combustion at a factorys facilities for example or emissions from a fleet of vehicles scope one emissions are the most straightforward for an organisation to measure and report and easier for organisations to directly act on scope two  indirect energy emissions scope two emissions are those which come from the generation of energy an organisation uses these can include emissions form electricity steam heating and cooling a business may buy electricity for example from an electricity supplier which acquires power from a generator if that generator is a fossilfuelled power station the energy consumers scope two emissions will be greater than if it buys power from a renewable electricity supplier or generates its own renewable power the ability to change energy suppliers makes scope two relatively straightforward for organisations to act on assuming renewable energy sources are available in the area scope three  all other indirect emissions scope three is much broader it covers upstream and downstream lifecycle emissions of products used or produced by a company as well as other indirect emissions such as employee commuting and business travel emissions identifying and reducing these emissions across supply and value chains can be difficult for businesses with complex supply lines and global distribution networks they are also hard for companies to directly influence add in factors like emissions mitigations or offsetting and the carbon accounting can quickly become much more complex than simply reporting and reducing emissions that occur directly from a companys activities nevertheless these fullsystem overviews and wholeproduct lifecycle accounting are crucial to understanding the true impact of operations and organisations and to reach climate goals working to timelines setting goals with defined timelines and the development of rules that ensure consistent accounting is also crucial to implementing effective climate change mitigation frameworks throughout the global economy consider the uks aim to be net zero by 2050 or draxs ambition to be net negative by 2030 as goals with set timelines for many technologies the time scales over which targets are set have added relevance there are often upfront emissions to account for and operational emissions that may change over time take for example an electric vehicle the climate benefit will be determined by emissions from construction and the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power it a timeline of beccs at drax click to viewdownload looking at a brief snapshot at the beginning of its life say the first couple of years might not show any climate benefit compared to a vehicle using an internal combustion engine over the lifetime of the vehicle however meaningful emissions savings may become clear  especially if the electricity powering the vehicle continues to decarbonise over time this provides a challenge when setting carbon emissions targets targets set too far in the future potentially risk inaction in the short term while targets set over short periods risk disincentivising technologies that have substantial longterm mitigation potential delivering net zero some greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to fully abate such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture while other sectors like aviation will be incredibly difficult to fully decarbonise this makes carbon removal technologies all the more critical to ensuring net zero is achieved technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  which combines lowcarbon biomassfuelled renewable power generation with carbon capture and storage ccs to permanently remove emissions from the atmosphere  are already under development however it is imperative that such technologies are accounted for using robust approaches to carbon accounting ensuring all emission and removals flows across the value chain are accurately calculated in accordance with best scientific practice in the case of beccs its vital that not only are emissions from processing and transporting biomass considered but also its potential impact on the land sector forests from which biomass is sourced will be managed for a variety of reasons such as mitigating natural disturbance delivering commercial returns and preserving ecosystems accurate accounting of these impacts is therefore key to ensuring such technologies deliver meaningful reductions in atmospheric co 2 within timeframes guided by science accounting for net zero while carbon accounting is crucial to reaching a true level of net zero in the uk and globally where residual emissions are balanced against removals the practice should not be used exclusively to deliver numerical carbon goals to deliver net zero its vital we have robust carbon accounting systems and targets in place ensuring we reduce fossil emissions as far as possible while also incentivising carbon removal solutions says goldsworthy however many removal solutions rely on the natural world and so it is critical that ecosystems are not only valued on a carbon basis but consider other environmental factors such as biodiversity as well tags sustainability  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture why and how is carbon dioxide transported 11 april 2022 carbon capture what is carbon transportation carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture projects in the uk read the full story of how carbon is captured

negative emissions  carbon capture what is the carbon cycle 25 march 2022 carbon capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million tonnes of co 2 every year go deeper can carbon
