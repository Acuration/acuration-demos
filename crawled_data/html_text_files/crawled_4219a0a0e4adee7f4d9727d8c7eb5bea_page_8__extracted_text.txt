texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional opportunity for the uks biggest renewable power generator to deploy bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage beccus at scale in the mid 2020s from powering space ships in the 70s to offering greenhousegas free transport fuel cells continue to advance as lowcarbon electricity sources become more important theyre set to play a bigger role yet learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus why experts think bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will be an essential part of the energy system the science of safely and permanently putting carbon in the ground

storage  engineering  hydrogen  technology  transport how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from 11 june 2019 power generation the makeup of great britains power system changes constantly demand is always changing in winter it may peak at 50 gigawatts gw but overnight in summer it will be less than 20 gw some days wind is the biggest source of the countrys electricity generation other days its gas then there are days when for a few hours solar takes the top spot in the middle of the day and nuclear during the night in the past great britains electricity came almost entirely from big coal and nuclear power stations but as the need for decarbonisation has grown so has the number of sources feeding electricity to the grid creating an ever more complex and varied system made up of technologies that behave in very different ways for example some sources are weather dependent and cant generate all day every day others stop and start flexibly to smooth out changes in demand or intermittent generation but in the event all sources are available what dictates which sources actually generate and when the overriding influence is economics  the costs of starting up and running a turbine the price of fuel or taxes on carbon emissions in great britain electricitys wholesale price is not set in stone by an entity such as a regulator instead its negotiated via trading over the course of a day between generators power stations storage and wind turbines and suppliers who transmit that electricity to consumers as a result the price of electricity fluctuates every half hour responding to factors such as demand cost of fuels availability of resources such as sun and wind and carbon taxes for an example of the scale at which it fluctuates we can look at the period 14 june this year when the index price of electricity ranged from over 55mwh down to around 5mwh see chart above but while these figures speak to the overall price of a megawatt on the system they dont reflect all the individual sources nor their individual costs each of the multiple sources on the grid have their own operating costs fluctuating on a similar basis these changing prices give rise to what is known as the merit order a fluid theoretical ranking of generation sources this is not set by any regulator economist or even by traders rather it is a naturally occurring financial occurrence that explains what sources of electricity generation are feeding power onto the grid daytoday what is the merit order the merit order dictates which sources of generation will deliver power to the grid by ranking them in ascending order of price together with the amount of electricity generated this then determines the order in which power sources are brought onto the system ultimately suppliers want the right amount of electricity for the best possible price so in a system made up of many sources it is the lowest cost highest yield option that is brought online first which in theory helps keep overall electricity prices down north sea wind farm redcar this means it is often sources such as wind and solar which have no fuel costs that sit at the top of the merit order nuclear may come next as it continually generates a large amount of power for a low cost while taking a long time to turn down or off at the opposite end of the merit order are sources like coal and oil which have high fuel and carbon dioxide co 2  emission costs such as carbon taxes and the european emission trading scheme however the merit order isnt a set of hard and fast rules its an assumption used by traders or market commentators to guide what is likely to run and thereby the likely market price says ian foy drax head of ancillary services there is no published merit order it is like santa claus  it doesnt exist but it makes explaining christmas easier the intricacies of being in and out of merit if a generating unit is required to meet demand then its described as in merit if it is not required at any particular point in time then its out of merit  theres no point in suppliers paying for another power station for example to start generating if demand is already being met if the market is efficient we generate from the lowest cost source at all times says foy costs are not simple for example you have to take into account the cost of starting or shutting down generating units however costs are not publicly shared so theres no single view of the merit order each party has its own perspective on it it means the merit order changes from seasontoseason daytoday and hourtohour as rates of supply and demand and the availability of resources change dungeness nuclear power station in kent an obvious example is gas tends to be cheaper in summer than winter when its not being used for heating coal and gas also switch as global prices change says foy availability also changes over the year theres more solar in summer but none in the morning and evening peaks of winter there are also practical issues such as repairs being made on wind and hydro turbines or planned maintenance outages on thermal and nuclear power stations putting those generators out of action and knocking them out of merit and because the merit order is not an implemented working scheme it can be deliberately manipulated by outside forces one of the ways this is most clearly seen is in carbon pricing merit in a changing system the carbon price support tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain alongside the european emissions trading system have increased the cost of fossil fuel generation gas oil and coal levied as tonne of co 2 emitted this has the effect of pushing fossil generation down the merit order with coal emitting double the co 2 per unit of electricity compared to gas we can see how the merit order can be influenced to achieve environmental outcomes this has helped steer great britain towards record breaking coalfree periods and stimulated the building of low carbon generation sources other sources such as interconnection with europe and power storage facilities also slot into the merit order their position often shifts due to highly variable prices dependent on power generation in neighbouring countries or the amount of electricity that can be stored at a low cost respectively the grid is everchanging over the last two decades weve seen huge shifts in how power is generated and delivered this is unlikely to slow down in the near future but the merit order will remain like the grid it is in a constant state of change adapting to the many moving parts of the electricity system as long as great britain maintains its open electricity trading market the merit order will continue to dictate where the countrys power comes from tags carbon pricing  decarbonisation  electricity generation  renewable energy how close is great britains electricity to zerocarbon emissions 15 may 2019 power generation demand for electricity might have been 6 lower in the first three months of 2019 than in last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important because the decarbonisation needed to address the global climate change emergency cant be solved by one country alone for

racing to find ways to reduce their emissions but looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim negative emissions negative emissions technologies nets can actually absorb more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit and theyre vitally important for avoiding catastrophic manmade climate change without nets it could be impossible to achieve the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ambition of keeping temperatures under 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels one example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs it is what its name suggests using technologies to capture and store the co 2 generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere beccs holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry drax power station is currently piloting one form of this technology on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of co 2 a day but if it were deployed across all its biomass units beccs technology could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station beyond the power industry however theres scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably there are already five sites around the world where beccs is being trialled and implemented at scale laying the road to negative emissions storing co 2 from ethanol production in the illinois basin the ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of beccs including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world the illinois industrial carbon capture and storage project is part of a corntoethanol plant in the us that has the capacity to capture 1 million tonnes of co 2 every year  here corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygendeprived environment this process creates co 2 as a byproduct which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the illinois basin under the facility researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year norways cement challenge concrete is one of the worlds most versatile building materials as a result it is the second mostconsumed material in the world behind water  more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year however its key ingredient  cement which acts as concretes binding agent  is made using a hugely carbonintensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6 of all global carbon emissions the norcem cement plant in brevik southeast norway has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement which must heat ingredients to 1500 degrees celsius now its taking this a step further by becoming part of the countrys ambitious full chain ccs project the project will see 400000 tonnes of co 2 captured annually which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on norways western coast from here a pipeline will transport the co 2 50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the north seas bed the plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale the pipeline will be capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of co 2 per year  meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries burning waste and growing algae in a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial but combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions in japan however a biomassfired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions to get this project up and running toshiba the firm behind the project had to overcome unique challenges for example waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals than in ethanol or power production including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture now running at commercial scale the saga city waste incineration plant isnt just capturing co 2  its also utilising it to cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm  the carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products such as body and skin lotions carbon isnt the only thing finding new use at the facility reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 tokyo olympics the carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3000 tonnes of co 2 a year but it isnt the regions first deployments of beccs fully integrating beccs into biomass power nearby the mikawa power plant on the fukuoka prefecture is leading the race in asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station the 50 mw power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with toshiba at the time it was powered by coal however in 2017 the plant upgraded to a 100 biomass boiler fuelled by palm kernel shells  a waste product from palm oil extraction mills now its in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities with a target of being operational in 2020 the system  which after drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100 biomass feedstock  will have the capacity to capture more than 50 of the biomass plants co 2 emissions or as much as 180000 tonnes per year  japans government is now supporting efforts to develop co 2 transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year pulping wood and growing food beccs technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organicmatterbased industries but with many pulp and paper mills already using byproducts such as hog fuel  in generating power for their sites its a prime area for beccs growth in saintfelicien quebec commercialscale carbon capture technology is being deployed at a pulp mill run by resolute forest products and as of march 2019 had a capacity of capturing 11000 tonnes of co 2 a year rather than storage however it supplies the carbon to a cucumbergrowing greenhouse next door to the mill  as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25 of the greenhouses heating needs both long established biomassbased industries like ethanol and paper and new sectors like electricity are now adopting beccs technology and driving innovation the biomass feedstocks involved in beccs must however be sourced sustainably  or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere it should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way found a recent global biomass markets report from ricardo aea

done requires careful consideration and a detailed deliverable national strategy here we discuss the key issues in decarbonising heat the numbers the climate change act commits the uk to reducing its carbon emissions by at least 80 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2050 as heating our homes and workplaces is responsible for almost one fifth of our countrys total carbon emissions we are clearly

coming but what else will we need to change in order to transform our heating systems 1 more electrification the most noticeable change in the way we heat our homes and workspaces in the future may well come from the need to switch from systems that fuelled by natural gas to ones that are driven by electricity some technologies that can offer a solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating depend on a significant amount of electricity to keep the warmth flowing for instance the hybrid heat pump scenario which is currently supported by the committee on climate change would see up to 85 of a consumers need for heat being met by lowcarbon electricity to give some context to that figure according to the committee  85 per cent of the uks homes now rely on fossilfuel derived natural gas for heating and hot water and on average these currently emit around 2tco 2 per household per year which represents around one tenth of the average uk households carbon footprint changing from a situation where our heating depends on 85 fossil fuel gas to one that depends on 85 low or zero carbon electricity is little short of a complete transformation given that the new future homes standard is due to be introduced in less than six years this transformation will need to happen quickly of course a great deal of the extra electricity needed will come from intermittent renewables such as wind turbines and solar panels  especially as the cost of renewable electricity is falling  much of that power looks likely to be supplied by distributed sources rather than those integrated into the national grid indeed since 2011 power generation capacity connected directly to the distribution network grew from 12 gigawatts gw to more than 40 gw by the end of 2017 according to estimates from energy experts cornwall insight in a report for our b2b energy supply business haven power with so much of our electricity reliant on the weather there will still be a need for dispatchable and flexible thermal sources and energy storage such as drax and cruachan power stations  their centralised power generation can be turned up and fed directly into the national transmission system at short notice to keep our heating running and our homes warm dam and reservoir cruachan power station scotland such a transformation will obviously require careful strategic planning as well as an enormous amount of investment there may well be no single solution to the challenge of heat decarbonisation rather a number of different solutions that depend on where people live and work their individual circumstances the energy efficiency of their homes and the resources they have close at hand but while it has previously been reported that the overall or system costs of electrifying heating could be as much as three times the cost of using gas another study suggests that the costs could be much closer 2 more heat pumps heat pumps that absorb environmental warmth and use it to provide low carbon heating have always been considered a possible option for the four million homes and countless workplaces that are not currently connected to the uks mains gas network recently expert opinion has been changing with hybrid heat pumps seen as a workable solution even for homes and workplaces that are connected to gas supplies indeed in 2018 the committee on climate change stated that hybrid heat pumps can be the lowest cost option where homes are sufficiently insulated or can be insulated affordably this means that they may be one of the simplest and most affordable options to provide the heating of the future hybrid heat pumps draw heat from the air or ground around them and use a boiler to provide extra heat when the weather is exceptionally cold in a low carbon future that boiler could be fuelled by biogas in a zero carbon situation it could be powered by hydrogen heat pumps can be airsource ashp  absorbing warmth from the atmosphere like the heat exchanger in your fridge in reverse  or ground source gshp gshps absorb heat through on a network of pipes a ground loop buried or a vertical borehole drilled in the earth outside your home or workplace both ashps and gshps can be used to support underfloor heating or a radiator system though neither will provide water heated to the high temperature a natural gas boiler will reach to keep radiators hot and even though the warmth they absorb is free heat pumps depend on a supply of electricity to condense it and to bring it back to the heating system inside the house this electricity could be generated by distributed power from local solar pv wind turbines drawn from batteries or even from the low carbon grid of the future it is worth noting that the size of heat pumps and the amount of land they require  especially gshp  makes them a less attractive solution for people who live or work in built up areas such as cities while for those who live in blocks of flats it is difficult to see how individual heat pumps could be a practical solution 3 more hydrogen the idea of switching the mains gas grid to store and transport hydrogen has long appealed as a potential solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating renewable hydrogen could then be burnt in domestic boilers similar to those we currently use for natural gas the benefits are many hydrogen produces no carbon emissions when burnt and can be stored and transported in much the same way as natural gas provided old metal pipes have been replaced with modern alternatives and given the sunk costs involved in the existing gas grid and in the network of pipes and radiators already installed in tens of millions of homes hydrogen has always been expected to be the lowest cost option too however according to the committee on climate changes latest findings  hydrogen should not be seen as a silver bullet solution capable of transforming our entire heating landscape in a single change the main reasons they give for this judgment are the relatively high cost of the electricity required to produce sufficient hydrogen to power tens of millions of boilers the undesirability of relying on substantial imports of hydrogen and the lack of a carbonfree method to supply the gas costeffectively at scale hydrogen could however be produced by gas reformation of the emissions retained by bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs such as that being pioneered at drax power station carbon capture use and storage ccus of which beccs is the renewable variant is supported by the uk government through its clean growth strategy as it has potential to accelerate decarbonisation in power and industrial sectors extremely rapid progress to provide hydrogen in sufficient quantities from beccs is unlikely  but the first schemes could begin operating in the late 2020s hydrogen production also has the potential to radically transform the economics of ccus making it a much more attractive investment  it was originally assumed that the power required to drive the energyintensive process of hydrogen created via electrolysis would come from surplus electricity generated by intermittent renewables at times of low demand however that surplus is not now generally regarded as likely to be sufficiently large to be relied upon it is these limitations together with a comprehensive model of the likely costs involved in different approaches to decarbonisation that led the committee on climate change to suggest that hybrid heat pumps could provide the bulk of domestic heating in the future at present it seems likely that converting to hydrogenfuelled boilers will mainly be an attractive option for those who live and work near areas where the renewable fuel can be most easily created and stored the north of england is a prime example  close to the energy and carbon intensive areas of the humber and tees valleys where ccus and hydrogen clusters could be located with good access to north sea carbon stores such as aquifers and former gas fields 4 more solar many homes in the uk  especially in the south  could be heated electrically without carbon emissions at the point of use solar thermal for water heating or solar pvs for electric and water heating common sights on domestic property rooftops the intermittency of solar power need not be an issue as the electricity generated could then be stored in batteries behind the meter until it is needed however the lack of sufficient daylight for much of the year in many parts of the uk could together with the still relatively high cost of battery storage  still mean that this would not necessarily be a solution that can be applied at scale to millions of homes and workplaces all year round as the cost of battery storage continues to fall  it may well be that solar becomes a more practical and costeffective solution 5 more biomass more geothermal sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets and biomass boilers have long been proposed as a potential solution to decarbonising heating for the many people who live and work off the mains gas grid bioenergy as a whole  including biogas as well as wood pellets  now provides around four percent of uk heat up from 14 in 2008 the main barriers to this are the current relatively high cost of biomass boilers this is currently offset by the renewable heating incentive rhi which the uk government has committed to continuing until 2021 as this solution is adopted by more consumers it is anticipated that the real costs of such new technology will fall as economies of scale start to take effect in much the same way that solar pv and battery technology has recently become more affordable 6 more geothermal ruins of a tin mine wheal coates mine st agnes cornwall england geothermal energy uses the heat stored beneath the surface of our planet itself to provide the energy we need while in some countries such as iceland  geothermal energy is used to drive turbines to generate electricity that is then used to provide power for heating it is envisaged that in the uk it could be converted into warmth through massive heat pumps that provide heating to entire communities  especially those in former mining areas there is already one geothermal district heating scheme in operation in the uk in southampton  it is envisaged that such geothermal schemes would work most effectively at a district level providing zero carbon heat to many homes and workplaces according to a recent report  geothermal energy has the potential to produce up to 20 per cent of uk electricity and heat for millions at present drilling is being carried out to see if geothermal heating could be viable in cornwall  however there is no reason why it could not be used in disused coalmines too where ground source heat pumps gshps would absorb and condense the required heat this means that geothermal could have strong potential as a solution to the challenge of decarbonisation for former mining communities 7 more chp cory riverside energys resource recovery facility in belvedere london could be operated as a chp plant in the future by using the heat created in thermal renewable electricity generation  such as biomass  in combined heat and power schemes businesses and individuals can reduce their energy costs and their carbon emissions such schemes can work well for new developments on a district basis and are already popular in mainland europe especially sweden denmark and switzerland warm homes factories and offices there are already a number of viable solutions to decarbonising heating in the uk they rely on smart policy smarter technology and customers taking control of their energy rather than any one of these technologies providing a single solution that can help every consumer and business in the country to meet the challenge in the same way it is more likely that it will be met by a number of different solutions depending on geography cost and individual circumstances these will sometimes also work in concert rather than alone the uk has made solid progress on reducing carbon emissions  especially in power generation  when it comes to heating buildings rapid decarbonisation is now needed and that decarbonisation must avoid fuel poverty and help to rebalance the economy  find out more about

britain keep breaking renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides towards a low carbon future but challenges lie ahead records might be harder to break but it is important the momentum continues to move towards renewable sustainable electricity explore the quarters

and magnetism the relationship that makes the modern world work 30 january 2019 power generation locked in a parisian vault and stored in a double set of bell jars is a small cylinder of metal made of platinumiridium the carefully guarded lump weighs exactly one kilogram but more than just weighing one kilogram it is the kilogram from which all other official kilograms are weighed international prototype kilogram with protective double glass bell known as the international prototype kilogram or colloquially as le grand k the weight was created in 1889 and has been carefully replicated to offer nations around the world a standardised kilogram but over time le grand k and its clones have slightly deteriorated through wear and tear despite extremely careful use in an age of micro and nanotechnology bits of metal arent quite accurate enough to dictate global weighs and so as of may this year it will no longer be the global measurement for a kilogram  an electromagnet is part of its replacement an electromagnet is effectively a magnet that is turned on by running an electric current through it cutting the current turns it off while increasing or decreasing the strength of the current increases and decreases the power of the magnet it can be used to measure a kilogram very precisely thanks to something called a kibble balance which is essentially a set of scales however instead of using weights it uses an electromagnet to pull down one side because the electric current flowing through the electromagnet can be increased decreased and measured very very accurately it means scientists can define any weight  in this case a kilogram  by the amount of electrical current needed to balance the scale  this radical overhaul of how weights are defined means scientists wont have to fly off to paris every time they need precise kilograms beyond just replacing wornout weights however it highlights the versatility and potential of electromagnets from their use in electricity generation to creating hard drives and powering speakers the simple way to make a magnet magnets and electricity might at first not seem closely connected one powers your fridge the other attaches holiday souvenirs to it the former certainly feels more useful however the relationship between magnetic and electric fields is as close as two sides of the same coin they are both aspects of the same force electromagnetism electromagnetism is very complicated and therere still aspects of it that are unknown today  it was thinking about electromagnetism that led einstein to come up with his theory of special relativity  however actually creating an electromagnet is relatively straightforward all matter is made up of atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons spinning around them these electrons have a charge and a mass giving the electrons a tiny magnetic field  in most matter all atoms are aligned in random ways and effectively all cancel each other out to render the matter nonmagnetic but if the atoms and their electrons can all be aligned in the same direction then the object becomes magnetic a magnet can stick to an object like a paperclip because its permanent magnetic field realigns the atoms in the paperclip to make it temporarily magnetic too  allowing the magnetic forces to line up and the materials to attract however once the paper clip is taken away from the magnet its atoms fall out of sync and point in random directions cancelling out each others magnetic fields once again whether a material can become magnetic or not relies on a similar principal as to whether it can conduct electricity materials like wood and glass are poor conductors because their atoms have a strong hold over their electrons by contrast materials like metals have a loose hold on their electrons and so are good conductors and easily magnetised nickle cobalt and iron are described as ferromagnetic because their atoms can stay in sync making them a permanent magnet but when magnets really become useful is when electricity gets involved putting magnets to work running an electric current through a material with a weak hold on its electrons causes them to align creating an electromagnetic field because of the relationships between electric and magnetic fields the strength of the electromagnet can also be altered by increasing or decreasing the current while switching the flow of the current will flip its north and south poles having this much control over a magnetic field makes it very useful in everyday life including how we generate electricity find out how we rewind a generator core in a clean room at the heart of drax power station inside each of the six generator cores at drax power station is a 120tonne rotor  when a voltage is applied this piece of equipment becomes a massive electromagnet when steam powers the turbines to rotate it at 3000 rpm the rotors very powerful magnetic field knocks electrons in the copper bars of the surrounding stator out of place sending them zooming through the metal in turn generating an electrical current that is sent out to the grid the 660 megawatts mw of active power draxs unit 1 can export into the national transmission system is enough to power 13 million homes for an hour beyond just producing electricity however electromagnets are also used to make it useful to everyday life almost anything electric that depends on moving parts from pumping loud speakers to circuit breakers to the motors of electric cars depend on electromagnets as more decarbonisation efforts lead to greater electrification of areas like transport  electromagnets will remain vital to daily life into the future tags decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs  electricity  electricity generation  technology  transport how to get more evs on the roads 25 january 2019 electrification from school runs to goods deliveries getting from a to b is crucial to life in modern britain however a progress report by the committee on climate change ccc found that in 2017 transport was the largest greenhouse gas ghgemitting sector in the uk accounting for 28 of total emissions within domestic transport cars  vans and hgvs are the three most significant sources of emissions accounting for 87 of the sectors emissions a zero carbon future relies on a major shift away from petrol and diesel engines to electric transport a recent report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax examines the decarbonisation efforts of 25 major countries the report found the uk ranked sixth in sales of new electric vehicles evs in the 12 months to september 2018 and seventh for the number of charging points available the governments road to zero strategy outlines the countrys target for as many as 70 of new car sales to be ultralow emission by 2030 alongside up to 40 of new vans it has however been criticised by the committee on climate change as not being ambitious enough  a committee of mps has suggested 2032 becomes the official target date for banning new petrol and diesel cars  rather than 2040 called for in the strategy even as the range of evs on the market grows getting more lowemission vehicles on roads will require incentives and infrastructure improvements heres how some of the countries leading the shift to electrified transport are driving adoption expanding charging infrastructure one of major barriers to ev adoption is a lack of public charging facilitates coupled with reliability issues across a network that includes both old hardware and a plethora of apps and different connections  no one wants to set off on a long journey unsure of whether theyll be able to find a recharging point before their battery goes flat according to the energy revolution report there is one charger for every 5000 people in the uk compared to one for every 500 people in norway the leading country for charging points the scandinavian countrys government has invested heavily in its policy of placing two fast charging stations for every 50 km of main road covering 100 of the cost of installation government support has also been crucial in second and third ranked countries the netherlands and sweden respectively the dutch living lab smart charging is a collaboration between government and private organisations to use wind and solar to change vehicles while sweden has combined its klimatklivet investment scheme for both public and private charge points with experiments such as charging roads  china where half of the worlds 300000 charge points are located has issued a directive calling for the construction of 48 million electric charging points around the country by 2020  its also assisting private investments to make charging stations more financially viable the uks road to zero strategy is to expand charging infrastructure through a 400 million joint investment fund with private investors draxs energising britain report found the uk is on track to meet its 2030 target of 28000 installed chargers ahead of time however deployment still clusters around london the south east and scotland more direct government incentives or policies may be needed to balance this disparity and in the uk the scottish government is leading the pack with a 2032 ban on new petrol and diesel cars plus a range of initiatives including public charging networks and the switched on towns and city fund  charging points are necessary for electrified roads however its a chickenandegg situation more chargers dont mean more evs getting more evs on roads also requires financial incentive money makes the wheels go around putting infrastructure in place is one thing but the reality is evs are expensive especially new ones and cold hard cash is an important driver of adoption financial incentives have been a part of norways policies since the 1980s with the countrys high fuel prices  compared to the us for example further helping to make evs attractive current benefits for ev owners include no import or purchase taxes no vat no road tax no road tolls half price on ferries and free municipal parking there are also nonfinancial incentives such as buslane usage sweden the second ranked country for new ev sales in 2018 is a similar case where high fuel prices are combined with a carrotandstick approach of subsidies for evs and rising road taxes for fossil fuelpowered vehicles including hybrids the uk has had a grant scheme in place since 2011 but last year removed hybrid vehicles from eligibility and dropped the maximum grant for new ev buyers from 4500 to 3500  evs are also exempt from road taxes in april 2019 transport for london is implementing a low emissions zone ulez which exempts evs from a daily charge subsidies for both buyers and vehicle manufacturers have been a cornerstone of chinas policies with support coming up to around 15000 per vehicle  chinese ev buyers can also skip the lottery system for new license plates the country has in place to reduce congestion heavy subsidies have allowed the country to claim as much as 50 of the entire ev passenger market however it makes change expensive and the government is now preparing to find a more sustainable way of driving adoption preparing for transport beyond subsidies china isnt afraid to strongarm manufacturers into building more evs companies with annual sales of more than 30000 vehicles are required to meet a quota of at least 10 evs or hybrids  however the government has begun to scale back subsidies in the hope it will drive innovation in areas such as batteries robotics and automation which will in turn reduce the price for end consumers norway which owes so much of its decarbonisation leadership in lowcarbon transport to subsidies is also grappling with how to move away from this model as evs creep increasingly towards the norm the taxes lost through evs exclusions become more economically noticeable while the government says the subsidies will remain in place until at least 2020 different political parties are calling to make the market commercially viable  there is also concern the schemes only pass on savings to those who can afford new ev models  rather than the wider population who face higher taxes for being unable to upgrade its not just governments responsibility to make new markets for evs sustainable but for business to innovate within the area too drax group ceo will gardiner recently said his company must help to  ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution  thats a view welcomed by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum concerned not just about mitigating manmade climate change but also to ensure a just transition during the economys decarbonisation energy and clean growth minister claire perry spoke at an aldersgate group event in london in january its been very easy in the past for concerns about the climate to be dismissed as the worries of the few not the many luckily weve been able to strip out a lot of the myths surrounding decarbonisation and costs but we have to be mindful that this is a problem which will have to be solved by the many not just the middle class many countries have set ambitious targets for when the ban of new petrol and diesel vehicles will come into effect

the vital challenge of decarbonisation in earnest however not all are making progress at the same rate many are not implementing the agreement at the pace needed to mitigate climate change and keep the average global temperature increase well below 2 o c of preindustrial levels certainly not enough to limit the increase to 15 o c by 2050 which the majority of climate scientists believe is necessary for the planet is to avoid dire consequences last year even saw renewable energy investment fall 7  while the money going into fossil fuels grew for the first time since 2014 and data released by the international energy agency iea at the beginning of this months un climate change conference cop24 in katowice poland found that 2017 was also the first for five years seeing an increase in advanced economies carbon emissions  despite this there is much positive work towards decarbonisation a new report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax looks into the core areas and activities required to decarbonise the global energy system  and which countries are performing them to good effect in doing this the report also looks at how the uk stands in comparison and what steps countries need to take to truly decarbonise here are the key indicators of decarbonisation and how countries around the world are performing towards them dam in hardangervidda norway clean power at the forefront of reducing emissions and curbing climate change is the need to decarbonise electricity generation and move towards renewable sources last year the global average carbon intensity was 440 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatthour gkwh out of the 25 major countries the report tracks 16 came in below average with seven of these falling under the longterm 50 gkwh goal leading the rankings are norway france and new zealand which have a nearzero carbon intensity for electricity generation thanks to extensive hydro and nuclear power capacity at the other end of the table china india poland and south africa remain wedded to coal producing up to twice the global average co 2 for electricity generation this comes despite china having installed two and a half times more renewables than any other country  it now boasts 600 gigawatts gw of renewable capacity per person germany is leading the renewablesdrive with almost 1 kw of wind and solar capacity installed per person over the last decade despite this as much as 40 of its electricity still comes from coal part of the challenge in moving away from coal to renewables is economic as many countries continue to subsidise their coal industries to keep electricity affordable phasing out these subsidies is therefore key to switching to a lowcarbon generation system doing this works as demonstrated by the example of denmark which cut its fossil fuel subsidies by 90 over the past decade in turn successfully cutting its coal generation by 25 the uks carbon pricing strategy  which adds 16 per tonne of co 2 emitted on top of the price set by the european emissions trading system eu ets has led the carbon intensity of great britains electricity to more than halve in a decade it highlights how quickly and effectively these kinds of fees can make fossil fuels uneconomical since 2008 the uk has removed more than 250 gkwh from its electricity production carbon capture and storage in many future looking climate scenarios keeping the earths temperature below a 2 o c increase depends on extensive deployment of carbon capture technology  capturing as much as 100 billion tonnes of co 2 per year storing and using carbon is clearly forecast to be a major part of any attempt to meet the paris agreement but at present there are few facilities carrying it out at scale around the world today there are 18 largescale carbon capture and storage ccs units running across six countries with a total capacity to capture 32 million tonnes of co 2 per year mtco 2 pa another five facilities are under construction in three countries to add another 7 mtco 2 pa of global capacity in the uk drax power station is piloting a bioenergy carbon capture and storage programme that could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station  the usa has the greatest total installed capacity at 20 mtco 2 pa but per person it ranks behind norway canada and australia their smaller populations give them more than 200 kg of carbon capture capacity per person per year oil platform off the coast of australia these figures are well below the 100 billion tonnes the iea estimates need to be stored by 2060 to prevent temperatures reaching 2 o c more however considering the us alone has a potential storage capacity of more than 10 trillion tonnes of co 2  the potential of storage is not expected to be a problem using depleted oil or natural gas fields as storage for captured carbon is being explored in a number of regions with the us establishing several projects with more than 1 million tonnes in capacity in 2019 australia will open the worlds largest co 2 store with the capacity to capture between 34 million and 4 million tonnes a year from chevrons gorgon gas facility  considering the storage capacity available globally its a matter of deploying the necessary technology for ccs to have a significant impact on emissions and global warming the uk is perhaps a typical example of where ccs is at present with estimated storage capacity of 70 billion tonnes as much as half of the entire eu combined by repurposing north sea oil and gas fields in partnership with norway the uk could pool its carbon storage capacity electrification electricity generation is one of the main targets for emissions reductions globally as a result of the progress thats been made in this field many futurelooking scenarios highlight the important of electrification in other sectors such as transport in turn making them less carbon intensive transport is leading the charge globally  there are now 10 different countries where one of every 50 new vehicles sold is electric in norway this ratio is almost one in two thanks in part to generous tax exemptions as well as nonfinancial incentives like access to bus lanes and halfprice ferries perhaps surprisingly china is the worlds largest electric vehicle ev market it may still use significant amounts of coal but its commitment to reducing urban air pollution has seen it push evs heavily and it now accounts for 50 of the global battery ev market on its own chinese electric car charging stations of course adoption of evs requires the supporting infrastructure to be truly successful in conjunction with its high sales norway leads the way in charging points per capita with one for every 500 people this compares to one charger for every 5000 people in the uk and one for every 10000 people in china electrification also affects the energy intensity of countrys transport systems and while it may be the largest ev market chinas rise in private vehicles has been largely driven by petrol and diesel models the result is the largest increases in transport energy intensity and emissions has taken place in china indonesia and india respectively domestic energy intensity is also rising in china indonesia and south africa as greater numbers of people gain access to appliances and home comforts conversely in europe portugal germany and the netherlands have all seen their domestic energy intensity drop in the last decade however this may be the lingering effect of the 2008 recession rather than longterm efficiency improvements the efficiency of industrial processes is also an important barometer in decarbonisation activities like mining and manufacturing require heavyduty dieselpowered machinery and often coalpowered generators especially in bric nations the exception is china where plans to get the 1000 most energyintensive companies to reduce their energy consumption per unit of gdp produced by 20 over the last five years has proved fruitful norways heavilyelectrified industries however are still energy intensive and its level of carbon intensity is vulnerable to fluctuations in power generation prices electrification and reduced emissions require government policies to put in motion behavioural changes that can lead to lasting decarbonisation  robust carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future  drax group ceo will gardiner commented recently  welcoming
