Negative emissions
What are negative emissions?
21 August 2020
Carbon capture

What are negative emissions?
In order to meet the long-term climate goals laid out in the Paris Agreement, there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air, but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide (CO
2
) currently in the atmosphere, and the CO
2
that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise.
The process of greenhouse gas removal (GGR) or CO
2
removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is possible through
negative emissions
, where more CO
2
is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere. Negative emissions can be achieved through a range of nature-based solutions or through man-made technologies designed to remove CO
2
at scale.
What nature-based solutions exist to remove
CO
2
from the atmosphere?
One millennia-old way of achieving negative emissions is
forests
. Trees absorb carbon when they grow, either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen, or storing it over their lifetime. This makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere.
Planting new forests
and
regenerating forests
has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result.
However, this can also go beyond forests on land. Vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store CO
2
, and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much
carbon as forests on land
– an approach to negative emissions called ‘blue carbon’.

Did you know?
Bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world
– its thick forests absorb three times the amount of CO
2
the small country emits.
What man-made technologies can deliver negative emissions?
Many scientists and experts
agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
(BECCS). This approach uses biomass – sourced from sustainably managed forests – to generate electricity. As the forests used to create biomass absorb CO
2
while growing, the CO
2
released when it is used as fuel is
already accounted for
, making the whole process low carbon.
By then capturing and storing any CO
2
emitted (often in safe underground deposits),
the process of electricity generation
becomes
carbon negative
, as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added.
Direct air carbon capture
and storage (DACCS) is an alternative technological solution in which CO
2
is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used. While this could hold huge potential, the technology is currently in its infancy, and
requires substantial investment
to make it a more widespread practice.
The process of removing CO
2
from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions, because more CO
2
is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it.
How much negative emissions are needed?
According to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
, negative emissions technologies could be required to capture
20 billion tonnes
of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050.
Negative emissions fast facts
Humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere (the crust of the earth) to the biosphere (where we live) at
100
times the rate of the natural carbon cycle
There is enough sustainable biomass available to the UK to support BECCS to remove
51 megatonnes of CO
2
every year by 2050, according to the Committee on Climate Change

What is carbon capture usage and storage?
Carbon capture

What is carbon capture usage and storage?
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a large-scale source – for example, a
power station
or factory – and then permanently storing them.
Carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) is where captured carbon dioxide (CO
2
) may be used, rather than stored, in other industrial processes or even in the
manufacture of consumer products
.
How is carbon captured?
Carbon can be captured either
pre-combustion
, where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used, or
post-combustion
, where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned.
Pre-combustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being
converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide
under heat pressure. The separated CO
2
is
captured and transported to be stored or used.
Post-combustion carbon capture
uses the addition of other materials (such as solvents) to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned. The isolated carbon is then transported (normally via pipeline) to be stored permanently –  usually deep underground – or used for other purposes.
Carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that CO
2
is not released into the atmosphere.

What can the carbon be used for?
Once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways. For example, material including
carbon nanofibres and bioplastics
can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles, while
several start-ups
are developing methods of turning captured CO
2
into animal feed.
Captured carbon can even
assist in the large-scale production of hydrogen
, which could be used as a carbon-neutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation.
Where can carbon be stored?
Carbon can be stored in geological reserves
, commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, or ‘unmineable’ coal beds. The process of storage is referred to as sequestration.
The underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through
mineral storage
, where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new, solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored.
Carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage.
According to the Global CCS Institute
, over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the USA, Norway and Brazil.

What are the benefits of carbon storage?
CO
2
is a greenhouse gas, which traps heat in our atmosphere, and therefore contributes to global warming. By capturing and storing carbon, it is being taken out of the atmosphere, which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change.

What is decarbonisation?
Carbon capture

What is decarbonisation?
Decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide (CO
2
) output of a country’s economy. This is usually done by decreasing the amount of CO
2
emitted across the active industries within that economy.

Why is decarbonisation important?
Currently, a wide range of sectors – industrial, residential and transport – run largely on
fossil fuels
, which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal, oil or gas.
The CO
2
emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping in heat and contributing to global warming. By using alternative sources of energy, industries can reduce the amount of CO
2
emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change.
Why target carbon dioxide?

There are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, however CO
2
is the most prevalent. As of 2018, carbon levels are the highest they’ve been in
800,000 years
.
The Paris Agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions, with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures don’t rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level.
With
195 current signatories
, economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon, with the
UK leading the G20 nations
in decarbonising its economy in the 21
st
century.
How is decarbonisation carried out?
There are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries, as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere.
Decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power, such as wind turbines,
solar
panels and coal-to-
biomass upgrades
, meaning that homes and businesses don’t have to rely on fossil fuels. Other innovations, such as
using batteries
and allowing homes to generate and share their own power, can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation. As the electricity itself is made cleaner, it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process.
Other approaches, such as reforestation or
carbon capture and storage
, help to pull existing carbon from the air, to
neutralise carbon output
, or in some cases, help to make electricity generation – and
even entire nations
– carbon negative.
Alternative power options means that homes and businesses don’t have to rely on traditional carbon fuels.
What is the future of decarbonisation?
For decarbonisation to be more widely adopted as a method for combating climate change, there needs to be
structural economical change
, according to Deloitte Access Economics. Creating more room for decarbonisation through investing in alternative energies means that “there are a multitude of job-rich, shovel-ready, stimulus opportunities that also unlock long-term value”.

Is Formula One on the road to a big clean-up?
26 June 2020
Electrification

On the eve of the new F1 season, the motor sport faces an existential dilemma. While the Covid-19 pandemic has inflicted huge uncertainty throughout 2020, environmental concerns continue to question its long-term viability.
The Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne has long been the curtain-raiser to eight months of gas-guzzling, decibel-deafening action on racetracks across the globe, contributing to a carbon footprint of 256,551 tonnes. Due to the season being delayed, the first race will now take place in Austria. But the focus on Australia has been sharpened by the New Year bushfires – visible evidence, say some scientists and environmentalists, of the climate crisis.  This adds fuel to the fiery debate on Formula One’s perceived failure to take its environmental responsibilities seriously.
Koala bear on eucalyptus branch escaping from Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020.
Significantly, it is not the cars doing 70 laps that generate most of F1’s emissions but the thousands of air miles covered by drivers, their teams, the media and spectators in getting to each race weekend:
Activity

🚚  Logistics (road, air and sea freight)

🎤  Events

🏎  Total F1 car emissions including all race and test mileage

Carbon footprint of F1 in 2018, not including fans’ transport to races
But is a genuine shift in attitudes about to descend on the circuits of Monaco, Silverstone and Interlagos? Firstly, a raft of countries have announced plans to
phase out petrol and diesel-powered engines between 2030 and 2050
. This could force the hand of motorsport bosses who have long been accused of talking a good game but failing to act.
The sport recently announced a
pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030
and in pursuit of this goal, it is looking to introduce two-stroke engines that run on synthetic fuel by the mid-2020s while current F1 hybrid engines will be replaced by a new specification of power unit from 2025 or 2026.
Max Verstappen, Formula One driver
Currently, under
Article 19.4.4
of the FIA’s 2019 technical regulation for F1 a minimum of 5.75% of the fuel must comprise bio‐components. The sport wants to reach 100%, aiming for 10% in 2021 and a gradual subsequent increase.
Such developments could potentially seize upon the opportunities offered by companies pioneering the use of
carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS)
, such as Drax.
One of several ideas discussed to make the sport more sustainable has been capturing carbon that is then mixed with hydrogen from water to form liquid fuel. Such technology is in development and Drax is researching how carbon dioxide (CO
2
) can be used to produce fuels. Its innovation engineers recently met with Velocys, the fuels technology company, which
plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the Humber.
Could F1 go electric?
While greener fuels are the most obvious way forward, there have been calls for alternative forms of energy to be used to power F1 cars. A hydrogen solution could be developed quickly but it would significantly increase the bulkiness and weight of cars. But what about electric?
Formula One race car
“Electric power is attractive, but it’s currently still quite difficult to scale that up,” Pat Symonds, Chief Technical Officer at Formula One, said in
an interview
. “With any of the technologies on the horizon at the moment an electric truck or an electric aircraft is not a particularly feasible product. So, there is still a case for having liquid hydrocarbon fuels in trucks and in aircraft. However, what we cannot do is carry on digging those out of the ground, we’re going to have to somehow synthesise them and that’s what we want Formula 1 to explore and hopefully to lead.”
Formula E set to challenge F1 dominance
Another driver of change looming larger in Formula One’s rear-view mirror is Formula E. While this fledgling sport’s claim to quieter cars may not appeal to the most hardened of petrol-head F1 fans, its credible narrative of boosting sustainability in each of the 12 cities that host its races is always a potential attraction to new generations of increasingly climate conscious young fans.
Take Formula E’s opening race in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the country’s most polluted city. The sport is a beneficiary of the kingdom’s aim to reduce its reliance oil and in the last six years, the Middle Eastern country has invested over $350 billion in renewable energy projects (mainly solar and wind).

As with all electric cars, there are challenges. Excess heat produced by electric motors is offset by reducing the performance of the car when it is too hot. A series of cooling systems using radiators and fluid in closed loops regulate temperatures to a satisfactory level.
Appealing to fans is critical for the sport’s prosperity. Sustainability credentials are a key strand but Formula E is going beyond that and looking to optimise raceday experience through features such as FanBoost. This is an online voting system where the three drivers voted as fans’ favourites get a five second power boost of 100kj which can provide serious assistance when a car overtakes.
Maybe this is just one innovation that F1 could learn from its much younger counterpart? Perhaps there is also a case for taking the best of what both have to offer – the cities, the cars and the technology – and merging into a single championship. Whatever lies ahead in the future, Formula One is aware of the need to change. It must do if it is to survive.

How do you store CO2 and what happens to it when you do?
22 April 2020
Carbon capture

The North Sea has long shaped British trade. It’s also been instrumental in how the country is powered, historically providing an abundant source of oil and natural gas. However, this cold fringe off the North Atlantic could also play a vital role in decarbonising the UK’s economy – not because of its full oil and gas reservoirs, but thanks to its empty ones.
In an effort to limit or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) in the atmosphere, countries around the world are rushing towards large scale carbon capture usage and storage projects (CCUS). In this process, CO
2
is captured from sources, such as energy production and manufacturing, or directly removed from the air, and reused or stored permanently – for example, underground in disused oil and gas reservoirs or other suitable geological formations.

, Global CCS Institute [Click to view/download]
The International Energy Agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of CO
2
must be stored by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. Yet the
Global CCS Institute
reports that, as of 2019, the projects currently in operation or under construction had the capacity to capture and store only 40 million tonnes of CO
2
per year.
It’s clear the
global capacity for CCUS
must accelerate rapidly in the coming decade, but it raises the questions: where can these millions of tonnes of CO
2
be stored, and what happens to it once it is?
Where can you store CO
2
?
The most well-developed approach to storing CO
2
is injecting it underground into naturally occurring, porous rock formations such as former natural gas or oil reservoirs, coal beds that can’t be mined, or saline aquifers. These are deep geological formations with deposits of very salty water present in the rock’s pores and most commonly found under the ocean. The North Sea and the area off the US Gulf Coast contain several saline aquifers.
Once
CO
2
has been captured using CCUS technology
, it’s pressurised and turned into a liquid-like form known as ‘supercritical CO
2
’. From there it’s transported via pipeline and injected into the rocks found in the formations deep below the earth’s surface. This is a process called geological sequestration.

But while pumping CO
2
into the ground is one thing, ensuring it stays there and isn’t released into the atmosphere is another. Fortunately, there are several ways to ensure CO
2
is stored safely and securely.
Keeping the lid on CO
2
stored underground
Put simply, the most straightforward way underground reservoirs store CO
2
is through the solid impermeable rock that typically surrounds them. Once CO
2
is injected into a reservoir, it slowly moves upwards through the reservoir until it meets this layer of impermeable rock, which acts like a lid the CO
2
cannot pass through. This is what’s referred to as ‘structural storage’ and is the same mechanism that has kept oil and gas locked underground for millions of years.
White chalk stone
Over time, the CO
2
trapped in reservoirs will often begin to chemically react with the minerals of the surrounding rock. The elements bind to create solid, chalky minerals, essentially locking the CO
2
into the rock in a process called ‘mineral storage’.
In the case of saline aquifers, as well as structural and mineral storage, the CO
2
can dissolve into the salty water in a process called ‘dissolution storage’. Here, the dissolved CO
2
slowly descends to the bottom of the aquifer.
In any given reservoir, each (or all) of these processes work to store CO
2
indefinitely. And while there remains some possibility of CO
2
leakage from a site, research suggests it will be minimal. One study, published in the journal Nature, suggests more than 98% of injected CO
2

will remain stored
for over 10,000 years.
Storage for the net zero future
In the United States, industrial scale storage is in action in Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma and Illinois, and there are projects in progress across the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Algeria and Canada. However, there is still a long way to go for CCUS to reach the scale it needed to limit the effects of climate change.
Research
has shown that globally, there is an abundance of CO
2
storage sites, which could support widespread CCUS adoption. A
report
compiled by researchers at Imperial College London and E4tech and published by Drax details an estimated 70 billion tonnes of storage capacity in the UK alone. The US, on the other hand, has an estimated storage capacity of 10 trillion tonnes.
It’s clear the capacity for storage is present, it now remains the task of governments and companies to ramp up CCUS projects to begin to reach the scale necessary.

In the UK, Drax Power Station is
piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage projects
(BECCS), which could see it becoming the world’s first negative emissions power station. As part of the
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership, it could also form a part of the world’s first zero carbon industrial hub in the north of the UK.
Such projects are indicative of the big ambitions CCUS technology could realise – not just decarbonising single sites, but capturing and storing CO
2
from entire industries and regions. There is still a way to go to meet that ambition, but it is clear the resources and knowledge necessary to get there are ready to be utilised.

Negative emissions


The UK needs negative emissions from BECCS to reach net zero – here’s why
7 April 2020
Carbon capture

Reaching the UK’s target of
net zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy, from shops to super computers, must reduce its carbon footprint – all the way down their supply chains – as close to zero as possible.
But as the country transforms, one thing is certain: demand for electricity will remain. In fact, with increased electrification of heating and transport, there will be a greater demand for power from renewable, carbon dioxide (CO
2
)-free sources. Bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer
essential grid-stability
services, as provided by
Drax Power Station
in North Yorkshire.

Beyond just power generation, more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero UK. And that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or BECCS.
A

carbon negative source of power, abating emissions from other industries
The
Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says negative emissions are essential
for the UK to offset difficult-to-decarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target. This may include direct air capture (DAC) and other
negative emissions technologies
, as well as BECCS.
BECCS power generation uses
biomass grown in sustainably managed forests
as fuel to generate electricity. As these forests absorb CO
2
from the atmosphere while growing, they offset the amount of CO
2
released by the fuel when used, making the whole power production process carbon neutral. Adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more CO
2
from the atmosphere than is emitted, making it
carbon negative
.
Pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the US South where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets
This means BECCS can be used to abate, or offset, emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises. A report by
The Energy Systems Catapult, modelling different approaches for the UK to reach net zero by or before 2050
, suggests carbon-intensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will
always
produce residual emissions.
The need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero. While the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) will also play an important role in bringing CO
2
levels down, it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed.
Meanwhile, carbon capture use and storage
(CCUS) technology is already deployed at scale
in Norway, the US, Australia and Canada. These processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation, such as at Drax Power Station, which means BECCS is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today.
As well as counteracting remaining emissions, however,
BECCS can also help to decarbonise other industries
by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel: hydrogen.
Enabling a hydrogen economy
The CCC’s ‘
Hydrogen in a low-carbon economy report
’ highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels – in particular, hydrogen or H
2
.
Hydrogen produced in a test tube
When combusted, hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour, while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today. Hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid, which, coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport.
There are various ways BECCS can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy. Most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification. In this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700°C but prevented from combusting. This causes the material to break down into gases: hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). The CO then reacts with water to form CO
2
and more H
2
.
While CO
2
is also produced as part of the process, biomass material absorbs CO
2
while it grows, making the overall process carbon neutral. However, by deploying carbon capture here, the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative.
BECCS can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production. The
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership envisages Drax Power Station as the anchor project for CCUS infrastructure in the region, allowing for the production of ‘blue’ hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas, a fossil fuel. However, the resulting carbon emissions could be captured. The CO2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the North Sea as used by BECCS facilities at Drax.
This way of clustering BECCS power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures, steel mills and refineries, to decarbonise.
Lowering the cost of flexible electricity
One of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition.
The Energy Systems Catapult’s analysis found that it could be kept as low as 1-2% of GDP, while a report by the
National Infrastructure Commission (NIC)
projects that deploying BECCS would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential.
The NIC’s modelling found, when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources, BECCS would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future. This would maximise its negative emissions potential.
This means BECCS units would run frequently and for long periods, uninterrupted by changes in the weather, rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand. This, coupled with its ability to abate emissions, means BECCS – alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar – could provide the UK with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations.
The report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogen-fuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible back-up electricity, which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants.
However, for this to work effectively, decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the UK takes to shape the energy system before 2050.
The time to act is now
What is consistent across many different reports is that BECCS will be essential for any version of the future where the UK reaches net zero by 2050. But, it will not happen organically.

A joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering
Greenhouse Gas Removal report
, includes research into BECCS, DACCS and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the UK to reach net zero. It also calls for the UK to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for CO
2
storage in locations such as the North Sea, as well as its engineering expertise, to establish the infrastructure needed for CO
2
transport and storage.
However, this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical. A report by
Vivid Economics for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)
highlights that – just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the UK’s energy mix – BECCS and other technologies, need the same clear, long-term strategy to enable companies to make
secure investments and innovate
.
However,
for policies to make the impact needed to ramp BECCS up to the levels necessary to bring the UK to net zero, action is needed now
. The report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately, such as contracts for difference, or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters. For BECCS deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s, a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s.
Beyond just decarbonising the UK, a report by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
highlights that BECCS could be of even more importance globally. Differing scales of BECCS deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 1.5
o
C levels of pre-industrial levels, as per the Paris Climate agreement.
BECCS has the potential to play a vital role in power generation, creating a hydrogen economy and offsetting other emissions. As it continues to progress, it is becoming increasingly effective and cost efficient, offering a key component of a net zero UK.

From steel to soil – how industries are capturing carbon
11 March 2020
Carbon capture

Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) is a vital technology in the energy industry, with
facilities already in place
all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions.
However, for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2
o
C – as per the Paris Climate Agreement – emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy.
From cement factories to farmland, CCUS technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world.
Construction
The global population is increasingly urban and by
2050 it’s estimated 68% of all people will live in cities
. For cities to grow sustainably, it’s crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced.
Construction currently accounts for
11% of all global carbon emissions
. This includes emissions from the actual construction work, such as from vehicle exhaust pipes, but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials.
Steel and concrete are emissions-heavy to make; they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions. Deploying widespread CCUS in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment.
Steel manufacturing alone, regardless of the electricity used to power production, is responsible for about
7% of global emissions
. Projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in Europe and are already in motion in the United Arab Emirates.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Masdar, a renewable energy and sustainability company, formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercial-scale CCUS projects.
In its project with
Emirates Steel, which began in 2016, about 800,000 tonnes of CO
2
is captured
a year from the steel manufacturing plant. This is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The commercially self-sustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrial-scale projects in the region.
Cement manufacturing, a process that
produces as much as 8% of global greenhouse gases
, is also experiencing the growth of innovative CCUS projects.
Norcem Cement plant in Brevik, Norway has already begun experimenting with CCUS, calculating that it could capture
400,000 tonnes of CO
2
per year
and store it under the North Sea. If the project wins government approval, Norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023.
However, as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it, a team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is exploring a
new method of cement production that is more CCUS friendly
.
By pre-treating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process, the CO
2
produced is released in a pure, concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products, such as fizzy drinks.
Agriculture
It’s hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry. As well as feeding the world, it
employs a third of it
.
Within this sector, fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply. However, the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2% of global CO
2
emissions.
CCUS technology can reduce the CO
2
contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser, while maintaining crop reliability. In 2019, Oil and Gas Climate Initiative’s (OGCI) Climate Investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest CCUS project in the US.
Based at the
Wabash Valley Resources fertiliser plant in Indiana
, the project will capture between 1.3 and 1.6 million tonnes of CO
2
from the ammonia producer per year. The captured carbon will then be stored 2,000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer.
Similarly, since the turn of the millennium Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engineering has
deployed CCUS technology at fertiliser plants around Asia
. CO
2
is captured from natural gas pre-combustion, and used to create the urea fertiliser.
However, the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more nature-based and cheaper ways.
Soil
acts as a carbon sink, capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it. However, intensive ploughing can damage the soil’s ability to retain CO
2
.
It only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques, like minimising soil disturbance, or crop and grazing rotations, to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of CO
2
and even
make farms carbon negative
.
Transport
The transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions, according to the
World Health Organisation.
Electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sector’s decarbonisation, however, at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads. There are other essential modes of transport where CCUS has a role to play.

Climeworks, a Swiss company developing units that capture CO
2
directly from the air, has begun working with Rotterdam The Hague Airport to develop a direct air capture (DAC) unit on the airport’s grounds.

However, beyond just capturing CO
2
from planes taking off, Climeworks aims to
use the CO
2
to produce a synthetic jet fuel
– creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere. A pilot project aims to create 1,000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021.
Another approach to zero-carbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen, which is already powering
cars, trains, buses and even spacecraft
.
Hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways, but it’s predominantly created from natural gas, through a process in which CO
2
is a by-product.
CCUS can play an important role here in capturing the CO
2
and storing it
, preventing it entering the atmosphere.
The hydrogen-powered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat.
From every industry to every business to everyone
As CCUS technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable, it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites, to entire economic regions.
Global Thermostat
is developing DAC technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes. The system uses the waste heat to power a DAC unit, either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere. Such technologies along with those already in action like
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
, can quickly make
negative emissions a reality at scale
.
However, to capture, transport and permanently store CO
2
at the scale needed to reach net zero, collaboration partnerships and shared infrastructure between businesses in industrial regions is essential.
The UK’s Humber region is an example of an industrial cluster where a large number of high-carbon industrial sites sit in close proximity to one another. By
installing BECCS and CCUS infrastructure
that can be utilised by multiple industries, the UK can have a far greater impact on emissions levels than through individual, small-scale CCUS projects.
Decarbonising the UK and the world will not be achieved by individual sites and industries but by collective action that transcends sectors, regions and supply chains. Implementing CCUS at as large a scale as possible takes a greater stride towards bringing the wider economy and society to net zero.

5 projects proving carbon capture is a reality
4 March 2020
Carbon capture

The concept of capturing carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from power station, refinery and factory exhausts has long been hailed as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the UK and the rest of the world to
net zero
. After a number of false starts and policy hurdles, the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever. Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) is finally coming of age.
Increasing
innovation
and
investment
in the space is enabling the development of CCUS schemes at scale. Today, there are over 19 large-scale CCUS facilities in operation worldwide, while a further 32 in development as confidence in
government policies
and
investment frameworks
improves.
Once CO
2
is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers, in a process known as sequestration. It has also long been used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a process where captured CO
2
is injected into oil reservoirs to increase oil production
.
Drax Power Station is already trialling
Europe’s first
bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project. This combination of sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of CO
2
a year and put Drax Power Station at the centre of wider decarbonisation efforts across the region as part of
Zero Carbon Humber
.
Here are five other projects making carbon capture a reality today:
Snøhvit & Sleipner Vest

Who:
Sleipner – Equinor Energy, Var Energi, LOTOS, KUFPEC; Snøhvit – Equinor Energy, Petoro, Total, Neptune Energy, Wintershall Dean
Where:
Norway
Sleipner Vest offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant, Norway [Click to view/download]
Sleipner Vest
was the world’s first ever offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant, and has been active since 1996. The facility separates CO
2
from natural gas extracted from the Sleipner field, as well as from at the Utgard field, about 20km away. This method of carbon capture means CO
2
is removed before the natural gas is combusted, allowing it to be used as an energy source with lower carbon emissions.
Snøhvit
, located offshore in Norway’s northern Barents Sea, operates similarly but here natural gas is pumped to an onshore facility for carbon removal. The separated and compressed CO
2
from both facilities is then stored, or sequestered, in empty reservoirs under the sea.
The two projects demonstrate the safety and reality of long-term CO
2
sequestration – as of 2019, Sleipner has captured and stored over 23 million tonnes of CO
2
while Snøhvit stores 700,000 tonnes of CO
2
per year.
Petra Nova
Who:
NRG, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, Inc. (MHIA) and JX Nippon, a joint venture with Hilcorp Energy

Where:
Texas, USA
In 2016, the largest carbon capture facility in the world began operation at the
Petra Nova
coal-fired power plant.
Using a solvent developed by Mitsubishi and Kansai Electric Power, called
KS-1
, the CO
2
is absorbed and compressed from the exhausts of the plant after the coal has been combusted. The captured CO
2
is then transported and used for EOR 80 miles away on the West Ranch oil field.
Carbon capture facility at the Petra Nova coal-fired power plant, Texas, USA
As of January 2020, over 3.5 million tonnes of CO
2
had been captured, reducing the plant’s carbon emissions by 90%. Oil production, on the other hand, increased by 1,300% to 4,000 barrels a day. As well as preventing CO
2
from being released into the atmosphere, CCUS has also aided the site’s sustainability by eliminating the need for hydraulic drilling.
Gorgon LNG, Barrow Island, Australia [Click to view/download]
Gorgon LNG
Who:
Operated by Chevron, in a joint venture with Shell, Exxon Mobil, Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, Jera
Where:
Barrow Island, Australia
In 2019
CCS operations began
at one of Australia’s largest liquified natural gas production facilities, located off the Western coast. Here, CO
2
is removed from natural gas before the gas is cooled to -162
o
C, turning it into a liquid.
The
removed CO
2
is then injected via wells
into the Dupuy Formation, a saline aquifer 2km underneath Barrow Island.
Once fully operational (estimated to be in 2020), the project aims to reduce the facility’s emissions by about 40% and plans to store between 3.4 and 4 million tonnes of CO
2
each year.
Quest
Shell’s Quest carbon capture facility, Alberta, Canada
Who:
Operated by Shell, owned by Chevron and Canadian Natural Resources
Where:
Alberta, Canada
The Scotford Upgrader facility in Canada’s oil sands uses hydrogen to upgrade bitumen (a substance similar to asphalt) to make a synthetic crude oil.
In 2015, the
Quest
carbon capture facility was added to Scotford Upgrader to capture the CO
2
created as a result of making the site’s hydrogen. Once captured, the CO
2
is pressurised and turned into a liquid, which is piped and stored 60km away in the Basal Cambrian Sandstone saline aquifer.
Over its four years of crude oil production, four million tonnes of CO
2
have been captured. It is estimated that, over its 25-year life span, this CCS technology could capture and store over 27 million tonnes of CO
2
.
Chevron estimates that if the facility were to be built today, it would cost 20-30% less, a sign of the falling cost of the technology.
Boundary Dam
Who:
SaskPower
Where:
Saskatchewan, Canada
Boundary Dam
, a coal-fired power station, became the world’s first post-combustion CCS facility in 2014.
The technology uses
Shell’s Cansolv solvent
to remove CO
2
from the exhaust of one of the power station’s 115 MW units. Part of the captured CO
2
is used for EOR, while any unused CO
2
is stored in the Deadwood Formation, a brine and sandstone reservoir, deep underground.
As of December 2019, more than three million tonnes of CO
2
had been captured at Boundary Dam. The continuous improvement and optimisations made at the facility are proving CCS technology at scale and informing CCS projects around the world, including a possible retrofit project at SaskPower‘s 305 MW

What is net zero?
21 January 2020
Carbon capture

For age-old rivals Glasgow and Edinburgh, the race to the top has taken a sharp turn downwards. Instead, they’re in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first ‘net zero’ carbon city in the UK.
While they might be battling to be the
first
in the UK to reach net zero, they are far from the
only
cities with net zero in their sights. In the wake of the growing climate emergency, cities, companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting ‘net zero’.
It has become a global focus based on necessity – for the world to hit the Paris Agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees Celsius, it’s predicted the world must become
net zero by 2070
.
Yet despite its ubiquity, net zero is a term that’s not always fully understood. So, what does net zero actually mean?
Glasgow, Scotland. Host of COP26.
What does net zero mean?
‘Going net zero’ most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions. But this doesn’t just mean cutting all emissions down to zero.
Instead, net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted
[
*
]
and removed by a company, geographic area or facility is in balance.
In practice, this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions, an entity must capture, absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases. The result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes, so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere. Its carbon contributions are effectively zero – or more specifically, net zero.
The
Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment
likens the net zero target to running a bath – an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps (the mechanism
adding
emissions) or draining some of the water from the bathtub (the thing
removing
of emissions from the atmosphere). If these two things are equally matched, the water level in the bath doesn’t change.
To reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change, a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved.
But while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple, actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries, countries and governments.
How to achieve net zero
The UK’s
Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommends that to reach net zero
all industries must be widely decarbonised, heavy good vehicles must switch to low-carbon fuel sources, and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions, such as biomass production.
However, given the nature of many of these industries (and others considered ‘hard-to-treat’, such as aviation and manufacturing), completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible. Instead, residual emissions must be
counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions
.
Natural solutions can include afforestation (planting new forests) and reforestation (replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland), which use trees’ natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions.
On the other hand, engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before it’s released into the atmosphere. It is estimated this technology can
capture in excess of 90% of the carbon
released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production.

.
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere, often referred to as
negative
emissions.
BECCS
combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with CCUS. When that biomass comes from trees grown in
responsibly managed working forests
that absorb carbon, it becomes a low carbon fuel. When this process is combined with CCUS and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass’ use, the overall process removes more carbon than is released, creating ‘negative emissions’.
According to the
Global CCS Institute
, BECCS is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emission-heavy industries. A joint report by The Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Society estimates that
BECCS could help the UK to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050
– eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy.
The UK’s move to net zero
In June 2019, the UK became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It is one of a small group of countries, including France and Sweden, that have enacted this ambition into law, forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero.
Electrical radiator
Although this is an ambitious target, the UK is making steady progress towards it. In 2018 the UK’s emissions were 44% below 1990 levels, while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising – June 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an all-time low, falling below
100 g/kWh for the first time
. This is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid.
Hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions, however. An increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required. On the whole, the CCC predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by CCUS solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the UK’s net zero target.
This will need substantial financial backing. The CCC forecasts that, at present, a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 1-2% of GDP between now and 2050. However, there is still much debate about the role the
global carbon markets
need to play to facilitate a more cost-effective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms.
Industries across the UK are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target. In the energy sector, projects such as
Drax Power Station’s carbon capture pilots
are turning BECCS increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale.
Along with these individual projects, reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors. The
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership between energy companies, industrial emitters and local organisations, for example, aims to deliver the UK’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in the Humber region by the mid-2020s.
Nonetheless, efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the UK stays on course to meet all its immediate and long-term emissions targets. And regardless of whether or not Edinburgh or Glasgow realise their net zero goals first, the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and society’s drive for real change across the UK.
Drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 – removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations, creating a negative carbon footprint. Track our progress at
Towards Carbon Negative
.
[*] In this article we’ve simplified our explanation of net zero. Carbon dioxide (CO
2
) is the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG). It is also a long-lived GHG that creates warming that persists in the long term. Although the land and ocean absorb it, a significant proportion stays in the atmosphere for centuries or even millennia causing climate change. It is, therefore, the most important GHG to abate. Other long-lived GHGs include include nitrous oxide (N
2
O, lifetime of circa 120 years) and some F-Gasses (e.g. SF
6
with a lifetime of circa 3,200 years). GHGs are often aggregated as carbon dioxide equivalent (abbreviated as CO
2
e or CO
2
eq) and it is this that net zero targets measure. In this article, ‘carbon’ is used for simplicity and as a proxy for ‘carbon dioxide’, ‘CO
2
‘, ‘GHGs’ or ‘CO
2
e’.
