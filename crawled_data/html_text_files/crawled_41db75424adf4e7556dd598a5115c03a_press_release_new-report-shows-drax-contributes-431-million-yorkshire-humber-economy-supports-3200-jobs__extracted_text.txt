yorkshire and the humber economy and supports over 3200 jobs british energy business drax group contributed over 16 billion towards uk gdp in 2017 and supported thousands of jobs across the country including a contribution of 431 million in the yorkshire and humber region 12 november 2018 the findings were revealed in analysis by oxford economics looking at the economic impact of draxs uk operations which includes selbybased drax power station the power station which employs around 900 people and has converted four of its six generating units to use compressed wood pellets generated 15 of the countrys renewable electricity in 2017  enough for four million households researchers at oxford economics used three measures to calculate draxs gdp contribution the economic activity associated with the daytoday running of the business the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers and the wages the companys employees and suppliers employees spend in their local area in the past year drax power stations activities have supported employment in a wide range of sectors including highskilled manufacturing of industrial components engineering and technical machinery construction it professional business services and transport drax power ceo andy koss said andy koss this new report shows that as well as being of major significance nationally as the countrys biggest renewable power generator drax power station continues to play a crucial role in supporting the yorkshire economy thanks to a sophisticated supply chain that spans both the east and west coasts of the country drax supported over 5700 jobs across the north of england last year including 3200 in yorkshire and generated 600 million in economic activity drax works with hundreds of businesses across the northern powerhouse region to ensure millions of uk homes and businesses have the power they need each day the north of england has a rich heritage in providing energy to the rest of the uk drax continues to play a vital role in providing the country with flexible low carbon generation to support the system as it continues to decarbonise our strategy for moving beyond coal is enabling us to preserve the life of the power station protect jobs and ensure we continue to make an important contribution to the regions economy the conversion of a fourth generating unit at drax from coal to biomass helped the uk reach another green milestone this year as the power generating capacity available from renewables surpassed fossil fuels for the first time  it is also about to start the first bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot project of its kind in europe using technology developed by leeds university spinout company ccapture if successful the technology could enable the power produced at drax to become carbon negative meaning it helps reduce the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere negative emissions are vital if we are to meet our future climate targets nigel adams mp for selby and ainsty said drax is a key economic asset both in selby and nationwide as the countrys single largest generator of renewable electricity the business is a key part of the local community and supports employment and skills in the region drax has a rich history but has been keen to look to the future and further ways in which it can continue to innovate enriching our community osman ismail senior economist at oxford economics said drax group makes an important economic contribution to yorkshire and the humber and the uk more widely its activities generated

to complete at the end of the year subject to shareholder approval drax recently converted the fourth of its six generating units from coal to use sustainable biomass  around 70 of the power produced at the power station is now renewable it has plans to repower its two remaining coal generating units to use gas which are being considered by the planning inspectorate if approved drax could stop using coal well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks
