the kilometrelong tunnel that burrows into the dark rock of ben cruachan above the giant rumbling turbines sits something unusual for a power station a work of art the wood and goldleaf mural might seem at odds with the yellow metal turbines granite cavern walls and noise and heat around it but its closely connected to the power station and its ties to the surrounding landscape  the entrance tunnel might take engineers and machines to the heart of ben cruachan but the mural transports viewers to the mountains mythical past it tells the story of how this remarkable engineering achievement came to help power the country the narrative of the mural much like the machines and physical environment surrounding it the cruachan mural is big measuring 146 metres long by 36 metres tall combining wood plastic and gold leaf the relief is interspersed with celtic crosses textures evocative of granite rock and gold orbs that resemble the urban lights cruachan helps to power running from left to right it tells a linear narrative that spans the history of the mountain an artists impression of the mural in the visitor centre at cruachan in the first of the murals three segments is a scottish red deer a native species that still thrives in scotland today  below it is the figure of the cailleach bheur a legendary old woman or hag found across gaelic mythology in scotland ireland and on the isle of man the cailleach has a symbolic representation of a variety of roles in different folklores but she commonly appears as a personification of winter  and with that as a source of destruction in the context of ben cruachan cailleach bheur is often taken to mean the old hag of the ridges a figure who acts as the mythical guardian of a spring on the mountains peak the mural tells her story of how she was tasked to cover the well with a slab of stone at sundown and lift it away at sunrise one evening however she fell asleep and failed to cover the well allowing it to overflow and cause water to cascade down the mountain flooding the valley below and drowning the people and their cattle the mural within the turbine hall at cruachan power station undergoing maintenance november 2018 this serves as the legendary origins of loch awe from which cruachan power station pumps water to the upper reservoir when theres excess electricity on the grid the story claims the water washed a path through to the sea creating the pass of brander the site of a 1308 battle in the scottish wars of independence where robert the bruce defeated the englishaligned macdougall and macnaghten clans the mythical first section of the mural is separated by a celticstyle cross from the modern second segment which portrays the power stations construction within ben cruachan  here four figures represent the four lead engineers of the project from the firms james williamson  partners william tawse ltd edmund nuttall ltd and merz  mclellan  they stand by the mountain a roughly cut path running through its core at the base of the mural are the faces of 15 men lying on their sides these are the 15 who were killed in 1962 when the ceiling of the turbine hall caved in during construction  their uniform expressionless faces however turn them into symbols of the 30plus workers who died while digging and blasting the power stations tunnels and constructing the dam at the upper reservoir next to this is a fairy tale portrayal of queen elizabeth ii who wears a gold grown and holds a sceptre from which electricity flows in a glowing lightning bolt through rock commanding the power station into life the final third of the mural shows the whole power station system within the mountain the upper reservoir sits nestled in the slopes of ben cruachan with water flowing down the mountain to the four turbines and loch awe below viewed as a whole the mural takes the audience from mythology to the modern power station which continues to play a vital role in the electricity system today carving the cruachan mural the mural was created by artist elizabeth falconer who was commissioned to create it to celebrate the power stations opening by the queen on 15 october 1965 at the time only two of cruachans four 100 megawatt mw reversible turbines were completed and operational but it was still the first station of its kind to operate at such a scale two of the power stations turbines were modified with increased capacities meaning cruachan can both use and generate up to 440 mw  hrh queen elizabeth ii opening cruachan on 15 october 1965 the project came to falconer through her husband a native of aberdeen who worked as an architect partner to one of cruachans engineering firms the brief simply requested she create a piece to fill the empty space on the wall of the turbine hall deciding to dive into the history and mythology of the mountain she initially carved the mural in london and only ventured into hollow mountain years after it was first put in place to make renovations on the work cruachan power station was a visionary idea and represented a considerable technical and engineering achievement when it opened the designs and construction of the reversable turbines put this site at the cutting end of modern energy technology so its fitting the mural appears distinctly modern in its design yet tells a story that connects this modern power station to the ancient rock it lives within its cruachans murals location inside the mountain that makes it so unique as a work of art however at a time when the electricity grid is changing to an increasingly renewable system based more around weather and geography the connections the mural makes between scotlands landscape and the modern power station make it relevant beyond the turbine

 drax power station  energy storage  galloway hydro scheme  gas  investors  lanark hydro scheme why spin a turbine without generating power 12 february 2020 power generation massive spinning machinery is a big part of electricity generation whether its a wind turbine hydro plant or biomass generator but big spinning turbines dont just pump electricity out onto the grid they also play a crucial role in keeping the electricity system stable safe and efficient this is because big heavy spinning turbines add something else to the grid inertia  this is defined as an objects resistance to change but in the context of electricity it helps the grid remain at the right frequency and voltage level in short they help the grid remain stable however as electricity systems in great britain and other parts of the world move away from coal and gas to renewables such as wind turbines solar panels and interconnectors the level of inertia on the system is falling we need the inertia we dont need the megawatts explains julian leslie head of networks at the national grid electricity system operator eso but in todays market we have to supply the megawatts and receive the inertia as a consequence engineer inspecting turbine blades at drax power station the national grid eso is taking a new approach to this aspect of grid stability by using what are called synchronous condensers these complicatedsounding pieces of machinery are actually quite straightforward in their concept they provide inertia to the grid without generating unnecessary power these come in the form of existing generators that remain connected to the grid but refrain from producing electricity purpose built machines whose only function is to act as synchronous condensers never generating real power these may be fitted with flywheels to increase their mass and in consequence their inertia this means that spinning without generating is about to become a very important part of great britains electricity system around and around electricity generators that spin at 3000 rpm are described as synchronous generators because they are in sync with the grids frequency of 50hz these include coal gas hydro biomass turbines and nuclear units most spin at 3000 rpm some machines much less eg 750 rpm thanks to the way they are designed they are all synchronised together at the same higher speed then there are wind turbines where the generated power is not synchronised to the grid system termed asynchronous generators these machines do not have readily accessible stored energy inertia and do not contribute to the stability of the system interconnectors and solar panels are also asynchronous its important that great britains whole grid is kept within 1 of the 50hz frequency  otherwise the voltage of electricity starts to fluctuate damaging equipment becoming less efficient even dangerous or resulting in blackouts say a power station or a wind farm were to drop offline as occurred in august 2019  this would cause the amount of power on the grid to suddenly fall but it is not just the power that changes  the frequency and voltage also fluctuate dramatically which can cause equipment damage and ultimately towns cities or widespread areas to lose power running machines that have inertia act like the suspension on a car  they dampen those fluctuations so they are not as drastic the big spinning machines keep spinning buying valuable milliseconds for the grid to react often automatically before the damage becomes widespread however as a consequence of decarbonisation more solar panels and wind turbines are now on the system and there are fewer spinning turbines leading to lower levels of inertia on the grid there are periods when renewable generation and flow from interconnectors are so great that it displaces all conventional rotational power plants says leslie today bringing more inertia onto the grid may mean switching off renewables or interconnectors and then replacing them with rotating plants and the megawatts associated with that creating a market for inertia and synchronous condensers offers a new way forward  providing inertia without unneeded megawatts or emissions from fossil fuels a new spin on grid stability at the start of 2020 the national grid eso began contracting parties including draxs cruachan pumpedhydro power station  to operate synchronous condensers and provide inertia to the grid when needed the plans mark a departure from the previous system where inertia and voltage control from electricity generators was taken for granted cruachan power station is already capable of running its units in synchronous condenser mode one of its units opened up for maintenance is pictured at the top of this article this involves an alternator acting as a motor offering inertia to the grid without generating unneeded electricity other service providers will repurpose existing turbines construct new machines or develop new technologies that can electronically respond to the grids need for stability synchronous condensers or the idea of spinning a turbine freely without generating power are not new concepts power stations in the second half of the 20 th century could shut down certain generating units but keep them spinning online for voltage control in the 1960s and 70s some substations  where the voltage of electricity is stepped up and down from the transmission system  also deployed standalone synchronous condensers these were also used to provided inertia as well as voltage control but are long since decommissioned synchronous condenser installation at templestowe substation melbourne victoria australia by mriya via wikimedia  synchronous condensers are a proven technology that have been used in the past says leslie and there are many new technologies we are now exploring that can deliver a similar service cheaper cleaner more stable the national grid eso estimates the technology will save electricity consumers up to 128 million over the next six years savings which come from negating the need for the grid to call upon fossil fuels for inertia as coal oil and gas become increasingly uneconomical across the globe as carbon taxes grow the fact that synchronous condensers do not produce electricity also saves money the grid may have had to pay out to renewable generators to stop them producing electricity or to storage systems to absorb excess power it means the market can deliver the renewable flow without the grid having to pay to restrain it or to pay for gas to stabilise the system says leslie not only does this allow more renewable generation but it also reduces the cost to the consumer in a future energy system where there is an abundance of renewable electricity generations synchronous condensers will be crucial in keeping the grid stable the national grid esos investment in the technology further highlights the importance of new ideas and innovation to balance the grid through this energy transition  synchronous generation provides benefits to system stability beyond the provision of inertia in a subsequent article well also explore how synchronous condensers can assist with voltage stability and help regional electricity networks and customers to remain connected to the national system during and after faults read about the past present and

january 2020 power generation scotlands landscape is defined by its weather the millennia of wind rain and snow has battered the country ebbing away at its rivers mountains valleys and deep lochs forged by ice ages and volcanos weather also plays an important role in the countrys power generation the country has more than 9 gigawatts gw of installed wind power  enough to sometimes meet double scotlands electricity demand  as well as having a long history of hydropower but while it is an intrinsic part of the country scotlands weather can be anything but pleasant rain can be persistent and when the temperature drops in winter it turns to snow  a lot of it scotland gets more snow than any other part of the uk scottish poet robert burns described the harshness of the winter months in his 1781 poem winter a dirge the wintry west extends his blast and hail and rain does blaw or the stormy north sends driving forth the blinding sleet and snaw sleet and snaw snow fall occurs on average for 38 days a year in scotland compared to an average of 23 days across the rest of the united kingdom and can remain covering mountaintops long into spring ben cruachan the peak of ben cruachan in the western highlands is no exception cruachan power station  on the slopes of the mountain however must be ready to either generate or absorb electricity through all forms of weather  even the most severe on a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that weve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time says gordon pirie a civil engineer at cruachan thankfully we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely mountain road from cruachan power station to its dam blocked due to snow this mountainside location and winter weather can make for tough working conditions but cruachan is designed to handle it in fact in some cases it benefits from it taking advantage of wet weather cruachan is built around the geography and climate of the highlands it stores water in an upper reservoir 400 meters 1312 feet up ben cruachan and uses its elevation to run it down the mountain spin a turbine and generate power and when there is excess electricity being generated nationally the same turbines reverse and use the excess electricity to pump water from loch awe up to the reservoir helping to balance the grid this acts as a form of energy storage by essentially stockpiling the excess electricity in the form of water held in the top reservoir for the most part the water used to generate electricity comes exclusively from loch awe and is passed up and down the mountain however 10 of it comes for free as its collected from natural rainfall and surface water that makes its way to the upper reservoir through cruachans aqueducts this system of 14 kilometres of interconnected concrete pipes covers a 23 square kilometre radius around the reservoir and is designed to bring in water from 75 intakes dotted around the top of the mountain a north of scotland hydroelectric board diagram from c1960s showing the aqueducts feeding cruachans dam click to viewdownload some of these intakes are as small as street drains while others are large enough to drive a land rover into its part of piries job to keep them in good working order so they continue to deliver water to the reservoir as the intakes are scattered around the mountaintop they must be able to deal with whatever the scottish winter throws at them gordon pirie civil engineer and cruachan power station dam even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system the intakes have a builtin feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid explains pirie any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir as spring arrives and snow begins to thaw across the highlands greater volumes of water will run off into the reservoir and the power stations engineers work to manage the water level keeping water pressure under control thawing snow can bring greater volumes of water into the reservoir the power station must be able to pump water and absorb excess electricity from the grid at a moments notice this ability to turn excess electricity into stored energy makes cruachan hugely useful in controlling the grids voltage frequency and in keeping it stable  however there must be enough space available in the reservoir for the water being pumped up the mountainside to enter  even when excessive rainfall or melting snow begins to naturally fill it up the power station can control the reservoir levels through a number of means this includes the ability to close off an aqueduct or to run the turbines without generating electricity so the team can move water from the reservoir into loch awe below if the water level and pressure on the dam reaches dangerous levels a dispenser valve can be opened in an emergency sending a jet of water flying out the dam to cascade safely down the mountainside however outside of testing this has never been necessary to do and while the weather might be the most persistent natural force the power station must deal with its not the only one recently we had an issue with a bat roosting within one of the tunnels in which we were carrying out stabilisation works recalls pirie it was looking for a suitable location to hibernate for the winter and the tunnel provided the ideal environment we had to stop works to have a bat survey undertaken and apply for a bat license cruachans location makes for stunning views of the highlands but occasionally brutally cold and perilously wet conditions come with the territory for the power station team working with the sometimesdespairing weather is all part

technology the men who built a power station inside a mountain 12 november 2019 power generation travelling through the highlands towards the west coast of scotland you pass the mighty ben cruachan  its 1126 metre peak towers over the winding loch awe beneath it is the natural world on a huge scale but within its granite core sits a manmade engineering wonder cruachan power station  opened by the queen in 1965 it is one of only four pumpedhydro stations in the uk and today remains just as impressive an engineering feat as when it was first opened cruachan is operated safely and hasnt had a lost time injury in 15 years the robust health and safety policies and practices employed at the power station were not in place all those decades ago it took six years to construct enlisting a 4000strong workforce who drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain eventually removing some 220000 cubic metres of rubble the work was physically exhausting  the environment dark and dangerous nicknamed the tunnel tigers the men that carried the work out came from far and wide attracted to its ambition as well as a generous pay packet reflective of the danger and difficulty of the work but few of them were fully prepared for the extent of the challenge one labourer who started at cruachan just after his 18 th birthday recalls i was in for a shock when i went down there the heat the smoke  you couldnt see your hands in front of you inside the mountain the work of hollowing out ben cruachan was realised by handdrilling twotothree metre deep holes into the granite rockface an explosive known as gelignite which can be moulded by hand was packed into the drilled holes and detonated the blasted rocks were removed by bulldozers trucks and shovels before drilling began on the fresh section of exposed granite in total 20km of tunnels and chambers were excavated this way including the kilometrelong entrance tunnel and the 91metrelong 36metrehigh machine hall wilson scott was just 18 when he got a job working as a labourer at cruachan while the machine hall was being cleared out the gelignite it had a smell right away i was told not to put it near your face he says itll give you a splitting headache and your eyes will close with the fumes that come off it it was scary stuff this process allowed for rapid expansion through the mountain with three or four blasts each 12hour shift some 20 metres of rock could be cleared in the course of a day activity was constant and to save the men having to make the journey back up to the surface refreshments came to them there was a bus that went down the tunnel at 11 oclock with a huge urn of terrible tea says scott most of the windows were out of the bus because the pressure of the blasting had blown them in the tea did little to make the environment hospitable however from the water dripping through the porous rocks making floors slippery and exposed electrics vulnerable to the massive machinery rushing through the dense dust and smoke danger was everpresent loose rocks as large as cars would often fall from exposed walls and ceilings while the regular blasting gave the impression the entire mountain was shaking ill tell you something going into that tunnel the first time scott says it was a fascinating place but quite a scary place too above them on top of the mountain a similarly intrepid team tackled a different challenge building the 316metrelong dam they may have escaped the hot and humid conditions at the centre of cruachan but their task was no less daunting cruachan dam construction early 1960s on top of the dam out in the open 400 metres above loch awe the team were exposed to the harsh scottish elements john william ross came to cruachan at the age of 35 to work as a driver and spent time working in the open air of the dam youd get oil skins and welly boots and that was it we didnt have gloves if your hands froze  well thats tough luck isnt it mr ross sadly passed away recently charlie campbell a 19yearold shutter joiner who worked on the dam found an innovative way around the cold youd put on your socks and then youd get womens tights and youd put them over the top of the socks and then youd put your wellies on and thatd keep your feet a wee bit warmer we thought it did anyway maybe it was just the thought of the womens stockings pouring the concrete of the dam  almost 50 metres high at its tallest point  was precarious work especially given the challenges of working with materials like concrete and bentonite a slurrylike liquid used in construction it was horrible stuff it was like diarrhoea thats the only way of explaining it says campbell there was a boy  toastie  i cant remember his real name he fell into it they had quite a job getting him out they thought he was drowned but he was alright many others were not alright the danger of the work and conditions both inside and on top of the mountain meant there was a significant human cost for the project during construction 15 people tragically lost their lives today a carved wooden mural hangs on the wall of the machine hall to capture and commemorate the myth of the mountain and the men who sadly died  a constant reminder of the bravery and sacrifice they made the men that made the mountain the cruachan tunnel tigers the tunnel tigers were united in their efforts but came from a range of backgrounds and cultures polish and irish labourers worked alongside scots as well as displaced europeans prisoners of the second world war and even workers from as far as asia the men would work 12 sometimes 18hour shifts seven days a week campbell adds that some men opted to continue earning rather than rest by doing a ghoster which saw them working a solid 36 hours many men would make treble the salary of their previous jobs with some receiving as much as 100 a week at a time when the average pay in scotland was 12 some teams payslips were stamped with the words danger money  illustrative of the mens motivation to endure such lifethreatening work while it was a dangerous and demanding job many of the tigers look back with fond memories of their time on the site and many stayed in the area for years after it was an experience im glad i had says scott it puts you in good stead for the rest of your days as for cruachan power station its four turbines are still relied on today by great britain to balance everyday energy supply as the electricity system continues to change the pumped hydro stations dual ability to deliver 440 megawatts mw of electricity in just 30 seconds or absorb excess power from the grid by pumping water from loch awe to its upper reservoir is even more important than when it opened cruachan machine hall roof

from coal to pumped hydro storage in 83 mountainous miles 7 october 2019 power generation nestled in in the western highlands in scotland cruachan power station is surrounded by a breathtaking landscape of plunging mountainsides and curving lochs between which weave narrow roads it makes for scenic driving what might be trickier however is transporting 230 tonnes of electrical equipment up and down said mountains navigating narrow bends but thats exactly what a team from drax was tasked with when it came to moving two 115 tonne transformers the equipment used to boost electricitys voltage they were in storage 83 miles away at longannet currently being demolished near fife youre moving a piece of equipment that is designed to stay in one place its not designed to go on the roads explains jamie beardsall an electrical engineer from the eci engineering team who worked on the project youre very aware of your environment and the risks everything is checked and doubled checked transformers being driven to draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station the complicated task required colleagues from both cruachan and drax power stations to collaborate from the very beginning gary brown mark rowbottom and jamie from the eci engineering team based in yorkshire teamed up with gordon pirie and roddy davies from scotland who met frequently and planned the project alongside specialist transport contractor ale which advised on heavy lifting and movement planning and execution of the works also required constant liaison and coordination with the police and highway authorities in both scotland and england but more than that the transformers onebyone journey from the demolition site of what was once europes biggest coalfired power station  to a hydropowered energy storage site on the other side of scotland represents the continual shift of great britains electricity away from fossil fuels stepping up voltage transformers are an essential part of the electricity system by increasing or decreasing the voltage of an electrical current they can enable it to traverse the national grid or make electricity safe to enter our homes when we generate electricity it is at a lower voltage than we need to send it out to the national grid says beardsall we use transformers to increase the voltage so it can go out to the national grid and be transmitted over long distances more efficiently we then reduce the voltage again so it can be brought safely into our homes while all transformers apply the same principles for stepping voltage up and down  the two transformers that were transported through the highlands to cruachan were designed specifically for the pumped storage hydro power station but stored at longannet where there was more space at the time both stations where owned by scottish power cruachan was purchased by drax on the last day of 2018 engineers at cruachan power station in front of one of the original transformers when transported each transformer weighs 115 tonnes and is almost four metres high transporting them isnt as simple as loading them into the back of a van you cant transport them in a fully built state they would be too heavy and wouldnt go under bridges says beardsall we had to strip them back to the core and now were working to reassemble them on site cutting down to the core each transformer consists of two main components a core made of iron and two windings made of copper the transformer itself has no moving parts when a voltage is applied to one of the transformer windings the primary winding a magnetic field is created in the iron core this field then induces a voltage into the other winding the secondary winding depending on the number of coils on each set of windings the output voltage will increase or decrease more coils on the secondary winding steps the voltage up fewer coils on the secondary steps the voltage down this entire apparatus is submerged in an oil to provide insulation and keep the transformer cool meaning the first step was to drain 50000 litres of oil from each transformer this was then sent to a refinery to be processed cleaned and stored until the transformers are reassembled at cruachan oil removed the drax engineers oversaw and managed the dismantling of the transformers at longannet once the transformers were stripped down to a state suitable for movement they were loaded up onebyone for transportation meanwhile at cruachan engineers worked on construction of a purpose built bunded area for storage of the transformers the transformers were destined to be stored on land outside the main admin buildings adjacent to loch awe loch awe at cruachan power station the loch itself is a beautiful place with abundant animal and birdlife  and a fish farm is located almost directly opposite the power station in the event of a transformer leaking the natural environment must be protected an oiltight storage area was therefore built to ensure that no oil would end up in the loch the road to cruachan rather than heaving each of the transformers onto a trailer each one was raised using hydraulic jacking equipment a trailer was then driven underneath and the transformer lowered onto it the trailer is specifically designed to take the transformers and fit certain dimensions explains beardsall it has 96 wheels over 12 sets of axles each of which can be turned individually to assist in navigating around tight spots the trailers are towed by large tractor units each weighing over 40 tonnes these provided the motive power to move the transformers each was moved in two stages over the space of two weeks the first transformer over the course of a weekend the second in the middle of the night some 10 days later when we could go was governed by the police and highways agencies as they need to close the roads says beardsall we set off from longannet at 7pm on the friday evening and moved them 60 miles along the route to a layby where we stored them that leg took approximately five hours then the second leg was the last 25 miles to cruachan carried out on the sunday morning of the same weekend navigating the highlands with 115 tonnes of hugely valuable equipment is where the real challenge came in hills dips and tight turns made for slow progress the original generator transformer at cruachan power station the average speed was about 10mph but were going through the highlands so it was quite a bit slower than that in some places we occasionally hit 20 mph at points but that was definitely for the minority of the time says beardsall some of the roads were so narrow it was difficult to get two cars past each other the contractors also had to put metal plating over bridges because they werent strong enough to take the load having safely arrived at cruachan the transformers are being stored at surface level until they are needed at which time they will be taken down the halfamilelong tunnel into the energy storage station typically a transformer has a design life of 25 years although they can last longer explains beardsall there are four units at cruachan and the transformers for two of these units have already been replaced so these transformers would be used to replace the existing transformer for the two remaining units should it ever be needed the existing transformer having been in operation since 1965  moving heavy objects is part and parcel of running draxs multiple power stations around the country however navigating the highlands the very terrain which makes cruachan possible  added a unique challenge for draxs engineers visit cruachan power station  the hollow mountain read the press release tags cruachan power station  engineering  technology  transport in energy storage timing is everything 21 august 2019 power generation electricity is unlike any other resource the amount being generated must exactly match demand for it around the clock managing this delicate balancing act is the job of the national grid electricity system operator eso which works constantly to ensure supply meets demand and the grid remains balanced  one of the ways it does this is by storing energy when there is too much and deploying it when there is too little although there are many different ways of storing energy at a small scale at grid level it becomes more difficult one of the few ways it is currently possible is through pumped hydro storage cruachan power station in the highlands of scotland is one of four pumped storage facilities in great britain it uses electricallydriven turbines to pump water up a mountain into a reservoir when there is excess electricity on the grid and then releases the water stored in the reservoir back down to spin the same turbines to generate power when its needed quickly the dual capabilities of these turbines are unique to pumped hydro storage and contribute to the overall grids stability however what dictates when cruachans turbines switch from pump to generate and vice versa is all a matter of what the grid needs  and when the switch from pump to generate while the machine hall of cruachan power station is an aweinspiring place for its size and location 396 metres beneath ben cruachan it generates electricity much like any other hydropower station harnessing the flow of water to rotate any number of its four 100 megawatt mw turbines this mode  simply called generate mode  is usually employed during periods of peak power demand such as mornings and evenings during a major national televised event  or when wind and solar energy output drops below forecast as a result starting up and generating millions of watts of electricity has to be fast it takes just two minutes for a turbine to run up from rest to generate mode says martin mcghie operations and maintenance manager at the power station it takes slightly longer for the turbines to run down from generate to rest but whatever function the turbines are performing they can reach it within a matter of minutes the reverse of generate mode is pump mode which changes the direction of travel for the water this time using electricity from the grid to pump water from the vast loch awe at the foot of ben cruachan to the upper reservoir where it waits ready to be released in contrast to generate mode pump mode typically comes into play at times when demand is low and there is too much power on the system such as during nights or at weekends when there is excessive wind generation  however the grid has evolved since cruachan first began generating in 1965 and this has changed when it and how it operates in the early days cruachan was used in a rather predictable way pumping overnight to absorb excess generation from coal and nuclear plants and generating during daytime peak periods says martin the move to more renewable energy sources like wind mean overall power generation is more unpredictable he continues there has also been a move from cruachan being primarily an energy storage plant to one which can also offer a range of ancillary services to the grid system operator the benefits of spin mode in between pumping water and generating power cruachans turbines can also spin in air while connected to the grid neither pumping not generating this is essentially a standby mode where the turbines are ready to either quickly switch into generation or pumping at a moments notice they spin one way for spin pump the other for spin generate these spin modes are requested by the eso to ensure reserve energy is available to respond rapidly to changes on the grid system in spin generate mode the generator is connected up to the grid but the water is ejected from the space around the turbine by injecting compressed air the turbine does not generate power but is kept spinning allowing it to quickly start up again as soon as the grid has an urgent need for power the air is released and the water from the upper reservoir flows into the turbine to begin generation in under 30 seconds spin pump works on the same basis as spin generate but with the turbine rotating in the opposite direction ready to pump at short notice this allows cruachan to absorb excess generation and balance the system as soon as the eso needs it the use of spin mode by the eso is highly variable and dependant on a number of factors eg weather conditions or the state of the grid system at the time says martin this unpredictability of the increasingly intermittent electricity system makes the flexibility of cruachans multiple turbines all the more important ready for the future grid its not only the types of electricity generation around the system that are changing how cruachan operates martin suggests that the way energy traders and the eso use cruachan will continue to evolve as the market requirements and opportunities change technology is also changing the market and martin predicts this could affect what cruachan does in the future we will face competition from alternative storage technologies such as batteries electric vehicles  as well as competition for the other ancillary services we offer however cruachans flexibility to generate absorb or spin in readiness means it is prepared to adjust to any future changes cruachan is always ready to modify or upgrade to meet requirements as we have done in the past says martin the priority is always to be able to deliver the services required by the grid system operator  in characteristic quick time visit

grid  technology what makes a mountain right for energy storage 22 may 2019 power generation electricity generation is often tied to a countrys geography climate and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots
