taming the electric beast to keep a site as big and complex as drax power station running you need to be ready to mend a few faults thats where gareth newton comes in 22 january 2017 power generation its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance says gareth newton as a mechanical engineer in one of the power stations maintenance teams hes a man with a closer eye on that animal than most and when something does need fixing or improving its his job to make sure it happens its a task that keeps him busy on top of the teams ive got a team servicing the filter fans ive got a team doing a filter change on a biomass unit then ive got another company doing a pipework replacement on a discharge line for me somebody else is doing a service on the belt cleaners newton says listing half a typical days responsibilities on any given day he oversees a number of different teams that carry out a variety of maintenance tasks and more often than not that list is a long one hes a part of the materials handling team who deal with all the material arriving and leaving the power station this includes the biomass and coal fuel coming in and the ash gypsum and other byproducts from the generation process going out it means he has a hand in the maintenance of almost all parts of the plant from the compressed wood pellet storage domes to the boiler with such a broad perspective of such a complex plant he knows its not always the things you expect to fail that need fixing monitoring the machine its a machine  its being used its not a showpiece or something in a museum its real and every now and then it will throw a gear out and stop he says those failures dont always happen to a schedule  so when something does go wrong it can be unexpected you might have a 50000 gearbox sat in the stores ready and waiting to replace a faulty one but it will be the 10 probe on a conveyer belt you never thought would break that fails and holds the whole system up he says when something like that happens he adds its not always about having the exact tool that can fix it right there and then its about thinking out of the box the biggest part of this job and i think its one of the biggest parts of heavy industry engineering is not fixing or modifying things with what youve got he says its about using what you havent got to try and engineer your way out he continues if you havent got a tool or part that you need can you make something new can you find a way to make it work or do you even need it its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance keeping your hands dirty newton grew up around engineering his father ran a salvage yard and precious metals business and would bring back broken bits of machinery for the kids to fix as toys ive always had dirty hands he says its something thats stuck with him today even though he now spends a large proportion of his time monitoring jobs at a computer or moving between teams its the practical side of the job that keeps him interested the best part of the job is working with your hands and even though the demands of the living animal that is drax can sometimes keep him on site longer than his working hours its a beast hes happy to look after its a job you either love or hate if you didnt enjoy the engineering side you probably wouldnt like it because theres a lot of ingenuity and thinking on your feet needed he says but there are a lot of jobs out there that i wouldnt want share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy
