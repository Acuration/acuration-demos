power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station the shape of electricity use in 2018 great britains power is cleaner and more efficient than ever but will it last 31 january 2018 power generation in homes and offices on streets and in shops there are more electronic devices than ever however for all the phones washing machines and tvs british consumers are plugging in our electricity consumption has been on a downward tick  and has been since the middle of the last decade  at the same time an increasing percentage of our demand is being met by renewable and lowcarbon energy sources by 2016 greenhouse gas emissions from electricity had dropped to 62 below 1990 levels  helping the uk get close to meeting its third carbon budget target its the power sector that has seen the biggest reductions through the decline of coal the greater use of gas and the rise of renewables there are still big strides to make in the economy as a whole  particularly in sectors such as heat transport and buildings but there are positive signs of transformation that could help the country reach its fifth carbon budget goal of lowering emissions by 57 between 1990 and 2030 will 2018 prove to be another milestone year for great britains electricity system and could the electrification of the economy help other sectors stepup their own decarbonisation the efficiency transformation reduced demand for electricity comes in part as a result of the decline in energyintensive manufacturing and heavy industry however in the domestic sector the decline has been equally significant since 2002 energy consumption in the home has fallen 19 from 52229 ktoe kilotonne of oil equivalent to 42486 ktoe as well as electricity this includes gas solid fuels such as coal and more this drop comes despite a growing population economic growth an increase in the number of households and a rising number of consumer devices and appliances  so what exactly is bringing down energy consumption one cause is the increased efficiency of electronics and appliances the phasing out of incandescent lightbulbs  which had hardly changed since edisons day  in favour of energysaving models such as leds has reduced electricity used to light homes by a third since 1997 as well as the improved efficiency of large appliances like fridge freezers there is also a greater consumer awareness of electricity saving habits such as washing clothes at lower temperatures the increase in small batterypowered devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops on the other hand means were spending less time using higherpowered equipment that constantly pulls from the grid such as tvs and hifis what this can lead to however is a change in the shape of electricity demand the shape of power demand can be explored in electric insights  for example overnight when many people choose to charge those batterypowered appliances such changes in demand present a challenge to forecasters at in national grids control room who predict ahead when where and how much power will be needed from the countrys electricity grid shifting demand spikes todays peak electricity demand times remain relatively unchanged from the 20 th century people still come home and turn on lights kettles and washing machines at around 5pm and 6pm but as artificial intelligence makes its way into more and more home appliances  these spikes are likely to level out across the day connected devices will aim to predict peak times and where such tariffs are provided by energy suppliers only run when overall demand costs are lower at the same time lifestyles have changed affecting electricity demand even further in the past some of the biggest surges in uk electrical history came in the immediate aftermath of big tv moments when people across the country switched on kettles opened fridges and went to the toilet now the proliferation of ondemand and online tv has reduced the need for national grid to keep power stations on standby during major televised moments as people choose to watch at their leisure rather than when they are broadcast sports however remains one of the things that still attracts large numbers of live viewers this junes football world cup means the national grid will be braced for any surges in postpenalty shootout tea breaks combined with a royal wedding  the last of which caused a significant spike  summer 2018 could see a few rare moments when mass tv viewing shunts electricity demand enough for it to be noticeable cleaner power but while 2018 may see some instances where demand surges its likely power generation will continue to grow cleaner the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis has released projections suggesting installed renewable electricity capacity could reach 36 gigawatts gw by 2030  building on a 900 increase between 2007 and 2017 it is of course important we continue to use electricity more efficiently in 15 years from now its predicted that power generation could begin to rise significantly and so decarbonising the production of power is arguably just as important as saving it this year will see another flexible 600 megawatt mw coal unit converted to sustainable biomass at drax power station in yorkshire and the first of 84 offshore wind turbines turned on as part of the 588mw beatrice project in the outer moray firth these developments will quicken the pace of decarbonisation in great britains electricity network meaning that positive trend that will continue this is the second story in a series on
