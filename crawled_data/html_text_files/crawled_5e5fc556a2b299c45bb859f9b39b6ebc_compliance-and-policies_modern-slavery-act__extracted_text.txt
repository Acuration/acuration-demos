subcommittee of our executive committee oversees our programme it provides an annual report on its decisions and activity to our audit committee which comprises executive and nonexecutive directors the ebcc has approved a protocol and remediation plan based on guidance from the home office that we must follow if we discover modern slavery in our business or supply chain is responsible for making sure drax takes appropriate steps to investigate and remediate the risk of modern slavery both within our own business and our supply chain no cases of modern slavery have been escalated to the ebcc to date we continue to work with our colleagues and suppliers to raise awareness and promote transparency in our supply chains progress in 2020 the ebcc in addition to the executive committee and board approved a new drax code of conduct drax code and supplier code of conduct supplier code the mswg continued its work to deliver draxs ongoing improvement programme as reported throughout this statement the ebcc approved a detailed remediation plan to be used should modern slavery be discovered in draxs supply chain draxs employee forums were engaged to establish the effectiveness of draxs antimodern slavery programme the mswg continued its work to deliver draxs ongoing improvement programme as reported throughout this statement in 2021 we plan to increase the frequency of our communication on the topic of modern slavery following feedback from our employee forums research suitable incountry non governmental organisations ngos and or other partners to support drax should an issue occur that requires the ebcc approved remediation plan to be put into action risk assessment were committed to identifying and addressing modern slavery that could be connected to both our business and supply chain due to the controls and practices weve adopted as described in the employment practices section below we believe the risk of modern slavery in our own business is very low our wider supply chain is varied and complex meaning the risk of modern slavery is higher we have almost 4000 suppliers across our procurement activities and engage with many different industries including forestry manufacturing freight and logistics engineering construction it and site services the global slavery index which is incorporated into our due diligence platform continues to contribute to the risk assessment of potential suppliers if the assessment returns a medium or higher risk result then we issue a supplementary questionnaire for completion this includes questions on underage workers employee rights and freedoms use of foreign and migrant workers due diligence processes policies and procedures in 2020 we started collaborating with supply chain sustainability experts elevate our work leverages elevates supply chain intelligence platform and datasets and geographic commodity and biomass research identifying local industry risk trends in this way helps to inform our risk mitigation activities supply chain mapping the following graphic provides statistics on our 2020 fuel supply procurement activity of those countries listed we consider latvia estonia lithuania russia ukraine and belarus sub tier 1 to be higher risk for modern slavery we carry out additional due diligence on these supply chains as described above coal procurement drax will end commercial coal generation at drax power station by march 2021 to this end we didnt receive any international coal in 2020 and had only two deliveries of domestic coal scotland totaling 3kt nonfuel supply the following graphic provides statistics on our 2020 nonfuel procurement activity by percentage of spend and geography on our tier 1 supply it shows that 92 of our spend is with tier 1 suppliers based in the uk in 2020 our procurement team as part of our supplier category management processes continued a project to map our nonfuel supply chain the team carried out an initial trial on our metering category for our second generation of smart meters using the elevate platform to support the risk assessment process well continue this work across our top categories of nonfuel spend in 2021 in the meantime our policy is to carry out riskbased due diligence on all suppliers before entering a contract we also endeavour to include obligations within these agreements for suppliers to cascade our standards to subcontractors weve started to introduce our new supplier code into our onboarding and contracting processes progress in 2020 completed an annual risk assessment in line with home office guidance and reported it to the ebcc updated the groupwide modern slavery risk register like the risk assessment the register was subject to the ebccs review issued the modern slavery questionnaire to appropriate third parties and assessed responses following up as required progressed work to map the supply chain of our top categories of nonfuel spend enhanced our risk assessment toolkit by purchasing and implementing a new third party system elevate researched additional tools that could further strengthen our risk assessment processes started to introduce our new supplier code into onboarding and contracting processes in 2021 we plan to continue to introduce our new supplier code into onboarding and contracting processes for new agreements or at the point of renewal for existing agreements continue work to map the supply chain of our top categories of nonfuel spend further strengthen our country risk assessment process by engaging a thirdparty expert implement additional tools to strengthen the risk assessment process as the ebcc deems appropriate due diligence were committed to conducting business with honesty and integrity and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations country and supplier approval our due diligence system automatically calculates the geographic risk of potential suppliers based on several systemhosted indices in relation to modern slavery these include the global slavery index the ebcc must approve higher risk countries before business can be conducted there the ebcc can consider blanket country approvals or specific contract approvals depending on the consolidated commercial interest in that country the ebcc will also consider the level of risk identified with that commercial interest andor the associated supply chain due diligence checks are carried out on suppliers and where appropriate their associated persons and supply chain should we identify concerns during the process we may procure enhanced due diligence from a specialist service provider before escalation to the ebcc the ebcc or executive committee will decide whether to appoint the supplier weve established a due diligence platform which all our business units use both in the uk and the us we use the platform to perform initial due diligence and continually monitor suppliers designated colleagues across our business units review the monitoring alerts in conjunction with a standard companywide process and if appropriate escalate to the group business ethics team modern slavery instances in 2020 our due diligence processes identified no instances of modern slavery progress in 2020 evaluated the appropriateness of our due diligence approach for trial volumes of potential new fuels including benchmarking with another un global compact modern slavery working group member carried out an endtoend review of drax groups due diligence processes and presented the findings to the ebcc 2020 due diligence review reviewed the modern slavery statements of our key freight partners to establish where collaboration might have the most value continued to operate our due diligence processes throughout the pandemic to make sure we could investigate any concerns emerging because of covid19 in 2021 we plan to further strengthen the human rights content of our biomass supplier audits explore additional toolssystems that may enhance draxs due diligence toolkit regarding human rights implement the recommendations identified as part of the 2020 due diligence review seek to collaborate with select freight partners on their due diligence programmes and modern slavery initiatives policies and procedures we expect colleagues to work with our values in mind and to follow our documentation framework which includes our codes policies and procedures in 2020 we developed two codes of conduct the board approved the drax code in september and it was deployed as a mandatory read to all colleagues and nonpermanent workers c 3100 people in october the board approved the supplier code in october and a working group will facilitate its implementation we provide online access to both documents here  drax code supplier code the drax code is supplemented by policies procedures and guidance that provide further information on the obligations applicable to drax and how we ensure compliance with them all our written materials are readily available to colleagues via our group intranet should a colleague fail to meet the standards expected by the business drax commits to fully investigate the matter in line with the relevant terms of employment and disciplinary procedures progress in 2020 continued a group policy project to make sure our mandatory policies are up to date and published on a single platform separated the content of our corporate crime policy into its constituent parts creating a specific policy on human rights reviewed our due diligence guide as part of the 2020 due diligence review in 2021 we plan to continue with the implementation of our supplier code for new agreements or at the point of renewal for existing agreements develop refresher elearning content on our drax code these mandatory principlesbased documents form part of our documentation framework they set out the values and behaviours we expect from our people and from those we conduct business with employment practices we do not tolerate any form of human trafficking forced or bonded labour or the exploitation of children or vulnerable persons in our own business or our supply chains were

lifestyle preferences we also have policies that encourage colleagues to raise grievances or concerns and that support a diverse inclusive and ethical workplace drax is committed to maintaining high standards in its employment practices and to giving colleagues employment security a high proportion of our colleagues are on permanent contracts the risk of modern slavery taking place within our business is much lower than it is through our supply chain even so our recruitment procedures incorporate several steps designed to eliminate such risks including carrying out right to work checks and making sure the agencies we use to supply nonpermanent workers carry out equivalent checks performing preemployment checks to verify the identity of prospective colleagues and to make sure theyre over 16 years of age completing disclosure and barring service checks for specific roles to enable us to make safer recruitment decisions making sure an employment contract is in place before starting
