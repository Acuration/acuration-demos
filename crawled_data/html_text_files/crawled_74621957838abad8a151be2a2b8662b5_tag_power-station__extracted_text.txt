out of the world cup the now famous image of paul gascoigne crying into his shirt is beamed across millions of uk television screens theres a shuffling on the sofas in front of those tvs as the population gets up to make a cup of tea get a drink or turn on the oven millions of kettles lights and fridges are powered up as the country collectively despairs the demand for electricity across the country soars this is whats called a tv pickup  the moment during a popular television event when theres a break and viewers unwittingly cause a huge surge of demand from the national grid its these moments that have caused some of the biggest spikes in uk electricity demand here we look at whats caused them one what football world cup semi final england v west germany when wednesday 4 july 1990 electricity demand 2800mw  equivalent to 1120000 kettles based on 1mw  400 kettles or 43 draxsized generation units there are six 645mw units at drax after that fateful penalty miss the population made for the kitchen the match was watched by an estimated 26 million people in the uk and when full time was called they caused a 2800mw surge in electricity demand two what the thorn birds when 22 january 1984 electricity demand 2600mw  1040000 kettles  4 drax units a sleeper hit the thorn birds was a oneoff american miniseries about a fictional sheep station in the australian outback based on the novel of the same name it was broadcast in the uk following building up a huge following in the us when it was aired in 1983 by the time it arrived on uk shores there was clearly enough of that excitement to create a surge of electricity demand  one of the largest in uk tv history three what football world cup quarter final england v brazil when friday 21 june 2002 electricity demand 2570mw  1028000 kettles  4 drax units broadcast early on a wednesday morning in the uk due to time differences with south korea where the game was played the match saw england put up a solid fight against overall tournament winners brazil a goal from michael owen provided early hope and at half time tv viewers left their screens to cause a huge 2570mw spike in demand by the time the game had reached its conclusion brazil had won thanks to a chipped ronaldinho free kick that fooled england keeper david seaman and those viewers who had lasted the duration caused a slightly smaller 2300mw surge four what eastenders lisa admits shooting phil when thursday 5 april 2001 electricity demand 2290mw  916000 kettles  35 drax units in one of the most dramatic plot developments in uk tv history lisa shaw played by actress lucy benjamin admitted to shooting her former boyfriend phil mitchell an estimated 22 million viewers turned on to see the dramatic reveal when it was all over they caused a surge of

kettles  34 drax units one of the more wholesome entries to the list this british comedy drama racked up a huge following during its 20episode run from 1991 to 1993 the peak was early in the first season when the third ever episode saw the larkin family take an unhappy holiday to brittany the familys escapades drew a large audience and prompted a surge equivalent to 880000 kettles being switched on at the same time six what rugby world cup final england v australia when saturday 22 november 2003 electricity demand 2110mw  844000 kettles  33 drax units a unique sporting entry to the list as england ended as winners more than 12 million people watched england beat australia with the largest electricity demand coming at half time and not at full time when audiences were presumably still celebrating jonny wilkinsons last minute drop goal seven what european football championship 2020 final england vs italy when sunday 11 july 2021 electricity demand 1800mw  720000 kettles  28 drax units the most recent heartbreaker for england fans the match came as covid19 restrictions were only beginning to lift around the uk the team led by gareth southgate conquered old foes germany on their way to a final in wembley only to lose to italy on penalties the sense of disappointment was almost palpable in the energy demand peaking at 1800mw at halftime when england went into the changing rooms onenil up demand then surged again to 1200mw at the end of the 90minute stalemate followed by a deflated 500mw at the end of the game had things gone differently national grid eso was preparing for a peak of 2000mw eight what the royal wedding  prince william and kate when friday 29 april 2011 electricity demand 1600mw  640000 kettles  25 drax units the biggest and most celebrated royal wedding in a generation the marriage of prince william and kate middleton attracted an audience of 24 million in the uk alone energy demand peaked at 1600mw when the brides carriage procession returned to buckingham palace this is the largest tv pickup in recent years which hints at how changing viewer habits on demand watching and smart tvs are changing the need for power and making tv pickups a rarer occurrence nine what clap for carers when thursday 16 april 2020 electricity demand 950mw  320000 kettles  15 drax units covid19 and subsequent lockdowns had several interesting effects on the uks energy system  one feature was a return in regular demand spikes with thursday evenings clap for carers events prompting notable surges the gestures held at 8pm on thursdays between 26 march and 28 may 2020 saw millions across the uk stand outside their homes and clap in appreciation of emergency services workers as people went back inside to put on kettles and turn on tvs electricity demand spiked the particularly cloudy evening of 16 april saw demand reach 950mw as more people reached for light switches how do we deal with tv pickups national grid electricty pylon at sunrise because the level of electricity needed to power the country cant be stored when there is a spike in demand it needs to be met quickly by a similar increase in real time generation to manage the supply and demand for events likely to cause electricity surges the national grid forecasts electricity need for large events like world cups and major tv events the grid can then put contingency measures in place to manage the huge changes in demand in real time it does this through a suite of tools called balancing mechanisms which allows it to access sources of extra power in realtime the rise of more energy efficient home appliances and ondemand streaming means that the shape of electricity demand has become flatter since the days when most of the country was tuned into the same mustsee moments however its still crucial for the grid to forecast periods of high demand when it will keep the necessary power stations on reserve ready to deliver additional electricity if needed if it wasnt for this careful management of electricity by the grid and the power stations like drax supplying it that cup of tea next time england crash out of a major sporting event would not only be

our lives its become something we take for granted rarely do we stop to consider the path it took to become ubiquitous and yet through the course of its history there have been several eureka moments and breakthrough inventions that have shaped our modern lives here are some of the defining moments in the development of electricity and power 2750 bc  electricity first recorded in the form of electric fish ancient egyptians referred to electric catfish as the  thunderers of the nile  and were fascinated by these creatures it led to a near millennia of wonder and intrigue including conducting and documenting crude experiments  such as touching the fish with an iron rod to cause electric shocks 500 bc  the discovery of static electricity around 500 bc thales of miletus discovered that static electricity could be made by rubbing lightweight objects such as fur or feathers on amber this static effect remained unknown for almost 2000 years until around 1600 ad when william gilbert discovered static electricity in earnest 1600 ad  the origins of the word electricity the latin word electricus  which translates to of amber was used by the english physician william gilbert to describe the force exerted when items are rubbed together a few years later english scientist thomas browne translated this into electricity in his written investigations in the field 1751  benjamin franklins experiments and observations on electricity this book of benjamin franklin s discoveries made about the behaviour of electricity was published in 1751 the publication and translation of american founding father scientist and inventors letters would provide the basis for all further electricity experimentation it also introduced a host of new terms to the field including positive negative charge battery and electric shock 1765  james watt transforms the industrial revolution watt studies newcomens engine james watt transformed the industrial revolution with the invention of a modified newcome engine now known as the watt steam engine  machines no longer had to rely on the sometimestemperamental wind water or manpower  instead steam from boiling water could drive the pistons back and forth although watts engine didnt generate electricity it created a foundation that would eventually lead to the steam turbine  still the basis of much of the globes electricity generation today james watts steam engine alessandro volta 1800  voltas first true battery documented records of batterylike objects date back to 250 bc but the first true battery was invented by italian scientist alessandro volta in 1800  volta realised that a current was created when zinc and silver were immersed in an electrolyte  the principal on which chemical batteries are still based today 1800s  the first electrical cars breakthroughs in electric motors and batteries in the early 1800s led to experimentation with electrically powered vehicles the british inventor robert anderson is often credited with developing the first crude electric carriage at the beginning of the 19 th century but it would not be until 1890 that american chemist william morrison would invent the first practical electric car though it closer resembled a motorised wagon boasting a top speed of 14 miles per hour michael faraday 1831  michael faradays electric dynamo faradays invention of the electric dynamo power generator set the precedent for electricity generation for centuries to come his invention converted motive or mechanical power  such as steam gas water and wind turbines  into electromagnetic power at a low voltage although rudimentary it was a breakthrough in generating consistent continuous electricity and opened the door for the likes of thomas edison and joseph swan whose subsequent discoveries would make largescale electricity generation feasible 1879  lighting becomes practical and inexpensive thomas edison patented the first practical and accessible incandescent light bulb  using a carbonised bamboo filament which could burn for more than 1200 hours edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent lightbulb on 31 st december 1879 where he stated that electricity would be so cheap that only the rich would burn candles although he was not the only inventor to experiment with incandescent light his was the most enduring and practical he would soon go on to develop not only the bulb but an entire electrical lighting system  holborn viaduct power station via wikimedia 1882  the worlds first public power station opens holborn viaduct power station also known as the edison electric light station  burnt coal to drive a steam turbine and generate electricity the power was used for holborns newly electrified streetlighting an idea which would quickly spread around london 1880s  tesla and edisons current war nikola tesla and thomas edison waged what came to be known as the current war in 1880s america tesla was determined to prove that alternating current ac  as is generated at power stations  was safe for domestic use going against the edison groups opinion that a direct current dc  as delivered from a battery  was safer and more reliable inside an edison power station in new york the conflict led to years of risky demonstrations and experiments including one where tesla electrocuted himself in front of an audience to prove he would not be harmed the war continued as they fought over the future of electric power generation until eventually ac won nikola tesla 1901  great britains first industrial power station opens before charles mertz and william mclellan of merz  mclellan built the neptune bank power station in tyneside in 1901 individual factories were powered by private generators by contrast the neptune bank power station could supply reliable cheap power to multiple factories that were connected through highvoltage transmission lines this was the beginning of britains national grid system 1990s  the first mass market electrical vehicle ev concepts for electric cars had been around for a century however the general motors ev1 was the first model to be mass produced by a major car brand  made possible with the breakthrough invention of the rechargeable battery however this ev1 model could not be purchased only directly leased on a monthly contract because of this its expensive build and relatively small customer following the model only lasted six years before general motors crushed the majority of their cars 2018  renewable generation accounts

sewage becomes renewable energy 17 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy from traffic pollution to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys

generation is often tied to a countrys geography climate and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots where the landscape makes it possible tags technology  sustainability  power station  cruachan power station  hydroelectric

another 28 gw of pumped hydro storage capacity but it remains a small part of the overall electricity mix in the fourth quarter of 2018 the 65 of british hydropower that is connected to the national grid accounted for less than one per cent electricity generation or 545600 megawatt hours mwh by contrast wind accounted for 14 of total generation that quarter almost 95 million mwh while hydropower projects can be expensive to construct operational and maintenance costs are relatively low and they can run for an extremely long time  the lanark hydro electric scheme in scotland which drax recently acquired  has been producing power since 1927 today hydropower installations are found at all scales all around the world but the term hydropower covers many different types of facility these are some of the ways water is used to generate electricity impoundment power plants the simplest and most recognisable form of hydropower impoundment facilities work by creating a reservoir of trapped water behind a dam that is then selectively released the water flows through a turbine spinning it which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity from the hoover dam on the nevadaarizona border to the three gorges dam in china  the worlds largest power station of any type with a generating capacity of 225 gw  impoundment dams are some of the most iconic structures in modern engineering three gorges dam china as well as having the potential to provide large quantities of baseload power they can react extremely quickly to grid demands  just by opening or closing their floodgates as the power system operator requires runofriver generation rather than storing and releasing power from behind a dam runoftheriver generators channel off part of a river and use its natural flow to generate power tongland power station galloway hydro scheme because it doesnt require large dams or reservoirs runofriver can be less environmentally disruptive as there is not always a need for large scale construction and flooding is less common stonebyres power station lanark hydro scheme while runofriver facilities tend to be smaller and less flexible than impoundment they still have significant generating potential  the jirau hydroelectric power plant on the madeira river in brazil has a generating capacity of 37 gw pumped storage water can also be good for storing energy that can then be converted to electricity pumped hydro storage facilities operate by pumping water uphill to a reservoir when electricity is cheap or plentiful then letting it flow back downhill through tunnels to a series of turbines that activate generators to generate electricity in the same way as an impoundment dam when electricity is in high demand dam and reservoir cruachan power station their ability to both produce and absorb electricity makes them a vital part of electricity networks playing the role of energy storage systems  in fact a massive 97 of all global grid storage capacity is in the form of pumped hydro their function as giant batteries will only become more important as intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar become more prevalent in the energy mix outlet and loch cruachan power station so too will their ability to ramp up generation very quickly draxs recently acquired cruachan power station in scotland can go from zero to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds when generation is called upon  for example when there is a sudden spike in demand tidal range generation swansea bay the sea is also an enormous source of potential hydropower tidal range generation facilities exploit the movement of water levels between and high and low tide to generate electricity tidal dams trap water in bays or estuaries at high tide creating lagoons the dam then releases the water as the rest of the tide lowers allowing it to pass through turbines generating power there are limitations  like wind and solars dependence on the wind blowing and the level of sunlight operators cant control when tides go in or out but its vast generating potential means that it could be a valuable source of baseload power if it were to be deployed more widely great britain in particular has major opportunities for tidal generation the severn estuary between england and wales has the second highest tidal range in the world 15 metres and a barrage built across the estuary could have a generating capacity of up to 86 gw  enough to meet 6 of the britains total electricity demands some environmental groups worry about the impact such projects could have on wildlife due to the level of public funding required the government rejected that plan in 2010 in favour of pursuing its nuclear policy  a second attempt at securing a governmentbacked investment contract known as a cfd  for a smaller 320 mw pathfinder project in swansea bay was also rejected in 2018 the welsh government is however supportive of the project which already has planning permission tidal stream generation rather than building a dam tidal stream generators work like underwater wind turbines sturdy propellers or hydrofoils winglike blades which oscillate up and down rather than spinning around are positioned underwater to transform the energy of tidal streams into electricity while tidal streams move far slower than wind the high density of water compared to air means that more power is generated even at much lower velocities not reliant on large physical structures tidal stream generators are a relatively cheap form of hydropower to deploy and make a much smaller impact on their environment than tidal barrages wave generation unlike tidal power which is generated by the gravitational effects of the sun and moon on the earths oceans wave power ultimately comes from the winds that whip up the oceans surface there are a number of different methods that turn waves into generation including funnelling waves into a tube floating on the surface of the water that contains electricitygenerating turbines or by using the vertical bobbing movement of a tethered buoy to pull and spin a fixed generator an electricitygenerating buoy awaiting installation in spain wave power has yet to be widely implemented but it has significant potential its estimated that the waves off the coasts of the usa could have provided 66 of the countrys electricity generation needs in 2017 alone effectively commercialising wave power could provide another vital tool in developing a sustainable energy landscape for the coming future tidal and wave power generation are less established generation technologies than their landbased cousins but they hold huge potential in delivering more sources of reliable zero emissions electricity for energy

causes power cuts 16 january 2019 power generation on the night of 5 december 2015 61000 homes and properties across lancaster were plunged into darkness storm desmond had unleashed torrents of rain on great britain causing rivers to swell and spill over with waters rising to unprecedented levels the river lune began threatening to flood lancasters main electricity substation the facility where transformers step down electricitys voltage from the transmission system so it can be distributed safely around the local area to prevent unrepairable damage the decision was taken to switch the substation off cutting all power across the region lights phones internet connections and atms all went dead across the city it would take three days of intensive work before power was restored it was a bigger power outage than most but it offers a unique glimpse into the mechanisms behind a blackout  not only how theyre dealt with but how theyre caused what causes blackouts in great britain flooded electricity sub station in lancaster sunday 6 december 2015 when the lights go out a common thought is that the country has run out of electricity however a lack of electricity generation is almost never the cause of outages only during the miners strikes of 1972 were major power cuts the result of lack of electricity production rather than meeting electricity demand power cuts in great britain are more often the result of disruption to the transmission system caused by unpredictable weather if trees or piles of snow bring down one power line the load of electric current shifts to other lines  if this sudden jump in load is too much for the other lines they automatically trip offline to prevent damage to the equipment this in turn shifts the load on to other lines which also then trip potentially causing cascading outages across the network last marchs beast from the east  which brought six days of near subzero temperatures deep snow and high winds to great britain is an example of extreme weather cutting electricity to as many as 18000 people  highwinds brought trees and branches down onto powerlines while ice and snow impacted the millions of components that make up the electricity system engineering teams had to fight the elements and make the repairs needed to get electricity flowing again lancaster was different however with the slow creep of rising rainwater approaching the substation the threat of long lasting damage was plain to see in advance and so rather than waiting for it to autotrip authorities chose to manually shut it down getting reconnected an emergency generator brought from london is reversed into position adjacent to the sub station in bold street morecambe near lancaster monday 7 december 2015 electricity north west is lancasters network operator and after shutting down the substation it began the intensive job of trying to restore power on monday 7 december two days after the storm hit the first step of pumping the flooded substation empty of water had finally been completed and the task of reconnecting it began to begin restoring power to the region 75 large mobile generators were brought from as far away as the west country and northern ireland and hooked up to the substation allowing 22000 customers to be reconnected once partial power was restored the next challenge lay in repairing and reconnecting the substation to the transmission network while shutting the facility had prevented catastrophic damage some of the crucial pieces had to be completely replaced or rebuilt after three days of intensive engineering work the remaining 40000 properties that had lost power were reconnected preventing blackouts in a changing system the cause and scale of lancasters outage were unusual for great britains electricity system but it does highlight how quickly a power cut may arise in a time of transition when the grid is decarbonising and the network is facing more extreme weather conditions because of climate change it could create even more new challenges coal is scheduled to be taken entirely off the system after 2025 making the country more reliant on weatherdependent sources such as wind and solar  potentially increasing the volatility of the system on the other hand growing decentralised electricity generation may reduce the number of individual buildings affected by outages in the future solar generation and storage systems present on domestic and commercial property may also reduce dependency on local transmission systems and the impact of disruptions to it the cables and poles that connect the transmission system will always be vulnerable to faults and disruptions however by preparing for the future grid great britain can reduce the impact of storms on the electricity

grid  electricity  electricity generation how turbines came to power the world 5 september 2018 power generation charles algernon parsons knew he was onto something in 1884 the young engineer had joined a ship engineering firm and developed a steam turbine engine which he immediately saw had a bigger potential than powering boats he connected it to a dynamo turning it into a generator capable of producing up to 75 kilowatts kw of power and in the process kickstarted an electrical and mechanical revolution that would reshape how electricity was produced and how the world worked today turbinebased generation is the dominant method for electricity production throughout the world and even now  almost a century and a half later  parsons turbine concept remains largely unchanged even if the world around it has steam dreams throughout the 20 th and into the current century electricity generation has depended on steam power be it in a coal nuclear or biomass power plant heating water into highly pressurised steam is at the core of production greek mathematician and inventor hero of alexandria is cited as building the first ever steam engine of sorts with his aeolipile  which used steam to spin a hollow metal sphere but it wasnt until the 18 th century when english ironmonger thomas newcomen designed an  albeit inefficient  engine to pump water out of flooded mines that steam became a credible power in industry scottish engineer james watt from whose name the unit of energy comes from built on these humble beginnings and turned steam into the power behind the industrial revolution around 1764 when he added an condensing chamber to newcomens original design  it was the combination of this engine with thomas edisons electrical generator late in the 19 th century that first made largescale electricity production from steam a reality the turbine takes over steam engines and steam power was not a new concept when parson began his explorations in the space in fact nor were steam turbines others had explored ways to use streams velocity to spin blades rather than using its pressure to pump pistons in turn allowing rotors to spin at much greater speeds while requiring less raw fuel what made parsons design so important was its ability to keep rotational speeds moderate while also extracting as much kinetic energy from steam jets as possible he explained in a 1911 rede lecture that this was done by splitting up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series which ensured there was no one place the velocity of the blades was too great the designs strength was also apparent at scale in 1900 his company which was eventually acquired by siemens  was building turbinegenerator units capable of producing 1000 kw of electricity by 1912 however the company was installing a 25000 kw unit for the city of chicago parsons would live to see units reach 50000 kw and become the primary source of electricity generation around the world turbines in the modern grid the world is a vastly different place to the one in which parson designed his turbine yet the fundamentals of his concept have changed very little the results of what they achieve and the scales at which they work however have increased significantly today the turbines that make up draxs six generating units are each capable of producing more than 600 mw or 6000000 kw of electricity with the shape materials and arrangement of blades carefully designed to maximise efficiency and while that first design was purely with steam in mind turbine technology has advanced beyond dependency on a single power source and has been developed to accommodate for the shift towards lowercarbon power sources one such example is gas turbines which work by sucking in air through a compressor which is then heated by burning natural gas in turn spinning a turbine as it expands these can jump into action much faster than other turbines as they dont require any steam to be created to power them renewable sources such as hydro and wind power also depend on spinning turbines to generate electricity where these differ from gas or steampowered turbines is that rather than being encased in metal and blasted with gases wind and hydro turbines blades are exposed so flowing air or water can spin them powering a generator in turn turbine technology helped bring access to electricity around the world but the ingenuity and flexibility of the design means it is now serving to adapt electricity production for the
