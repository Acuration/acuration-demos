robust trading and operational performance and resilient sustainable biomass supply chain  drax is in a strong position to support its employees business customers and communities during the covid19 crisis while continuing to generate returns for shareholders drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload as an important part of the uks critical national infrastructure we recognise our responsibility to support the countrys response to covid19 we have strong business continuity plans in place and are in close contact with the uk government our dedicated teams across england scotland and wales supported by our us biomass colleagues and business partners are working around the clock to generate and supply the flexible lowcarbon and renewable electricity the uk needs not least to the 250000 businesses including care homes hospitals and schools we supply the group is also providing support for communities and others affected by covid19 nevertheless it is still early in this pandemic as covid19 continues to develop we remain vigilant in looking to protect all our stakeholders and will report further if there are significant changes to our outlook for 2020 trading operational performance and outlook the trading and operational performance of the group has been robust in the first three months of 2020 while the impact of covid19 is still unfolding the groups expectations for 2020 adjusted ebitda are currently in line with consensus inclusive of an estimated potential impact from covid19 of 60 million principally in relation to its customers business full year expectations for the group remain underpinned by good operational availability for the remainder of 2020 in the customers business the consequences of covid19 are only now starting to become visible it is expected to result in reduced demand and a potential increase in bad debt which represents a major sensitivity particularly in the sme 4 market as a result drax has significantly increased its expectation of potential customer business failures and higher bad debt assuming the continued impact of covid19 throughout 2020 drax now expects a full year adjusted ebitda loss for the customers business the group will closely monitor the impact on the customers business and update the market accordingly in generation the groups expectations for the full year reflect a reduction in roc recycle prices resulting from reduced power demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio the performance of the generation business is dependent on the continuation of biomass deliveries to drax power station biomass generation is currently the most material area of activity for the group and a protracted suspension of the supply chain could lead to lower levels of biomass generation resulting in a reduction in the groups expectations for the full year at present there has been no impact from covid19 and the group has a good supply of biomass throughout the supply chain which continues to be robust and functioning well engineer climbs cooling tower at drax power station click to viewdownload generation during the first three months of 2020 draxs generation portfolio performed well with good asset availability and optimisation of generation underpinning a strong financial performance the business benefits from a strong forward power sales position through 2022 which combined with indexlinked renewable schemes and capacity payments provides a high level of earnings visibility helping to protect the business from the current weakness in uk power prices in response to covid19 drax has implemented robust business continuity procedures across its sites to protect employees and contractors and ensure continued operation in addition to operating strategically important infrastructure the components of the groups uk supply chain are considered key sectors allowing continued operation the groups biomass supply chain has a high level of operational redundancy designed to mitigate any potential disruption drax sources biomass from suppliers across north america and europe including the groups own facilities in louisiana and mississippi in the uk drax utilises dedicated port facilities at hull immingham tyne and liverpool with a capacity of eleven million tonnes providing supply chain capacity in excess of the groups annual biomass usage of over seven million tonnes sustainable biomass wood pellets destined for drax power station unloaded from the zheng zhi bulk carrier at abp immingham click to viewdownload drax power station has 300000 tonnes of biomass storage capacity taken together with volumes throughout its supply chain the group currently has visibility of over one million tonnes of biomass in transit  enough to operate the cfd 5 unit on its own for over four months subject to managing deliveries to drax power station biomass generation has performed well in the first three months of 2020 whilst covid19 has not had any measurable impact on biomass generation to date a sustained reduction in electricity demand could result in a reduction in roc recycle prices in the current compliance period the group has adjusted its expectations for the full year but the precise impact will be dependent on the depth and duration of any reduction in demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio engineer at cruachan power station click to viewdownload the groups hydro assets have performed well particularly the pumped storage business primarily driven by activity in the system support services market as previously disclosed cruachan pumped storage power station was successful in a tender process run by the system operator to procure inertia and reactive power services the contract is worth up to c5 million per year over six years and is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2020 this was the first tender of its kind and reflects the growing importance of system support services as the generation market becomes increasingly supplied by intermittent renewable power sources the system operator is expected to conduct further tenders over the coming year thermal generation is performing in line with draxs expectations pellet production lasalle bioenergy wood pellet manufacturing plant in louisiana click to viewdownload pellet production has performed well in the first three months of 2020 at present there has been no disruption to production caused by covid19 although the state of louisiana is experiencing a high number of cases the semiautomated nature of the pellet production process limits the need for individuals to be in contact with each other and this has been enhanced by robust business continuity procedures to further reduce the risk to employees and contractors drax continues to monitor developments closely and notes that energy rail port and forestry are designated key sectors in the usa allowing continued operation customers the groups customers business which sells power gas and energy services to the ic 6 and sme markets has seen a significant reduction in demand as a result of covid19 the group has been working to assess the potential impact of this demand reduction the increased risk of business failure and bad debt the impact is expected to be most pronounced in the sme market which represents c30 percent of monthly billing the impact is expected to be partially mitigated by credit insurance in respect of certain customers balance sheet at 31 december 2019 drax had 404 million of cash which increased to 454 million at 31 march 2020 the groups plan for 2020 included capital investment of 230250 million with half of this assigned to strategic investment in biomass expansion and cost reduction whilst the group continues to see its biomass strategy as both a primary long and shortterm source of value drax is reviewing the timing of its investment programme in 2020 and in the shortterm investment is expected to be lower at 31 march 2020 net debt had reduced to 818m million and drax continues to target around 2 x net debt to ebitda for the full year the group has available cash and committed facilities of 663 million including a cash line available within a 315 million revolving credit facility rcf which is currently undrawn and matures in april 2021 the group has an esg facility with final maturity in 2022 and a 350m sterling bond which matures in 2022 the group has a further 500 million fixed rate usd bond maturing in 2025 and infrastructure private placement loans maturing through 20242029 the groups facilities include a maintenance covenant which if triggered requires a minimum ebitda level requirement around 40 of 2020 current consensus adjusted ebitda customary covenants apply to all other facilities the groups rolling fiveyear foreign exchange hedge book continues to provide protection from the recent weakness in sterling to 2025 the group actively manages risk limits with counterparties providing forward foreign exchange contracts and the current weakness in sterling has led to the rebasing of a number of contracts resulting in the acceleration of cash flows from these contracts to the benefit of drax contracted power sales as at 16 april 2020 the power sales contracted for 2020 2021 and 2022 were as follows 2020 2021 2022 power sales twh comprising 167 96 43  fixed

remain an important part of the groups earnings but by focusing on flexible renewable and lowcarbon generation which includes indexlinked renewable schemes capacity payments and system support services the impact of power prices has reduced exposure to merchant power prices by generation asset class biomass cfd  power produced by this unit is remunerated based on an indexlinked strike price and underpinned by a private law contract which runs until march 2027 at baseload the unit is expected to produce over 5twh per year the current strike price is c116mwh and taken together with a biomass cost at or below c75mwh gives a margin of over 40mwh and an annual contribution to gross profit of over 200 million with daily cash settlement in 30 days biomass roc  roc buyout prices are indexlinked and extend to march 2027 acting as a premium on uk power prices the buyout price for the current compliance period is 5005 per roc annual generation is in the region of 910 twh with the associated power sold up to two years forward providing strong earnings visibility over the period 202021 hydro  a small but profitable volume of merchant power generation 144mw with zero fuel cost

operational leverage and cost reduction these savings will be delivered through further optimisation of existing biomass operations greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues and an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other lowcost renewable fuels across its expanded selfsupply chain drax remains alert to sector opportunities for organic and inorganic growth by 2027 these activities would enable drax to develop a biomass generation business operating without the current renewable schemes and potentially the development of beccs 8  subject to the right support from the uk government drax notes the incremental progress and support announced for carbon capture and storage at the uk governments budget in march 2020 these efforts support the groups ambition to become a
