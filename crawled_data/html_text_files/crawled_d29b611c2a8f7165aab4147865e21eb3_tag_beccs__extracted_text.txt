beccs raising the standard in carbon removals 4 october 2023 opinion by angela hepworth commercial director at drax in their sixth assessment report the intergovernmental panel on climate change has clearly stated that to limit warming to 15c we will need carbon dioxide removals cdrs on a gigaton scale the magnitude of this challenge lays starkly before us but in equal measure with the size of the task its importance has never been more evident its long been accepted that the world must decarbonise by reducing emissions but the necessity of carbon removals is more newly recognised cdrs are now acknowledged to be a crucial part of the effort to achieve net zero emissions both to neutralise hardtoabate emissions and sectors like mining transportation and aviation and to remove excess historic carbon or overshoot already in the atmosphere at drax we are developing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously engineered carbon removal technologies like beccs are crucial to achieving longterm climate goals beccs is the most scalable of these technologies that can be deployed rapidly and is affordable compared with other permanent removal solutions credibility transparency and trust historically the voluntary carbon market has struggled with demonstrating credibility transparency and trust and this has proven to be a significant weight on the industrys ability to scale we have seen reports of lowquality offsets sold as high integrity credits and projects that dont deliver the carbon benefits claimed which has diminished investor trust in the market as a whole to address these concerns we are now seeing significant initiatives being put in place to implement the high standards and good governance in carbon removals credits that we need to effectively scale the market to levels required the integrity council for the voluntary carbon markets icvcm is a prime example of this serving as an independent governance body for the voluntary carbon market the icvcm is working to champion standards across the industry and has set out its core carbon principles ccps  set of principles that all carbon offsets and removals must meet in order to be considered high integrity we welcome this initiative and hope it will raise standards across the market similar to what we are seeing in the ai industry at present in order to build trust in this nascent market and in turn scale it it is also imperative that industry looks outside of itself and engages with other stakeholders who are impacted or interested in it we must develop ethical principles and guidelines for the design development and deployment of carbon markets implement transparent and accountable mechanisms for the oversight and governance of them educate and engage the public and stakeholders on the benefits of cdrs empower and protect the customers and foster collaboration and dialogue among the industry academia civil society and policymakers why we need standards for beccs at drax we already recognise that addressing quality concerns is the only way that the market will work for everybody  buyers rightly want to have confidence that they are buying a highintegrity removals which are robustly quantified and verified sellers need to be able to demonstrate the validity of their claims and government needs a wellfunctioning market and a baseline from which to regulate it our partnership with stockholm exergi and ecoengineers is doing just that  developing a worldleading methodology to ensure the integrity of beccs cdrs the methodology was created to align with the icvcms ccps and to closely consider how to ensure everyone around the table is getting what they need quantification for the methodology to be successful it requires a thorough approach to quantifying netnegative carbon removals from beccs quantification in the methodology starts with the gross volume of co2 we capture and store then subtracts any supply chain emissions andor emissions associated with the carbon capture and storage process as well as any leakage impacts increases in co2 emissions outside the project boundary we have intentionally developed this approach to be both robust and conservative so that beccs cdrs verified under the methodology are a truly net negative product guardrails it is also crucial in any methodology for beccs that there are robust guardrails in place to ensure biomass used comes from sustainable sources  for example from forests where the carbon stock is stable or increasing and excluding biomass sourced from sensitive areas where theres high levels of biodiversity our methodology also provides that any potential social or environmental risks must be evaluated and mitigated for biomass to be used verification we aim to register our credits with one of the major registries and once a methodology is adopted we will ensure that our credits are independently verified to confirm that they meet all the requirements set out in the standard and that there is robust governance in place for example to ensure credits cannot be double counted taking the methodology forward pioneering this work for beccs standards is an important step toward increasing investment in beccs cdrs  a climate critical technology  and it needs to be done collaboratively it has been developed in partnership with stockholm exergy and ecoengineers and we are now working to gather feedback from other stakeholders with the aim of making it comprehensive and representative as a part of this wed like to invite further feedback  from other developers standards bodies potential customers and others and welcome constructive comment on the text the methodology has also been submitted to the european commission to help shape their proposals for the framework for cdrs that they are developing it is in the interest of all parties to work towards common standards for cdrs to avoid current fragmentation of standards that causes confusion for customers and we appreciate your feedback on this important work as we drive it forward capturing the opportunity we have an opportunity to change our current climate trajectory but that will only happen if we take action now we to need to reduce emissions and rapidly scale the market for high integrity sustainable cdrs putting the required standards and governance into place to build a resilient and trustworthy carbon removals market is a core part of that we hope that this methodology has a part to play in that work and that it will bring us one step closer to manifesting the potential of beccs done well at scale read the methodology read the executive

as part of the update desnz set out its draft expectation to run the track1 extension and track2 processes in parallel subject to ts capacity and ministerial sign off following the designation of the viking ccs cluster as a track2 cluster in july 2023 there are now two potential routes which could support the drax power station beccs project and wider ccs in the humber region by 2030  the east coast cluster and viking ccs cluster desnz also set out an indicative timeline that shortlisted projects would commence negotiations from autumn 2024 desnz will now receive feedback on its draft proposals pending further updates and the publication of final guidance in due course will gardiner drax ceo said the governments statements are a helpful step forward not just for beccs in the uk but for the wider fight against climate change we can only reach net zero by investing in critical new green technologies such as beccs i welcome the governments draft position and urge them to progress with both track1 expansion and track2 processes in parallel this winter separately in august 2023 the uk government published a biomass strategy which set out its position on the use of biomass in the uks plans for delivering net zero the biomass strategy outlined the potential  extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon dioxide removals this is in addition to formal bilateral discussions between drax and the government in relation to a potential bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of beccs at drax power station enquiries drax investor relations

globally 20 september 2023 opinion by kasia wilk head of public affairs and policy for e urope and asia drax key takeaways certification of carbon removals provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes eus proposed certification mechanism is first of its kind but does not fully reflect the international dimension of carbon markets it is unclear how removals outside of the eu and certificates issued outside of the eu will be treated this might be problematic in the longer run  in particular in light of the foreseen enduses of the certified carbon removal units if the eu recognises and handles this challenge it could lead the world in carbon removals certification eu climate policies should prioritise support for carbon removal solutions that are technically ready economically feasible permanent and have additional cobenefits bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously sustainability of biomass is heavily regulated by the renewable energy directive red it is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world it applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against oversourcing why do we need carbon removals july was the hottest month ever recorded the impact of climate change is being felt here and now tackling the causes of global warming is now more pressing than ever we are currently on track for a 14 rise in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 this could lead to temperatures increasing by more than double the paris climate agreements 15 degrees target and bringing about even more extreme weather urgent action is needed now to revert this catastrophic trend its increasingly clear that carbon dioxide removal cdr will be essential to reach net zero by 2050 as these technologies balance out those emissions that are difficult to avoid as well as help companies remove their historic emissions they do so by capturing carbon dioxide co2 that is already in the atmosphere and removing it and storing it permanently according to the sixth assessment report of the uns ipcc nearly all pathways to net zero by 2050 will require a significant scaleup of carbon removals carbon removal technologies are developing at pace and can make a significant contribution to climate policies nevertheless to get the sector to where it needs to be by midcentury requires the right policies and investment to support deployment the eu has already taken a number of steps to support the development of carbon removals in the region the ccs directive establishes a regulatory framework for the geological storage of co2 and the proposal for a carbon removal certification framework crcf will support the development of a voluntary carbon market which is a cornerstone for the development of cdr however to support the scaling up of the sector it is essential to 1 assess the scale of removals required 2 define binding eu targets and 3 develop roadmaps for the scale up of carbon removals in europe it is also important to coordinate member state commitments ensuring their plans for deployment can be realised through greater cooperation the importance of certification certification of carbon removals is essential for driving technological development and deployment it provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes we need transparent and robust rules and procedures to ensure that only highquality removals and removals that would not have taken place are credited and to prevent the same activity from being certified twice or using the same certificate twice this is what the eu proposal for a regulation establishing a union certification framework for carbon removals aims to do the proposed certification mechanism is a worldfirst and positions the eu as the leader in the field addressing the need for removals in climate policy and providing a stringent transparent regulatory oversight on certification it has the potential to set highquality criteria create much needed standards for growing the carbon removal market and address many of the shortcomings that hamper its growth today yet the scope of the eu certification proposal does not go far enough it is currently limited to removals within the eu and it is unclear how removals outside of the eu and certificates issued outside of the eu will be treated despite the important international dimension of climate policy the european commission has said that international carbon markets can play a key role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions costeffectively although specifics are still under development the paris agreement provides a robust and ambitious basis for the use of international markets and reinforces international targets transparency and the accountability recognising the importance of international carbon markets article 6 of the agreement allows parties to use international trading of emission allowances to help achieve emissions reduction targets establishes a framework for common robust accounting rules and creates a new more ambitious market mechanism the lack of international consideration in the commissions proposals for certifying carbon removals could be challenging in the long run  particularly in light of the foreseen end uses of certified removal units including their international exchange through voluntary carbon markets to mitigate this the commission should consider two additional scenarios as part of the discussions on the scope of this voluntary certification framework credits generated outside the eu  eu businesses will still be able to use voluntary markets to purchase credits from projects in other jurisdictions outside of the eu these could not be subject to the same high standards unless they are being given the option to comply with the voluntary framework linking compliance markets  while integration of carbon removals with the ets framework is only being discussed and will be assessed by the european commission over the next few years this proposal should take account of future potential linking of compliance markets should removals be fungible in those linked ets markets it will be within the eus interest to ensure removals outside the eu are subject to the requirements and standards of the eu crcf how to assess and compare the existing cdrs methods all carbon removal methods will have a role to play however they all differ in terms of process permanence and technological readiness to reach its net zero targets eu climate policies should prioritise support for carbon removal solutions that are technically ready economically feasible and permanent they should take into account additional cobenefits for local communities power systems and the environment as well as the potential to be deployed at scale to ensure these technologies can make maximum contribution to the achievement of eu climate goals beccs is one of the best examples of this when compared to other technologies beccs is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously whilst generating thousands of jobs across its value chain it is also very well regulated sustainability of biomass is already covered by the renewable energy directive red the sustainability criteria for biomass in red were updated in 2023 and has been formally adopted by the european parliament it is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world it applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against oversourcing it also safeguards biodiversity ensures forest regeneration and sets strict limits on all supply chain emissions including transportation the 2023 revision of the red specifically took account of the projected growth in biomass demand to 2050 including for beccs and amended the sustainability criteria appropriately beccs projects will see carbon capture equipment installed in plants that will also produce power heat or fuels in many cases the technology will be retrofitted to existing plants regulatory consistency here will be paramount the detailed methodologies that will be developed under the certification framework will need to reflect the vast array of existing regulations such as red to support deployment of these technologies stimulate investment  and ascertain eu climate leadership  supporting domestic technologies or technologies in the region tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  beccs  carbon removal biomass and beccs are essential in the uks journey to net zero 10 august 2023 opinion the strategy provides an important steer on the short medium and longterm use of biomass in the uks 2050 net zero target with the governments strategy in hand i am more certain than ever on two things first that there remains a clear and powerful role for biomass and beccs in helping the uk balance harder to abate sectors like aviation and reach net zero and secondly that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs has a vital role to play in our global energy transition  and that drax is well placed to deliver why we should be confident in developing the strategy the government has considered several factors including availability of biomass and the priorities for end use impacts on air quality the sustainability of biomass use as well as the role of beccs in helping to reach our longterm climate goals the priority use framework evaluates where biomass would be most sustainably and efficiently used across sectors given supply constraints this framework is an important tool which has been developed with four key principles in mind sustainability air quality the circular economy and resource efficiency and ability to support us getting to net zero critically the priority use framework states that in the shortterm 2020s government will continue to facilitate sustainable biomass deployment through a range of incentives and requirements covering power heat and transport in the mediumterm to 2035 government intends to further develop biomass use for utilities such as heat and power with a view to where possible transition to beccs biomass for use in beccs should be prioritised in the long term to 2050 its very encouraging to see government recognise the important role that biomass plays in our energy transition in both the short and medium term as well as its prioritisation of beccs in the long term although there are various routes for deploying beccs across different industries the strategy further prioritises the deployment of beccs on existing biomass generation plants with established supply chains further supported by the development of the powerbeccs business model for the first beccs projects the strategy is also promising as it presents an evidencedriven basis for longterm policy stability and i believe if the government continues in this direction it will draw investment to the uks bioenergy industry why this is critical for the country biomass has already played an important role in supporting energy security while helping the uk decarbonise displacing fossil fuels with a source of renewable dispatchable power our work has also made a significant contribution to the uk economy adding an estimated 18 billion to the uk gdp and supporting 17800 jobs in 2021 alone and looking to the future beccs presents an enormous opportunity to the uk early investment in this critical technology has the potential to support energy security and climate targets whilst creating jobs and making the uk a leader in the potentially trilliondollar global cdr market this work needs to happen now  nearly all realistic pathways to limit warming to 15c require the carbon removal technology and renewable power beccs offers and expert voices at the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change the uks climate change committee and forum for the future have said that carbon removals will be needed to address the climate crisis todays strategy is a clear signal from government that they recognise the importance of beccs and the urgency with which we must employ it within the uk why this is encouraging for drax drax is an international growing sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security and i believe the strategy we have seen from government today is a clear indication of their support for the work that we do with beccs drax has the ability to become a global leader in carbon removals technology we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in transforming drax power station into the worlds largest carbon removals project the prioritisation of beccs within the priority use framework shows the government is aligned to this vision as we look forward we welcome the governments biomass strategy and will continue to unpack what it means for our business over the coming days and weeks with a mind to our next steps government must now ensure that as it progresses its consultation on biomass sustainability that that process is equally evidencedriven and ensures that sciencebased methods drive the policy forward we hope to continue to work alongside government to support these efforts our formal discussions with the uk government on beccs and a bridging mechanism to support the transition to beccs have been productive but to realise the scale of the ambition included in the governments strategy we need commitment through the delivery of a clear business model that supports beccs todays support from government brings us a big step closer and we look forward to continuing the work
