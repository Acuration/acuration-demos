Press Release
New smart meter to give Drax’s business customers more control of their energy
17 June 2020
Press releases

Trial of polyphase SMETS 2 smart meters aimed at giving Drax’s larger business customers better control of their power use, making them more sustainable
The trial is the first of its kind to develop technology that will pave the way for more sophisticated smart metering solutions
The technology needed to install the newest smart meters in businesses with larger and more complex electricity supplies, such as schools or large commercial premises hasn’t been available, so some of the largest energy users have been unable to benefit from the smartest technologies.
Polyphase SMETS2 smart meters will allow larger businesses to track their energy usage, and use the same software used by the millions of single-phase smart meters installed in homes and small businesses across the UK.
The new technology could enable Drax’s energy supply businesses, Haven Power and Opus Energy, to offer large business customers access to smart metering technology, giving them greater control over their energy use with the potential to operate more sustainably.
Paul Sheffield, Managing Director of Drax’s customers business, said:
“We’re confident that this new smart meter technology is going to be a game changer for thousands of our larger customers.
“This technology will enable them to enjoy greater flexibility and control over their electricity use, making them more sustainable, which will be good for both the environment and their bottom line.”
The meters will be field tested with selected Drax business customers, such as utilities and large NHS Trusts, in the autumn.
The work by Drax, the DCC and EDMI has continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic with all partners working remotely to develop and test the technology.
The project has included establishing a new polyphase smart meter testing lab, where the new technology is being developed within the DCC’s Manchester facility, the operational headquarters of Britain’s smart meter network. The facility can test 2,400 smart meters simultaneously and has a technical operation centre which can monitor the install and operation of every smart meter across the country.
The new smart meters will operate securely on the network, using a specialist software platform from Utiligroup, a key technology-services partner of Drax.
Dan Lambert, Chief Operating Officer for the DCC, said:
“The DCC’s network is the digital backbone of the energy industry, and our customers like Drax are constantly working to help us extend its reach to more homes and businesses. Polyphase smart meters will make it available to even more businesses, from farms to tech start-ups.
“It’s been impressive how well the whole sector has collaborated throughout lockdown on this complex work. With our customers, we’re making Britain more connected so we can all lead smarter, greener lives.”
Alan Masterman, Managing Director of smart meter manufacturer EDMI Europe Limited, said:
“We are incredibly proud of the work this partnership is achieving. Smart meters are the foundation of the energy revolution and are therefore an essential component for large businesses that have previously not had access to smart technology.
“At EDMI we are committed to the development of products that best meet market demands, for our customers. The close working of both Drax and the DCC has resulted in the development and creation of a meter that supports the continued expansion of the smart meter programme.”

Spokesperson statement on Drax Power Station Unit 6 testing
16 June 2020
Press releases

Essential maintenance has been carried out on one of our coal generating units as is usual during the spring and summer months when demand is lower, and the coal units are not required to run. Following the completion of this work we need to make sure the unit is performing well, ready for the winter when demand for power increases and the coal units are expected to run. As a result, tests are being carried out now which require the unit to generate power.
Ends
Notes to editors
Drax has announced it
will stop generating power using coal in March 2021
, well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline.
The power station’s transformation from coal to converting two-thirds of its units to using sustainably sourced biomass wood pellets is Europe’s largest decarbonisation project.
Drax has set a commitment
to become carbon negative by 2030
through pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
A BECCS pilot at the power station is already
capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide

£1.1m refurbishment of historic Drax hydro power station
10 June 2020
Press releases

The Lanark hydro scheme, which comprises both Stonebyres and Bonnington power stations, was the first large-scale hydroelectric scheme in Britain when it was completed in 1927 – producing enough electricity for around 17,000 homes.
Using the plentiful supply of water from the River Clyde to spin the power stations’ turbines, the hydro scheme can operate almost continuously throughout the year to provide a reliable and sustainable source of renewable electricity.
Senior civil engineer, Anne Kerr, and Head of Hydro, Ian Kinnaird, view the station from a bridge over the river Clyde.
The refurbishment of the power station was a complex task due to Stonebyres being a category A listed building – the highest possible grading, as a result of it being designated as a site of
national architectural importance
.
The restoration of the historic site was led by Drax Group senior civil engineer Anne Kerr.
“Restoring Stonebyres has been a labour of love for my team,” she explained.
“It was a complex and challenging project, involving a great deal of care to protect the station’s many original features. It has been a real privilege to not only safeguard Stonebyres’ history but to play a part in its future too.”
Anne Kerr and Ian Kinnaird in front of the newly refurbished power station.
As part of the project, every original pane of glass and window frame in the building was painstakingly replaced using stronger, modern materials, but which retain the station’s original design. The power station’s exterior received a new concrete coating as well as a coat of mineral-based paint to protect the integrity of the building for decades to come.
The £1.1m refurbishment has transformed Stonebyres.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Head of Hydro, said:
“Stonebyres Power Station has been producing reliable, renewable electricity for almost a century, and this major refurbishment will ensure it continues to do so for many years to come.
“Since the refurbishment, the station looks almost brand new – you would be forgiven for not realising it has been generating electricity for the area since 1927. Scotland has a long and proud history of hydroelectricity, and with this project Drax is ensuring these power stations play an important part in securing a net zero carbon future for our country.”
Drax acquired the Lanark hydro scheme
alongside the Galloway hydro scheme and the Cruachan pumped-hydro storage facility in Argyll in January 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, low carbon and renewable power generation.

Editor’s Notes
Prior to work starting at Stonebyres power station, it was scaffolded and wrapped in plastic to protect the building while the work was completed.
The replacement steel windows have been individually fabricated and fitted whilst the old paint on the outside of the building was removed using grit blasting before being washed down. A survey then identified areas for repair and all loose and damaged concrete was removed.
The paint used in the project is mineral based, and chemically bonds with the concrete to allow water to evaporate from the concrete.

Drax spokesperson comments on consultative ballot
9 June 2020
Press releases

“Stopping using coal is something Drax has been working on for well over a decade. The move away from coal is the right decision for the environment, our communities and our business. We have been talking to our employees and the unions for over two years about the impact coal closure will have on people, because we recognise this is going to be difficult for them and their families. We are consulting with trades unions and employee representatives on an enhanced redundancy package and support is being provided to those affected.
“We gave our employees over a year’s notice – the job losses will take place in April 2021. This means we have time to support those affected to get the best outcomes for them.
“Earlier this year, we announced that we’re talking to the government, trades unions and other industrial businesses in the North about setting up a Zero Carbon Skills Taskforce to help develop the skills needed to enable people in the North to take advantage of future opportunities beyond coal as we transition to a greener economy after the Covid crisis.”
Drax’s plans to develop ground-breaking bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) at the power station in North Yorkshire will help boost the UK’s economy following the Covid crisis and support the development of a
zero carbon industrial cluster
in the Humber region – delivering clean growth while protecting 55,000 jobs.

Virtual work experience launched at Britain’s biggest power station
8 June 2020
Press releases

Drax Power Station, in North Yorkshire, will offer virtual insight into the world of work as part of Drax Group’s continued support for STEM education.
Free online content hosted on Oak National Academy and developed by education experts.
Young people able to gain insight into working in the energy sector and other key industries.
Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, is Britain’s biggest power station and usually welcomes dozens of school pupils as part of work experience programmes throughout the year. Since the Covid-19 crisis began, Drax has suspended visitor access to the power station to protect employees who are key workers, playing a crucial role in generating the electricity the country needs.
The new initiative follows the launch of virtual tours at the power station. Each year the site plays host to 12,000 visitors, many of whom are students, visiting as part of Drax’s efforts to work with schools and colleges to promote Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) subjects.
The Careers & Enterprise Company and Oak National Academy have worked with Drax Group to create ‘My Week of Work’ which will run from June 8 to 12 and is aimed at inspiring and preparing young people for the world of work.
At a time when young people, schools and businesses face unprecedented challenges, the initiative aims to mobilise some of the country’s leading employers to help.
Drax has invested more than £
750,000 to support its customers and local communities during the Covid-19 crisis including donating 853 laptops to 50 schools and colleges across the country, including 412 to 20 schools across Yorkshire, Humberside and Lincolnshire helping to make sure children without access to computers or the internet at home are not left behind in their studies.
Drax Group’s head of sustainable business, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children from all backgrounds to study STEM subjects, so the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow.
“With students unable to visit the power station during the Covid-19 crisis it’s essential they don’t miss out on the opportunities businesses like Drax would usually provide.
“The virtual career week builds on the work we’ve already done to provide laptops, free internet access and virtual tours of the power station to ensure no students are left behind during the lockdown.
”
Schools pupils will gain insight from employees in five key economic sectors: health and social care, creative and digital, engineering and manufacturing, energy and renewables, and construction. They will be asked to investigate what Drax does as a company, what jobs can a young person do at a power station, how marketing works and gain hints and tips around recruitment processes and writing CVs or filling application forms.
The content is designed to be used either with the support of teachers, or by pupils independently. Though designed with year 9 and 10 pupils in mind, the content will be suitable for all secondary school students.
John Yarham, interim Chief Executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, said:
“The lockdown has helped people realise that schools do so much more than teach the curriculum. That includes helping them to prepare for life after school.
“We know that many schools, colleges, employers and careers guidance professionals are working incredibly hard to keep that support going despite the lockdown. We hope this partnership with Oak National Academy and many of the country’s leading employers can contribute to that amazing effort.”
Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills, Gillian Keegan said:
“It is fantastic to see so many leading businesses virtually opening their doors to young people across the country this week.
“Allowing young people to gain an insight into the workplace, to shape their career goals for the future and to prepare for the world of work is vital. I’d encourage all those who are interested to log on and explore the opportunities on offer”
Matt Hood, Principal of Oak National Academy, said:
“Work experience week is such a fun, important and enriching part of the school year for pupils in secondary school. We wanted to make sure they could still gain valuable insight into the world of work despite lockdown measures.
“We are thrilled to be working with The Careers & Enterprise Company and helping every young person up and down the country to connect with leading employers. We hope ‘My Week of Work’ will provide all young people with valuable life skills, experience and knowledge to take forward so they can lead successful lives after school.”
The Careers & Enterprise Company has also partnered with virtual learning platform Learn Live to host live Q&A sessions for young people with a further 27 leading employers during the week, including names such as Balfour Beatty, the Royal Air Force and HSBC.

Virtual tours of ‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station to support home learning
27 May 2020
Press releases

Drax Group has created the online resource to help schools continue to inspire students to study STEM subjects during the Covid19 lockdown
The initiative builds on Drax’s Laptops for Learners initiative, through which it has donated 853 laptops to 50 local schools and colleges across Great Britain
Drax Group has launched the free online resource for students to use from the comfort of their own homes as part of its efforts to support its communities during the lockdown.
Cruachan power station, in Argyll, is a unique pumped hydro storage plant located in the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  Using its reversible turbines, the station pumps water from Loch Awe to fill an upper reservoir on the mountainside at times when demand for electricity is low. This process allows the plant to act like a giant battery to store the water for when it is needed. When demand increases, the stored water can be released through the plant’s turbines to generate power quickly and reliably.
Each year the power station has 50,000 visitors, many of whom are students, visiting as part of Drax’s efforts to work with schools and colleges to promote Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) subjects.
Since the Covid-19 crisis began, Drax has suspended its public tours at the power station to protect employees who are key workers, playing a crucial role in generating the electricity the country needs as the lockdown continues.
To support its local communities Drax has donated 853 laptops to 50 schools and colleges across the country, including 182 to 17 schools and colleges across Scotland helping to make sure children without access to computers or the internet at home are not left behind in their studies.
Drax Group’s head of sustainable business, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children from all backgrounds to study STEM subjects, so the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow.
“With students having to be home-schooled during the Covid-19 crisis it’s essential they don’t miss out on the opportunities businesses like Drax would usually provide in creating positive experiences for them to support their studies.
“The virtual tours we’ve created builds on the work we’ve already done to provide laptops and free internet access, to ensure no students are left behind during the lockdown.”
Through its unique design, Cruachan can generate electricity in as little as 30 seconds when the grid needs it. The Hollow Mountain’s four generating units can provide enough flexible power for around 880,000 homes.
The power station is also a leading provider of support services and was
recently awarded a six-year stability contract
by National Grid to help keep Britain’s electricity system safe and secure.
Drax Group, the owner of the power station, recently announced a world-leading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 through pioneering new negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
The
virtual online tour
shows viewers how Cruachan operates like a giant battery and how power stations generate the electricity we all use in our everyday lives.

Drax Group was the first company in the world to announce an ambitions to become
carbon negative by 2030
.
Through using BECCS at scale around
16 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide could be captured at Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, a significant proportion of the negative emissions required for the UK to reach its zero carbon targets.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030.
Its 2,900-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
Customers:
Through its two B2B energy supply brands, Haven Power and Opus Energy, Drax supplies energy to 250,000 businesses across England, Scotland and Wales.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
