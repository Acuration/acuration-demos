december 2019 carbon capture over the past decade the united kingdom has decarbonised significantly as coal power has been replaced by sources like biomass wind and solar every year power generation emits fewer and fewer tonnes of carbon thanks to renewables and with the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars coming in no later than 2040 roads and urban areas are about to get cleaner too however there are still tough challenges ahead if the uk is to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050 aviation heavy industry agriculture shipping power generation  some of the key activities of daily economic life  all remain reliant on fuels that emit carbon this is where greenhouse gas removal ggr technologies have a big role to play these can capture carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and either store them or use them helping the drive towards carbon neutrality while the idea of being able to capture carbon has been around for some time the technology is fast catching up with the ambition there now exist a number of credible solutions that allow for capturing emissions the challenge however is putting in place the framework and policies needed to enable technologies to be implemented at scale time is short a recent report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis emphasised the need for government action now if we are to achieve the volume of carbon removal needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the tech to take emissions out of the atmosphere the planet naturally absorbs co 2  forests absorb it as they grow mangroves trap it in flooded soils and oceans absorb it from the air so harnessing this power through planting growing and actively managing forests is one natural method of ggr that can be easily implemented by policy aerial view of mangrove forest and river on the siargao island philippines the idea of using technology to capture co 2 and prevent its release into the atmosphere has been around since the 1970s it was first deployed successfully in enhanced oil recovery  when captured emissions are injected into underground oil reserves to help remove the oil from the ground over time its been developed and is now in place in a number of fossil fuel power stations around the world allowing them to cut emissions  however by combining the same technology with renewable fuels like compressed biomass wood pellets we can generate electricity that is carbon negative  each of these solutions operate in different ways but all are important vivid economics report emphasises that a range of different solutions will be required to reach a point where 130 million tonnes of co 2 mtco 2  are being removed from the atmosphere in the uk annually by 2050 however investment and clear government planning and guidance will be crucial in enabling the growth of grr the report estimates largescale ggr could cost around 13 billion per year by 2050 in the uk alone a figure similar in size to current government support for renewables if you went back 20odd years people were sceptical of the role of wind solar and biomass and whether the technologies would ever get to a cost point where they could be viably deployed at scale explains drax policy analyst richard gow in the last few years weve seen enormous cost reductions in renewables and people are far more confident in investing in them  that has been driven by very good government policy ggr needs the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  but what shape should those policies take for them to be effective options for policies perhaps the most straightforward route to enabling ggr is to build on existing policies for example there are existing tree planting schemes such as the woodland carbon fund woodland carbon code and the country stewardship scheme all of which could receive greater regulatory support or additional rules obliging emitters to invest in actively managed forests  more technically complex solutions like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs could be incentivised by alternative mechanisms in order to provide clarity on and to stabilise revenue streams these are already used to support companies building lowcarbon power generation such as through the contracts for difference scheme and have been effective in encouraging investment in projects with high upfront costs and longpayback periods alternative options to support the rollout of negative emissions technologies should also be considered for example the government could make it obligatory for companies that contribute to emissions to pay for ggr to avoid increased burden on electricity consumers in such a scenario fossil fuel suppliers would be required to offset the emissions of their products by buying negative emissions certificates from ggr providers as a result the price of fossil fuels for users would likely rise to cover this expense and the costs would then be shared across the supply chain rather than just a single party another approach that passes the costs of ggr deployment on to emitters is using emissions taxes to fund tax credits for ggr providers making these tax credits tradable would also mean any large taxpaying company such as a supermarket or bank could buy tax credits from ggr providers this approach would come at no cost to government as sales of the tax credits would be funded by an emissions tax and would offer revenue to ggr providers the challenge with tax credits however is they are vulnerable to changes in government an alternative is to offer direct grants and longterm contracts with ggr providers which would ensure funding for projects that transcends changes in parliament they could however prove costly for government whatever policy pathway the government may choose to follow there are underlying foundations needed to support effective ggr deployment making policies work there are still many unknown factors in ggr deployment such as the precise volume that will be needed to counter hardtoabate emissions this means all policy must be flexible to allow for future changes and the individual requirements of different regions forestbased solutions might suit some regions daccs might be better in others underlying the strength of any of these policies is the need for accurate carbon accounting understanding how much emissions are removed from the atmosphere by each technology will be key to reaching a true net zero status and giving credibility to certificates and tax credits pearl river nursery mississippi proper accounting of different technologies impact will also be crucial in delivering innovation grants these can come through the uks existing innovation structure and will be fundamental to jumpstarting the pilot programmes needed to test the viability of ggr approaches before commercialisation different approaches to ggr have different levels of effectiveness as well as different costs beccs for example serves two purposes in both generating lowcarbon power and capturing emissions  resulting in overall negative emissions across the supply chain its important to account for the full value chain of beccs explains gow therefore it should be rewarded through two mechanisms a cfd for the clean electricity produced and an incentive for the negative emissions a double policy here is important because you are providing two products which benefit different sectors of the economy one benefits power consumers and the other provides a service to society and the environment as a whole and cost should be apportioned as such beccs and daccs also have to consider wider supply chains such as carbon transport and storage infrastructure  although this requires a high initial investment by connecting to industrial emitters it can enable providers to recover the costs through charges to multiple network users ultimately the key to making any ggr policies work effectively and efficiently is speed in order to put in place accounting principles test different methods and begin courting investors government needs to act now the vivid economics report is further confirmation of the vital role that beccs will play in reaching a net zerocarbon economy and the need to deploy the uks first commercial project in the 2020s drax group ceo will gardiner says our successful beccs pilot is already capturing a tonne of carbon a day with the right policies in place drax could become the worlds first negative emissions power station and the anchor for a zero carbon economy in the humber region it will be significantly more cost efficient to begin deploying ggr in the next decade and slowly increase it up to the level of 130 mtco 2 per year than attempting to rapidly build infrastructure in the 2040s in a lastditch effort to meet carbon neutrality by 2050 read

executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags about us  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass energy  careers  decarbonisation  energy policy  gas  investors  sustainability laying down the pathway to carbon capture in a net zero uk will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 july 2019 opinion the starting gun has fired and the challenge is underway the government has officially set 2050 as the target year in which the uk will achieve carbon neutrality  theres no denying this economywide transformation will need a great deal of investment reaching net zero carbon emissions will require an evolutionary overhaul of not just great britains electricity system but the uk economy as a whole and indeed the way we live our lives and go about our business but that doesnt mean its out of reach instead it will fall to technologies such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to make it economical and possible the secret to making decarbonisation affordable the uks committee on climate change ccc estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1 of forecast gdp per annum in 2050 however the business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee inquiry found that failure to deploy ccus and beccs technology could double the cost to 2 there are a number of reasons for this such as the cost to jobs productivity and living standards of shutting down industrial emitters ccuss ability to contribute to a hydrogen economy can help avoid this moreover the ccc claims even with industries striving to decarbonise rapidly as much as 100 megatonnes of hardtoabate carbon dioxide co 2  is expected to remain in the uk economy by 2050 this makes carbon negative techniques and technologies  such as beccs  which uses woody biomass that has absorbed carbon in its lifetime as forests  alongside direct air capture dac the boosting of ocean plant productivity much greater tree planting and better sequestration of carbon in soil essential if the uk is to attain true carbon neutrality the importance of beccs and ccus in the zero carbon future is clear now is the time for rapid development not in 2030 not in 2040 but today in 2019 and into the 2020s but doing this requires the government to move beyond its historic policies that have failed to support the technology in the past progress needs longterm frameworks that provide private sector investors with the certainty they need to kickstart the commercialscale deployment of ccus technologies laying down the tracks to negative emissions for carbon capture to become an integrated part of the energy system it must deliver value well beyond the energy sector establishing markets for products developed from captured carbon will play a role here but to set the wheels in motion financial frameworks are needed that can allow beccs and ccus to thrive one device that can allow the market to develop ccus is the creation of contracts for difference cfds for carbon capture these currently exist in the lowcarbon generation space between generators and the governmentowned low carbon contracts company  lccc  through these contracts power generators are paid the difference between their cost of generating low carbon electricity known as a strike price and the price of electricity in great britains wholesale power market if the power price in the market is higher than the strike price generators pay the difference back to the lccc meaning consumers are protected from price spikes too it means that the generator is protected from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power offering the security to invest in new technology more than this cfds last many years meaning they transcend political cycles and the cost per megawatt can be reduced with a longer contract creating a market for carbon capture or negative emissions generation could offer the same security to generators to invest in the technology a cfd for beccs should not only incentivise the building of infrastructure to capture carbon but we must also recognise the valuable role that negative emissions can play by compensating beccs producers for their negative emissions it should provide a lower cost alternative to reducing all other co2 emissions to zero while still ensuring that the uk can get to net zero beyond installing carbon capture at existing generation sites one of the major financial barriers to the wider deployment of ccus and beccs is the cost and liability associated with transporting and storing captured carbon a regulated asset base rab funding model would encourage investment by gradually recovering the costs of transport and storage via a regulated return this approach is currently under consideration as a means of financing other major infrastructure projects  a rab allows businesses including investment and pension funds to invest in projects under the oversight of a government regulator in exchange for their commitment investors can collect a fee through regular consumer and nondomestic bills led by industry guided by government ultimately the current carbon trading system is based around charging polluters but as we approach a postcoal uk and in order to achieve net zero its necessary for this to evolve  from economically disincentivising emissions to incentivising carbonnegative power generation however with the cost of carbon capture and negative emissions differing between types of industries and technologies theres a requirement to consider differentiated carbon prices to guide industry through longterm strategy but the need for carbon capture development is too pressing for us as an industry to wait at drax power station our beccs pilot is just the beginning of our wider ambitions to become the first negative emissions power station our use of biomass already makes drax power station the largest generator of renewable electricity in great britain the responsiblymanaged working forests our suppliers source from absorbed carbon from the atmosphere as they grew so adding carbon capture at scale to this supply chain can turn our operation from low carbon to carbonneutral and eventually carbon negative and we have bigger plans still to create a net zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region  in partnership with equinor and national grid the cluster would deliver carbon capture at the scale needed to not just decarbonise the most carbonintensive industrial region in the uk but to put the country at the forefront of the decarbonisation of industry and manufacturing government action is needed to make ccus and beccs economically sustainable at scale as an integrated part of our energy system however the onus is on us the energy industry to lead development and act as trusted partners that can deliver

drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional

stress on securing a sustainable source of nutritious healthy food for future generations one uk startup deep branch biotechnology  is aiming to tackle both problems with a single solution that utilises captured co 2 emissions to create animal feed protein in the past drax has explored using co 2 captured from its biomass units to help prevent a looming summer beer shortage  now its partnering with deep branch to test if captured co 2 can solve some of agricultures mostpressing problems broken food chain the amount of land and resources dedicated to producing animal feed is increasingly unsustainable a third of all the earths cropland is currently used to grow feed crops for livestock  which adds up to more than 90 of all global soy and 60 of all cereals  soy seedlings the process of creating the protein we eat on our plates is extremely resource inefficient says peter rowe deep branch ceo it takes about 6 kilograms kg of feed to produce one kg of pork soy is one of the worlds most widely produced crops but more than 90 of it goes into animal feed its not just on land where feed crops are creating problems of fish caught around the world an incredible 25 is processed into fishmeal for the aquaculture  or fish farming industry the demand for fishmeal is such that at present it outpaces demand for fish even with an increasing number of people shifting to meatfree diets and more alternatives making headlines  meat production is still expected to double by 2050 these industries need serious overhauls if they are to sustain into the coming decades deep branch helped via funding from innovate uk  is looking to aquaculture as a test bed for sustainable protein production whilst also encouraging co 2 capture turning carbon to carp the secret behind deep branchs approach to turning emissions into fish food is a strain of bacteria that feeds on co 2  the partnership will see deep branch connect directly to a source of co 2  with the startup taking

enabling a process known as gas fermentation to take place download graphic high res no logo high res with logo normally when people think of fermentation they think about something like wine where sugar is converted into alcohol with a yeast acting as the biological catalyst says rowe our process however uses co 2 and hydrogen instead of sugar rather than yeast our proprietary bacterium acts as the biological catalyst and converts these gases into protein the resulting product is single cell protein which comes out as a milklike liquid when harvested its then dried into powder and 70 of what remains are proteins that can be used as a fishmeal replacement one of the advantages of deep branchs system is that rather than requiring energy to separate co 2  flue gas can be delivered directly to microbes which can convert up to 70 of the captured co 2 into proteins but for such a system to have a real impact it needs to be deployed at scale scaling up the process has been trialled in labs and proved highly efficient with ten kg of co 2 producing seven kg of protein what this new partnership with drax offers is the opportunity to test deep branchs process and technology at gridscale and while deep branch is focusing on aquaculture for now the concept could potentially reach much further through the food chain fish feed because draxs biomass units are carbon neutral at the point of generation the process creates an extremely lowcarbon protein explains rowe if you divorce the negative environmental impacts of industries like agriculture from its growth then you can provide more whilst impacting less deployed at global scale the idea of carbonneutral protein would free up some of the arable land currently being used for soy and other feed crops it means that as well as cutting the carbon intensity of traditional protein sources more land would be available for other uses while helping to halt climate change learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our

first carbon negative company tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  hydrogen  negative emissions capturing carbon emissions from the atmosphere could transform these industries 24 april 2019 carbon capture countries companies and industries around the world are racing to find ways to reduce their emissions but looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim negative emissions negative emissions technologies nets can actually absorb more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit and theyre vitally important for avoiding catastrophic manmade climate change without nets it could be impossible to achieve the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ambition of keeping temperatures under 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels one example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs it is what its name suggests using technologies to capture and store the co 2 generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere beccs holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry drax power station is currently piloting one form of this technology on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of co 2 a day but if it were deployed across all its biomass units beccs technology could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station beyond the power industry however theres scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably there are already five sites around the world where beccs is being trialled and implemented at scale laying the road to negative emissions storing co 2 from ethanol production in the illinois basin the ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of beccs including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world the illinois industrial carbon capture and storage project is part of a corntoethanol plant in the us that has the capacity to capture 1 million tonnes of co 2 every year  here corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygendeprived environment this process creates co 2 as a byproduct which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the illinois basin under the facility researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year norways cement challenge concrete is one of the worlds most versatile building materials as a result it is the second mostconsumed material in the world behind water  more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year however its key ingredient  cement which acts as concretes binding agent  is made using a hugely carbonintensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6 of all global carbon emissions the norcem cement plant in brevik southeast norway has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement which must heat ingredients to 1500 degrees celsius now its taking this a step further by becoming part of the countrys ambitious full chain ccs project the project will see 400000 tonnes of co 2 captured annually which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on norways western coast from here a pipeline will transport the co 2 50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the north seas bed the plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale the pipeline will be capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of co 2 per year  meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries burning waste and growing algae in a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial but combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions in japan however a biomassfired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions to get this project up and running toshiba the firm behind the project had to overcome unique challenges for example waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals than in ethanol or power production including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture now running at commercial scale the saga city waste incineration plant isnt just capturing co 2  its also utilising it to cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm  the carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products such as body and skin lotions carbon isnt the only thing finding new use at the facility reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 tokyo olympics the carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3000 tonnes of co 2 a year but it isnt the regions first deployments of beccs fully integrating beccs into biomass power nearby the mikawa power plant on the fukuoka prefecture is leading the race in asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station the 50 mw power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with toshiba at the time it was powered by coal however in 2017 the plant upgraded to a 100 biomass boiler fuelled by palm kernel shells  a waste product from palm oil extraction mills now its in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities with a target of being operational in 2020 the system  which after drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100 biomass feedstock  will have the capacity to capture more than 50 of the biomass plants co 2 emissions or as much as 180000 tonnes per year  japans government is now supporting efforts to develop co 2 transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year pulping wood and growing food beccs technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organicmatterbased industries but with many pulp and paper mills already using byproducts such as hog fuel  in generating power for their sites its a prime area for beccs growth in saintfelicien quebec commercialscale carbon capture technology is being deployed at a pulp mill run by resolute forest products and as of march 2019 had a capacity of capturing 11000 tonnes of co 2 a year rather than storage however it supplies the carbon to a cucumbergrowing greenhouse next door to the mill  as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25 of the greenhouses heating needs both long established biomassbased industries like ethanol and paper and new sectors like electricity are now adopting beccs technology and driving innovation the biomass feedstocks involved in beccs must however be sourced sustainably  or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere it should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way found a recent global biomass markets report from ricardo aea for the uks department for business energy and industrial strategy beis while its still a complex

capture cutting carbon emissions is the headline environmental policy for the 195 countries signed up to the paris climate agreement  and so it should be decarbonisation is crucial to keeping global warming below 2 o c and avoiding or at least mitigating potentially dire consequences for our planet its people and biodiversity however centuries of pumping out carbon dioxide co 2  from factories vehicles and power plants means its not enough just to reduce output countries must also work on co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere implemented at scale whats also known as greenhouse gas removal ggr could mean a country or facility removing more co 2 than it emits  effectively giving it negative emissions achieving this is not only advantageous to combating climate change its essential a new report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc explores 116 scenarios in which global warming is kept to 15 o c of preindustrial levels more ambitious than the paris agreements 2 o c of these scenarios 101 use negative emissions technologies nets at a scale of between 100 to 1000 gigatonnes  over the 21st century given the scale of the ambition the task of capturing enough carbon to be truly negative will need to rely on many sources here are some of the techniques technologies and innovations aiming to push the world towards negative emissions forests weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama cdr doesnt have to utilise complex tech and chemistry the planets natural carbon cycle already removes and stores huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere  primarily through trees the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global humangenerated co 2 emissions over the last few decades regenerating depleted forests reforestation planting new forests afforestation and protecting and helping existing forests thrive through active management can all contribute to offsetting emissions the ipcc report estimates that reforestations and afforestation could potentially capture 05 and 36 billion tonnes of co 2 a year at a cost of usd5 to 50 390 to 39 per metric tonne there are potential drawbacks of extensive afforestation it could compete with food crops as well as reducing the reflection of heat and light back into space that arid lands currently offer to prevent global warming bioenergy with carbon capture and storage europes first beccs pilot project at drax power station biomass on its own is an important fuel source in lowering emissions from industries such as power generation on one hand its created by organic material which during its lifetime absorbs carbon from the atmosphere often enough to offset emissions from transportation and combustion on another it creates a sustainable market for forestry products encouraging landowners to responsibly manage forests which in turn can lead to growing forests and increased co 2 absorption but when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs or ccus technology it becomes a negative carbon emissions process known as beccs drax is partnering with carbon capture company ccapture in a 400000 pilot to develop ccs technology which will remove a tonne of carbon from its operations a day combined with the carbon removed by the forests supplying the biomass it could turn drax into the worlds first negative emissions power station  beyond just storing the captured carbon underground however it can be used to create a range of products  locking in and making use of the carbon for much longer the ipcc report estimates between 05 and 5 billion metric tonnes of carbon could be captured globally this way at a cost of 100 to 200 80160 per metric tonne increased blue carbon mangrove roots its not only forests of fastgrowing pines or eucalyptus that remove co 2 from the atmosphere in fact coastal vegetation such as mangroves salt marshes and sea grasses suck in and store carbon in soil at a greater rate than plants on land  the carbon stored in these waterside ecosystems is known as blue carbon human encroachment and development on coastlines has depleted these environments however efforts are underway to regenerate and expand these hyperabsorbent ecosystems turning them into carbon sinks that can remove more emissions from the atmosphere than conventional forests apple is currently throwing its financial weight behind a mangrove expansion project in colombia to try and offset its global operations boosting ocean plants productivity beyond costal mangroves the ocean is full of plants that use co 2 to photosynthesise  in fact the oceans are thought to be one of the worlds largest carbon sinks but there are some people who think we could enhance marine plants absorption abilities eelgrass bed one such approach involves injecting iron nutrients into the ocean to prompt a bloom in microscopic plants called phytoplankton which float in the upper part of the ocean absorbing the co 2 absorbed from the atmosphere when the plants eventually die they then sink trapping the absorbed carbon on the seabed an additional positive effect would be an increase in dimethyl sulphide which marine plants emit this could alter the reflectivity of clouds that absorb water from the ocean and further act to cool the earth enhanced rock weathering plants absorbing co 2 through photosynthesis is the mostcommonly known part of the carbon cycle however rocks also absorb co 2 as they weather and erode the co 2 usually reaches the rock in the form of rain which absorbs co 2 from the atmosphere as it falls it then reacts with the rocks very slowly breaking them down and forming a bicarbonate that is eventually washed into the ocean locking the carbon on the seabed the problem is it takes a long time one idea that seeks to use this natural process more effectively is to speed it up by pulverising rocks and spreading the resulting powder over a larger area to absorb more co 2 from rain and air natural rock weathering currently absorbs around 03 of global fossil fuel emissions annually but the ipcc estimates at scale it could capture 2 and 4 billion metric tons at a cost of between 50 and 200 39160 per metric ton this approach also requires extensive land use and has not been trialled at scale sequestering carbon in soil soil is another major carbon sink plants and grasses that die and rot store carbon in the soil for long periods however modern farming techniques such as intensive ploughing and fertilisation causes carbon to be released and oxidised to form co 2  adjustments in farming methods could change this and at scale make agriculture carbon neutral  straightforward techniques such as minimising soil disturbance crop rotation and grassland regeneration could sequester as much as 5 billion tonnes of carbon into the soil annually according to the ipcc at potential zero cost a challenge to this method is that once soil is saturated it cant hold any more carbon that material would also be easily released if methods are not maintained in the future increasing soil carbon with biochar a way to supercharge how much carbon soil can store is to add a substance called biochar to the earth a type of charcoal made by burning biomass  such as wood or farm waste in the absence of oxygen biochar can increase the amount of carbon locked into the soil for hundreds or thousands of years it also helps soil retain water and reduce methane and nitrogen emissions biochar has only been trialled at a small scale but the ipcc estimates that between 05 and 2 billion metric tonnes could be captured annually through this means however it predicts a cost of between 30 and 120 2394 per metric tonne additionally producing biochar at scale would require large amounts of biomass that must be sustainably sourced direct air capture co 2 is in the air all around us and so removing it from the atmosphere can effectively take place anywhere direct air capture dac or daccs proposes that the carbon capture and storage technology many power stations are now trialling can be carried out almost anywhere direct air capture of co2 by a climaworks startup kezo involving garbage incineration in switzerland swiss startup climeworks is one company attempting to make dac viable  its technology works by passing air through a surface that reacts with co 2 to form a compound but releases the remaining air the newly formed compound is then heated so the reactive chemical agent can be separated and reused the co 2 is then stored underground with gas and water where it reacts with basalt and turns to stone in less than two years the main challenge for this technique is the cost  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne  and that it requires large amounts of energy creating further demand for electricity one hundred million tonnes wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the primary challenge for negative emission technology as a whole is that so few
