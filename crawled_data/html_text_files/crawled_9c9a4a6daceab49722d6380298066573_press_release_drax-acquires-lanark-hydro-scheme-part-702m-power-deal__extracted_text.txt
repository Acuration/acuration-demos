this hydro power system has operated on the clyde for over ninety years generating reliable supplies of electricity almost continuously powered by three waterfalls known collectively as the falls of clyde the lanark hydro scheme uses weirs to divert water from the river to generate electricity at the two power stations at stonebyres and bonnington the combination of hydro plants in scotland with draxs biomass units in yorkshire reinforces the companys position as great britains biggest generator of flexible and renewable electricity the scottish assets included in the deal are runofriver hydro locations at galloway and lanark 126mw cruachan pumped storage hydro 440mw in argyll and a biomassfromwaste facility daldowie near glasgow with the additional 2gw of gas power stations in england also acquired through the deal drax will be better placed to provide the flexibility and stability to help underpin more solar and wind power which will be needed in the decades to come if the
