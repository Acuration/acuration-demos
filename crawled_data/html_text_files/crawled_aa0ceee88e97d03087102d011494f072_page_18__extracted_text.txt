bechtel a world leader in engineering construction and project management has entered into a strategic partnership with renewable energy company drax to explore options and locations to construct new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs plants globally scaling up beccs sustainably over the coming decades will be critical to delivering the paris agreement climate targets and keeping the world on a pathway of limiting warming to 15 degrees the companies will also work together to identify how the design of a new build beccs plant can be optimised using the latest technology and best practice in engineering design bechtel has entered into a partnership with renewable energy company drax to identify opportunities to construct new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power plants around the world drax is the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted its power station near selby in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal by deploying beccs vital negative emissions technology drax aims to go further by becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 analysis by independent experts including the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change and international energy agency has identified that beccs and other technologies that can remove emissions from the atmosphere will need to be developed at a global scale over the coming years to limit climate change to 15 degrees of warming bechtel will focus its study on strategically important regions for new build beccs plants including north america and western europe as well as reviewing how to optimise the design of a beccs plant using stateoftheart engineering to maximise efficiency performance and cost jamie cochrane bechtel manager of energy transition said technological advancements have created new opportunities to improve how we bring power to communities worldwide we are resolved to work with our customers on projects that deliver effective ways to contribute to a clean energy future tackling the big global challenges related to climate change is key to meeting aggressive environmental targets and we are proud to partner with drax to optimise design and explore locations for the new generation of beccs facilities jason shipstone drax group chief innovation officer said negative emissions technologies such as beccs are crucial in tackling the global climate crisis and at drax were already planning to retrofit this to our uk power station demonstrating global climate leadership in the transformation of a former coalfired power station were interested in potential opportunities for exporting beccs overseas where drax could help other countries take positive action to address the climate crisis and meet the paris climate commitments by using innovative carbon capture technology to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere negative emissions technologies remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit and are widely accepted by the worlds leading authorities on climate change as being essential in the fight against climate change ends notes to editors bechtels study for drax will establish an integrated design for new build beccs power plants assess viability of strategic locations for new build plants provide strategic information to enable drax to build the business case about beccs at drax international organisations  such as the international energy agency  recognise that beccs is the most mature negative emissions technology they estimate that approximately 13 gtco2 of negative emissions from beccs is required globally every year to reach net zero drax aims to deploy beccs on two of its biomass generating units by 2030 capturing and permanently storing up to eight million tonnes of co 2 a year  a significant proportion of the 53mtco2 of negative emissions from beccs the uks independent climate change committee says are needed in order for the uk to reach its climate targets governments enhanced commitments to reduce emissions by 2035 and phase out coal alongside the unipcc and recent ieas reports also reinforce how net zero is only achievable through negative emissions and sustainable beccs beccs is the only negative emissions technology that generates power whilst also capturing and permanently storing carbon away media contacts mat ovenden manager

prepare for onceinadecade prolonged periods of little wind and reduced daylight report warns recent blackouts in texas show the danger of overlooking extreme weather risks britain needs more flexible and longerterm storage from pumped storage hydro not just batteries to plug the gap britains everchanging weather could put its landmark net zero climate target at risk and become a threat to the power grids security unless policymakers take action a new report has warned the independent report by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants shows the uk experienced its longest spell of low wind output in more than a decade during the first quarter of this year output from the countrys 244 gigawatt gw wind turbine fleet fell to as low as 06 gw on 3 march in sharp contrast to the 181 gw delivered later that month grid operators had to overwhelmingly call on gasfired units to generate power to plug the gap with the report finding every gigawatt of falling wind output being replaced by 084 gw of gas  harming britains carbon cutting ambitions periods of reduced generation from intermittent renewables cause strain on electricity systems with the phenomena recognised in germany as a dunkelflaute  a dark wind lull the event at the start of march was the longest dunkelflaute that britain has experienced in the last

report warns that britain could expect to face prolonged lowwind periods on average every 20 years making them a key challenge to the countrys energy security it says the recent widespread blackouts in the us state of texas highlights the cost of overlooking extreme weather risks to energy systems dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights report said its time for britain to get serious about the threat of extreme weather events to our electricity system renewable power sources have made our country cleaner and greener but as they rely on the everchanging british weather completing our transition away from fossil fuels comes with serious challenges dr malte jansen of imperial college london coauthor of the report added with wind and solar power set to supply half our electricity needs in the next five years these extreme events will become much more impactful to bridge the gap and deliver a net zero energy system the uk needs to invest in much more clean and flexible technologies such as long duration energy storage pumped storage hydro power stations act like giant water batteries storing excess energy when there is an oversupply of power and then releasing when the country needs it most despite being a key supporting pillar for intermittent generation from wind and solar power no new pumped storage plants have been built in britain since 1984 renewable energy leader drax group is progressing plans to develop a second underground power station at its existing cruachan pumped storage hydro plant in scotland drax group ceo will gardiner said a new generation of pumped storage hydro power stations will allow the uk decarbonise faster and cheaper drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload these water batteries soak up surplus power from wind and solar farms and then release it to plug gaps during extreme weather events innovative storage projects like draxs plans to expand cruachan are essential to delivering a net zero electricity system but we need the right investment framework from policymakers for it to become a reality the drax electric
