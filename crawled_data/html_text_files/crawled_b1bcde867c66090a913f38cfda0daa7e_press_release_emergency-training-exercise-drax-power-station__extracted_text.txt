emergency training exercise at drax power station around 100 emergency services staff from across yorkshire will put their skills to the test 29 september 2018 emergency services from yorkshire and humberside are working with the uks largest power station to test their combined capabilities in dealing with complex emergency incidents in the biggest training exercise of its kind at a power station in the region a training exercise will be staged at drax power station near selby in north yorkshire on saturday september 29 at 11am when emergency services staff will team up with power

responding to and managing very serious and complex incidents across the county well be practicing skills in tackling different kinds of fires working within unfamiliar industrial environments managing and minimising environmental hazards as well as rescuing casualties with a range of injuries  all of which is vital training so when it comes to saving real lives were as prepared as we can be andy koss drax power ceo said at drax we have an excellent safety record but as a responsible business and the operator of the uks biggest power station we want to do everything we can to reduce the likelihood of emergency incidents happening as well as minimising their impact should the worst happen creating this complex scenario in a live industrial setting like drax power station should make it more realistic for everyone involved so they get the most out of it the power station will be in operation as normal throughout the event people living nearby might see some smoke at around
