Tours and Events
Visit biomass, pumped storage and hydro power stations
The world needs electricity. But how many of us really know how it’s generated?
Come visit Drax Power Station
in Yorkshire or
Cruachan Power Station
in the Scottish Highlands and see with your own eyes!
Electricity is at the heart of everything we do. It powers our homes, our businesses, our schools and our hospitals. We use it every day, but how often do we stop and think how it’s produced? Believe us, it’s an amazing process.
It’s not just the power station that’s open to visitors. You’ll also be able to explore the
Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve
, to see local wildlife on a stunning reserve built and maintained by Drax.
Visits to our other businesses
across Drax Group, including our
hydropower stations
, are also available upon request.

Public tours of and visits to Drax Power Station are suspended for the rest of 2020. The suspensions are to reduce the risk to business-critical areas of our operation. We are planning to resume tours and visits early in 2021, but we cannot guarantee this at the present time. The closure of the Skylark Nature Reserve will separately be reviewed over the coming months.  For our visitor centres in Scotland we will be following the Scottish Government’s guidelines and will provide any updates in due course. Please check our website for the latest information and virtual tours.
