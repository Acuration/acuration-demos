for many years energy security was an issue resolved by complex continentwide gas pipelines which stretched from russia into the heart of europe we now know this reliance on russian gas didnt strengthen europes energy security  in fact it weakened it the uk is less reliant on foreign gas than many countries in europe in part due to the renewables revolution which has transformed our energy system over the last decade the rollout of biomass wind and solar power has enabled the uk to decarbonise its power grid at a faster rate than any other major economy and in order to reduce energy bills in the years ahead we need to have more clean green renewable power which is generated in the uk for the uk getting more green energy onto the grid can only be achieved through partnerships between government and private companies for businesses like drax that means having the right policies now to make largescale investment decisions for the future in vital green energy technologies like pumped storage hydro and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax has submitted planning applications for two major infrastructure projects designed to deliver both of these vital technologies in the 2020s they form part of a 3bn investment strategy which drax stands ready to implement this decade underlining the companys significant role as a growing global business at the heart of the green energy transition alongside strengthening the uks longterm energy security these projects will support thousands of jobs and provide a real opportunity for economic growth engineers at cruachan power station we aim to double the capacity of our cruachan pumped hydro storage facility in scotland supporting energy security and further decarbonisation of the grid at lower costs over the last two years due to bottlenecks on the transmission system and a lack of energy storage capacity enough wind power to supply 800000 homes each year with renewable electricity went to waste as household bills and global temperatures continue to rise we cant afford to let renewable power go to waste like this we need more storage to harness the wind power available now as well as the increased capacity being developed the coming years the only proven grid scale technology that can store vast quantities of energy for long durations is pumped storage hydro sites like cruachan act like giant water batteries using excess power from the grid to pump water to an upper reservoir where it is stored before rereleasing it to generate electricity while the uks policy and market support mechanisms have evolved to support new build renewables the current framework isnt suitable for pumped storage projects that can have a lifespan of many decades draxs plans would enable more homegrown renewable power to come online to strengthen the uks energy security and lower carbon emissions this additional capacity could be available within eight years to secure private investment in these projects get shovels in the ground and work underway developers need to know the policy environment they will be operating in abandoning or delaying net zero will not save the country money it will increase our reliance on foreign gas leaving households at the mercy of international markets which no uk government can control find out more about cruachan 2 here  in scotland alone there is more than 43 gw of storage projects in planning or awaiting construction  this is enough capacity to power around three million homes drax alongside the developers of some of these other projects has put forward plans for policies which would create the certainty needed to incentivise investment and kick start work to build the storage capacity this country needs for energy security these include introducing a cap and floor regime  the same support mechanism which was instrumental in the successful rollout of interconnectors in britain i urge the new conservative party leader to make the governments response to these proposals a priority as part of the package of measures needed to bolster the uks long term energy security and to bring the longerterm cost of energy down with the right policies to unlock investment the uk can lead the world in energy storage technologies which are urgently needed to keep the lights on cut carbon emissions and keep us on track to reach net zero this

july 2022 power generation key takeaways as the uk continues to expand its renewable capacity the cost of curtailing wind generation at times of low demand is increasing adding 806 million to bills over the last two years curtailment costs arise from the grid paying to turn down generation due to energy balancing or system balancing issues longduration storage such as pumped storage hydro offers a way to absorb excess wind power reducing the cost of keeping the system balanced draxs plans to expand cruachan power station would increase the amount of excess power it can absorb from 400 mw to over one gigawatt and rapidly deliver the same amount back to the grid when needed new financial mechanisms such as a cap and floor regime are needed to enable investors to back capitalintensive longterm projects that will save consumers and the grid millions meeting big ambitions takes big actions and therere few ambitions as big or as urgent as achieving a net zero power sector by 2035 this energy transition must mean more low carbon power sources and fewer fossil fuels but delivering that future requires new ways of managing power balancing the grid and a new generation of technologies innovation and thinking to make big projects a reality as the system evolves and more renewables particularly wind come online the uk is forecast to need 10 times more energy storage to deliver power when windlevels drop as well as absorb excess electricity when supply outstrips demand and to maintain grid stability pumped hydro storage offers a tried and tested solution but with no new longduration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the uk the challenges of bringing longterm projects to fruition are less engineering than they are financial draxs plan to expand cruachan power station to add as much as 600 megawatts mw of additional capacity will help support a renewable more affordable net zero electricity system but government action is needed to unlock a new generation of projects that deliver electricity storage at scale reigning in excess wind power wind is the keystone power source in the uks renewable ambitions wind capacity increased from 54 gw in 2010 to 257 gw in 2021  enough to provide renewable power for almost 20 million homes  and the government aims to increase this to 50 gw by 2030 however wind comes with challenges the volume of electricity being generated must always match the level of demand if there is a spike in electricity demand when there are low windlevels other technologies such as electricity storage or carbonemitting gas power are required to make up the shortfall conversely if there is too much wind power being generated and not enough demand for electricity the grid often has to pay windfarms to stop generating this is known as wind curtailment and its becoming more expensive growing from 300 million during 2020 to more than 500 million in 2021 an independent report by lane clark  peacock lcp by drax found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added 806 million to energy bills in britain there can also be a carbon cost to curtailing wind power as more intermittent renewables come onto the system the grid can become more unstable and difficult to balance in such an event the national grid is required to turn to fossil fuel plants like gas generation that can deliver balancing and ancillary services like inertia voltage control and reserve power that wind and solar cant provide its loselose for everyone says richard gow senior government policy manager at drax consumers are paying money to turn off wind and to turn up gas generation because therere not enough sources of ancillary services on the system or renewable power cant be delivered to where its needed curtailment costs have spiked this year because of gas prices and while they might dip in the next two or three years curtailment costs are only ever going to increase if theres wind power on the system without an increase in storage the cost of managing the system is only going to go up and up source the lcps renewable curtailment and the role of long duration storage report click to viewdownload here  the proposed cruachan 2 expansion would help the grid avoid paying to turn off wind farms by increasing the amount it would be able to absorb from 400 mw to over 1000 mw and rapidly deliver the same amount of zero carbon power back to the grid should wind levels suddenly drop or the grid need urgent balancing adding this kind of capability is a huge engineering project involving huge new underground caverns tunnels and waterways carved out of the rock below ben cruachan however the challenge in such a project lies less with the scale of the engineering than with its financeability from blueprints to real change the original cruachan power stations sixyear construction period began in 1959 the work of digging into the mountainside was carried out by a team of 1300 men known affectionately as the tunnel tigers  armed with hand drills and gelignite explosives in an era before modern health and safety practices engineer working at cruachan power station expanding cruachan in the 21 st century will be quite a different and safer process and one thats practically straightforward there is no reason why we physically couldnt build cruachan 2 says gow detailed engineering work has indicated that this is a very feasible project theres no technological reason or physical constraint that would prevent us it has a large upfront cost and requires drilling into a mountain but the challenge is much more on the financial particularly securing the investment side of the project pumped storage hydro facilities today generate their revenues from three different markets the capacity market where they receive a flat rate per kilowatt they deliver to the grid the wholesale and balancing market where they buy power to store when its abundant and cheap and sell it back to the grid when its needed more valuable and used to support the electricity system operator in matching supply and demand on a secondbysecond basis and through ancillary services contracts dedicated to specific stability services  these available markets present challenges for ambitious capitalintensive projects designed to operate at scale with the exception of the capacity market revenues from these markets are often volatile and difficult to forecast with no longterm contracts available sourcing the investment needed to build projects on the scale of cruachan 2 requires mechanisms to attract investors comfortable with long project development lead times that offer stable low risk rates of return in the longterm cap and floor an approach that can provide sufficient certainty to investors that income will cover the cost of debt and unlock finance for new projects is known as a cap and floor regime with cap and floor a facilitys revenues are subject to minimum and maximum levels if revenues are below the floor consumers would topup revenues while earnings above the cap would be returned to consumers this means investors can secure upfront funding safe in the knowledge of revenue certainty in the long term whilst also offering protection to consumers such an approach wont attract investors looking to make a fast buck but the vital role that it could play in the ongoing future of the uk energy system offers a longterm stable return at the same time the system would save both the grid and energy consumers hundreds of millions of pounds the cap and floor system is also not unique with a similar approach currently used for interconnectors  the submarine cables that physically connect the uks energy system to nearby countries allowing the uk to trade electricity with them this means investors are already familiar with cap and floor structures how they operate and what kind of returns they can expect its not just pumped storage hydro that this could apply to explains gow there are other different largescale longduration storage technologies that this could also apply to it would give us revenue certainty so that we can invest to support the system and reduce the cost of curtailment while ensuring consumers get value for their money the turbine hall inside cruachan power station cruachan was originally only made possible through the advocacy and actions of mp and wartime secretary of state for scotland tom johnston then it was needed to help absorb excess generation from the countrys new fleet of nuclear power stations and release this to meet short term spikes in demand today its renewable wind the system must adapt to for the uk to continue to meet an everchanging energy system the government must be prepared to act

that must be preserved cruachan pumped storage hydro station sits within ben cruachan and has operated for nearly 60years without damaging wildlife regular surveys and reporting allow drax to understand the health of different fauna and species over time its promising that even species of bird and insects that are declining in other parts of the uk are regularly spotted around cruachan the expansion of the power station has required and will continue to need careful assessment of the areas biodiversity to minimise any impact the project could cause the scottish highlands are home to some of the uks most stunning natural wonders from dramatic plunging lochs to the craggy ice capped munros the varied landscape holds some of the most biodiverse areas in the uk the regions fauna ranges from red deer to golden eagles while its flora includes the ancient oak and mosscovered forests that make up the temperate rainforest of the atlantic coast preserving these landscapes and the life that thrives in them is crucial to both the environment and economy of the region its the job of roddy davies health safety and environmental advisor at draxs cruachan power station to ensure operations at the site do not damage the natural environment this is a very biodiverse rich environment there are a lot of different species a large variety of natural habitats and plant life says davies its good that we can say weve operated here for nearly 60 years and all of that is still there its testament that we dont have a demonstrable negative effect on the wildlife that lives around us source blue leaf nature energy storage inside a mountain the pumped storage hydro station sits a kilometre inside ben cruachan a munro peak in the western highland region of argyll and bute its not an area you would normally associate with power generation but its perfect for pumped storage hydro the site has two bodies of water at differing elevations loch awe at the bottom and a reservoir at the top allowing cruachan to generate power when its needed as well as absorb electricity when there is an excess on the grid by pumping water back up the mountain storing it until power is needed and helping to keep the grid balanced the subterranean nature of the power station means the massive machinery including the four reversible turbines and the heat and noise they generate is hidden underground features on the surface are limited to a few buildings by the entrance tunnel at the banks of loch awe and the dam which contains the upper reservoir on the slopes of ben cruachan as well as several pylons and cables transporting electricity even the 316metre buttress dam takes the landscape into account when cruachan was built in the 50s and 60s the visual impact of it was very much in the minds of the people who built it and the authorities who approved it the dam is almost impossible to see from a public place explains davies our presence on the surface is very limited all the busy goingson are underground theres lots of noise underground but it doesnt travel outside ensuring that the area surrounding draxs operation continues to function without damaging the surrounding environment is an ongoing process davies deploys annual biodiversity surveys and reporting that gives drax over a decade of information and analysis to help identify trends the wildlife of ben cruachan the cruachan power station biodiversity survey for 2021 is the 11 th completed by blue leaf nature a biodiversity service provider the comprehensive report highlights the incredible diversity

the reports survey of invertebrates 150 different species were recorded in 2021 down from 170 in 2018 however its promising that among cruachans creepycrawlies are many that are in decline elsewhere in the uk with the numbers of some important insect types are increasing dragonfly and damselfly species for example increased from five in the previous survey to nine in 2021 moths and butterflies are particularly important to monitor as davies explains theyre a very strong indicator species for the health and quality of an ecosystem theyre also very sensitive to climatic changes and react quickly to temperature change source blue leaf nature in 2021 78 moth species were recorded around cruachan including one of butterfly conservations noted priority species yellowringed carpet as well as six species that feature on iucns red or amber lists there were 11 butterfly species recorded in 2021 including four priority species as well as two newly spotted species the small copper and the chequered skipper that species in decline around the country are increasingly thriving at cruachan is further testament to the power stations lack of disruption to the environment and as the uks electricity system continues to evolve and cruachan power station with it closely observing the surrounding environment and its inhabitants will become even more important expanding cruachan while preserving nature while cruachan first started generating and storing power in the 1960s its capabilities are becoming ever more critical as the national grid decarbonises and power generation becomes increasingly decentralised this is why drax is undertaking an ambitious project to expand cruachan cruachan 2 would add a further 600 mw of generation capacity to the plant for a total of 104 gw of power by providing stability services to the grid the expansion could enable an additional 300gigawatt hours of renewable power to come online source blue leaf nature the project is epic in scale new underground tunnels and subterranean caverns will house the reversible pumpturbines and will be carved out of the mountain vastly increasing the size of the power station but as with any activity in such a landscape careful planning is essential detailed surveys and assessments of the area are a key requirement for planning approval we need to acknowledge whats here and show that we understand what surveys have found says davies then we have to present our proposals for how we will protect them and mitigate any potential disturbance an advantage of pumped storage hydro is that much of the intensive excavating and construction work will take place underground with little disturbance on the surface cruachan 2 has the added benefit of utilising cruachans existing infrastructure for example it would not require flooding a valley to create a new upper reservoir ultimately cruachans half centuryplus of operation has not damaged or degraded the biodiversity of the western highlands

sustainability storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero 28 february 2022 electrification key points energy storage plays a crucial role in the uk electricity system by not only providing reserve power for when demand is high but also absorbing excess power when demand is low the uks electricity systems growing dependency on intermittent renewables means the amount of energy storage needed will increase to as much as 30 gw by 2050 there are three different durations of energy storage needed to help balance the grid shortterm daytoday and long term it will take a range of technologies including batteries pumped storage hydro and new approaches to meet the storage demands of a net zero grid when you turn on a lightbulb  in 10 20 or 30 years  the same thing will happen electricity will light up the room but where that electricity comes from will be different as the country moves toward net zero emissions  low carbon and renewable power sources will become the norm however its not as simple as swapping in renewables for the fossil fuels the grid was built around weather dependant sources like wind and solar are intermittent  meaning other sources are needed at times when theres little wind or no sunshine to meet the countrys electricity demand equally as challenging to manage however is what to do when theres an excess of power being generated at times of low demand energy storage offers a low carbon means of delivering power at times of low supply as well as absorbing any excess of generated power when demand is low helping to balance and stabilise the grid as the electricity system transforms through a range of lowcarbon and renewable technologies the amount of energy storage on the uk grid will need to expand from 3 gw of today to over 30 gw in the coming decades  the storage solution even as the uks electricity system transforms from fossil fuels to renewables the way the grid operates remains primarily the same central to that is the principle that the supply of electricity being generated must always match the demand on a secondbysecond basis too little or too much power on the system can cause power outages and damage equipment national grid needs to be able to call on reserve power sources to meet demand when supply is low or pay to curtail renewable sources output when demand drops during the summer of 2020 for example lower demand due to covid19 coupled with high renewable output resulted in balancing costs 40 above expectations  there is a lot of offshore wind coming online in scotland as much as 11 gw by 2030 and a further 25 gw planned explains steve marshall a development manager at drax offshore wind farm along the coast of scotland its great because it increases the amount of renewable power on the system but the transmission lines between scotland and england can become saturated as much as 3040 of the time because there is too much power electricity storage can provide a source of reserve power as well as absorb excess electricity these capabilities are crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring that frequency remains within a stable operating range of 50 hertz as well as providing other ancillary services  whether its absorbing power or delivering electricity needed to keep the grid stable in energy storage timing is everything  there are three main time periods electricity storage needs to operate over fastacting short term electricity because electricity supply must always match demand sudden changes mean the grid needs to respond immediately to ensure frequency and voltage remain stable and electricity safe to use batteries are considered the fastest technology for responding to a sudden spike in demand or an abrupt loss of supply battery technology has evolved rapidly in recent decades as innovations like lithiumion batteries such as those used in electric cars and emerging solidstate batteries become more affordable and more commonplace this makes it more feasible to deploy largescale installations that can absorb and store excess power from the grid batteries are good for nearinstantaneous responses it can be a matter of milliseconds for a battery to deploy power says marshall if theres a sudden problem with frequency or voltage batteries can respond  its something thats quite unique to them the speed at which batteries can deploy and absorb electricity makes them useful grid assets however even very large battery setups can only discharge power for around two hours if for example the wind dropped off for a long period the grid needs a longerduration supply of stored power powering daytoday changes in supply demand and the grid when it comes to managing the daily variations of supply and demand the grid needs to be able to call on reserves of power for when there are unexpected changes in the weather or electricity demand from users pumped storage hydro power offers a low carbon way to provide huge amounts of electricity quickly and for periods that can last as long as eight or even 24 hours the technology works by moving water between two reservoirs of water at different elevations when there is demand for electricity water is released from the upper reservoir which rushes down a series of pipes spinning water turbines generating electricity however when there is an excess of power on the electricity system the same turbines can reverse and absorb electricity to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir storing it there as a massive water battery pumped storage hydro is a longestablished technology having been developed since the 1890s in italy and switzerland in the uk today there are four pumped storage hydro power stations in scotland and wales with a total capacity of 28 gw among those is the draxowned cruachan power station in the scottish highlands the plant is made up of four generatingpumping turbines located inside ben cruachan between loch awe and an upper reservoir holding 10 million cubic metres of water turbine hall at cruachan power station pumped hydro storage facilities can rapidly begin generating large volumes of power in as little as 30 seconds or less the ability to switch their turbines between different modes  pump generate and spin mode to provide inertia to the gird without producing power  make pumped storage hydro plants versatile assets for the gird how cruachan operates depends on weather says marshall we make as many 1000 mode changes a month thats how frequently cruachan is called on by national grid as the electricity system transforms there will be a greater need for flexible energy storage like pumped storage hydro this is why drax is kickstarting plans to expand cruachan power station however the specific conditions needed for such facilities can make new projects difficult and expensive cruachan 2 to the east of the original power station will add up to 600 mw in generating capacity  more than doubling the sites total capacity to more than 1gw by increasing the number of turbines operating at the facility it increases the range of services that the grid can call upon from the site longterm electricity solutions however storage technologies as they exist today cannot alone offer all the solutions the uk will need to achieve its net zero targets while technologies like pumped storage can generate for the better part of a day longer periods of unfavourable conditions for renewables will need new approaches in march 2021 for example the uk experienced its longest cold and calm spell in more than a decade with wind farms operating at just 11 of their capacity for 11 days straight  according to electric insights the shortfall in the countrys primary source of renewable power was made up for by gas power stations but in a net zero future such responses will only be feasible if theyre part of carbon capture and storage systems or replaced by other carbon neutral or energy storage solutions generating enough power to supply an electrified future as well as being able to take pressure off the grid and provide balancing services will require a range of technologies working in tandem over extended periods interconnectors with neighbouring countries for example can work alongside storage solutions to shed excess power to where there is greater demand similarly rather than curtailing wind or solar power extra electricity could be used for electrolysis to produce hydrogen  other functions may include demand side response where heavy power users are incentivised to reduce their electricity usage during peak periods helping to reduce demand to achieve stable reliable net zero electricity systems the uk needs to act now to not only replace fossil fuels with renewables but put the essential energy storage and balancing solutions in place that means electricity is there when you turn on a lightbulb tags battery energy storage  cruachan  cruachan power station  energy policy  energy storage  hydroelectric power expanding cruachan an epic energy storage project to help unlock a renewable future 12 january 2022 power generation at the beginning of march 2021 britain experienced its longest wind drought in a decade for eleven days wind output averaged just 11 of the uk electricity mix  less than a quarter of the average output in the month before and the month after the power system was able to cope as gas power stations made up most of the shortfall but keeping the lights on will become increasingly challenging as electricity generation shifts from carbonintensive coal and gas towards weatherdependent wind and solar technologies where supply is variable and intermittent one solution to maintain a stable resilient power supply as the electricity system decarbonises is increasing the amount of longduration energy storage that can plug gaps and balance the gird  pumped hydro storage  a tried and tested solution the largestcapacity form of electricity storage by far  pumped storage hydro plays a key role in the energy mix and stabilising the grid which is why following a feasibility study drax has kickstarted plans to extend our pumped hydro storage power station at cruachan in the scottish highlands by drilling a second cavern inside ben cruachan cruachan 2  to the east of the original power station will add up to 600 mw in generating capacity more than doubling the sites total capacity to more than 1gw its an epic project and one that could provide power for around a million homes the original cruachan facility has been supplying and absorbing excess power to the grid since 1965 acting as a green battery it stores lowcarbon energy when there is over supply and releases it when demand is high designed at a time when the grid was powered by nuclear or coalfired plants that could only adjust output slowly cruachans technology is still cutting edge and has proved equally successful at balancing more volatile supply and demand as power generation has shifted towards renewables and lowcarbon sources cruachan plays a critical role in the uk energy system today because it provides a unique range of services for a single asset  it can both generate electricity at 440 mw but it can also pump which means it takes that power off the system so in effect you can deploy greater renewable resources and if theres too much wind in the system rather than curtail wind farms you can pump to take 482 mw off the system says steve marshall development manager at cruachan 2 pumped storage hydro psh at cruachan power station click to viewdownload enabling more renewables on the system as marshall points out too much wind can be as problematic as too little with the governments ambition to quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to 40 gigawatts gw the grid will have to manage significantly more windgenerated power and consequently much greater fluctuations in supply currently the demand left to be met by renewable generation ranges from 10 gw to 30 gw throughout the year but modelling by imperial college london suggests that with 40 gw of offshore wind this range could expand from 30 gw right down to minus 30 gw in other words renewables would produce significantly more than national demand without longterm storage capacity this energy will be wasted forcing the grid to pay wind farms to stop generating theres a lot of offshore wind coming online in scotland that has to be transported through the transmission system to england where the demand is says marshall the transmission system in 2030 could become saturated more than 2030 of the time because theres too much renewable power you have a choice either build more transmission lines or more energy storage that can take that power off the system turbine hall at cruachan power station plugging the inertia gap as well integrating more renewables into the electricity mix the cruachan expansion may also help meet the inertia shortfall  inertia  stored kinetic energy  acts as a shock absorber in the system smoothing out sudden changes in power supply and demand and ensuring that frequency remains stable at 50 hz this is a critical as just 1 variation above or below this standard can damage equipment and infrastructure many renewable technologies such as wind turbines and solar pv panels arent built around spinning turbines that synchronise with the grid and so lack inherent inertia cruachans turbines on the other hand spin at 500600rpm and produce electricity at the grid frequency of 50 hz providing inertia that helps the grid remain stable indeed in 2020 national grid eso contracted a unit at cruachan to provide inertia 247 as part of a 6 year contract the grid calls on cruachan three to four hundred times a month with generation mode changes ranging from hours to very short bursts explains marshall increasing the number of turbines would allow cruachan to respond to a greater range of the grids needs  with more units you have more flexibility says marshall if you start to change the generating unit sizes to 150 mw or 200mw machines you get different levels of inertia that offers more options to the grid building on cruachans legacy while automated drilling processes mean that the rock will no longer need to be excavated by tunnel tigers  the crews that handdrilled blasted and excavated granite from the mountainside cruachan 2 will still create an estimated 300 jobs during peak construction and support around 900 jobs across the country and by bringing around 300 gw a year of renewable energy to the grid and reducing requirement for further transmission lines the expansion has the potential to save consumers more than 350 million in energy costs by 2050 with the increased deployment of renewables there is a need for more assets like cruachan says marshall the ambition is to have cruachan 2 operational by 2030 and work could start as early as 2024 but progress is dependent on the government providing support through a revenue stabilisation mechanism for such a longterm largescale energy storage project a study by kpmg found that a cap and floor regime similar to what has unlocked a wave of investment in crossborder interconnectors could be the best mechanism for longduration storage if this is forthcoming the expansion could play a vital role in stabilising the grid and smoothing the uks transition to a net zero power system tags cruachan  cruachan power station  decarbonisation  hydroelectric power pumped storage hydro why its key to a renewable future will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 3 july 2021 opinion in brief pumped storage hydro psh can provide the largescale power storage that a grid increasingly dominated by wind and solar needs drax owns and operates cruachan power station one of the countrys longest serving psh plants we are now progressing plans to increase its generation capacity by 600 mw to a total of 104gw this expansion project  called cruachan 2  would help enable greater deployment of renewables to the grid approximately 300 gwh a year deliver cumulative savings of more than 350 million for consumers and support 900 green jobs our community consultation for cruachan 2 is open until 23 july please share your view  cruachan 2 could be operational by 2030 but for it to materialise we need the uk government to commit to creating a route to market for this technology as well as continued support from the scottish government great britain has made incredible advances in wind and solar over the last decade in fact the prime minister has laid out ambitious plans to power every uk home by offshore wind by 2030 this is a bold and necessary step but we must be cognisant of the nature of the power that wind and solar bring to the grid unlike the fossil fuels on which the grid was built  intermittent power sources  such as wind or solar  only generate electricity when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining and turning them off when they are generating too much power is wasteful a grid overly reliant on these sources can fall victim to unfavourable weather conditions leading to too little power generation and the risk of blackouts  grid scale flexibility and long duration energy storage technologies can address this as they are able to preserve excess power when generation is peaking and then release it back on to the grid when demand rises the problem is how do you create storage large enough to operate at grid scale and how do you deploy that at a speed quick enough to meet sudden changes in demand we believe pumped storage hydro psh is an essential component of a decarbonised reliable electricity grid the country is at a point where it needs more psh to take the next step forward in its journey to a net zero economy  at drax we are poised to help deliver it we now need the support and stability of technologies like pumped storage hydro to ensure our grid is not only greener but stable affordable and flexible looking at scotland specifically its emissions reduction targets its 2045 commitment for net zero and the challenges facing the scottish government today are very different to those it faced just a decade ago we entered a new era for climate action in scotland at the beginning of the 2020s the challenge for the next decade is to accelerate the decarbonisation of other sectors of the economy much of it via electrification and to increase flexibility in the power system to help meet the challenge of operating large amounts of intermittent renewable power the power of pumped storage hydro psh works like this  in times of surplus electricity supply for example when weather allows for high volumes of wind and solar it uses excess grid electricity to pump water up into high altitude reservoirs then in times of high demand but low generation that water is released back downhill powering turbines that generate electricity as it goes pumped storage hydro psh at cruachan power station at ben cruachan in argyll scotland drax already operates one of the largest psh facilities in the uk built in the mid 1960s cruachan power station has a capacity of 440 megawatts mw and is able to power a city for 16 hours how do you create energy storage large enough to operate at grid scale and how do you deploy it at a speed quick enough to meet sudden changes in demand for more than 55 years it has been an integral part of supporting the countrys grid but it could do more thats why were planning an expansion which we call cruachan 2  a project that would add another 600 mw of pumping and generation capacity to the plant for a total of 104 gw of power engineer within cruachan power station this would not only support the uks renewable strategy but enable more wind and solar onto the grid and deliver cumulative savings of more than 350 million to consumers as the network continues to decarbonise and on top of storage provision the construction and operation of cruachan 2 would directly create 300 jobs over the fivetosixyear construction period and support a total of nearly 900 jobs across the region  not to mention provide a range of ancillary grid services such as inertia that help will keep the network stable were progressing plans to have cruachan 2 operational by 2030 but success will rely on the right policies and commitments from government to instil investor confidence by reducing risk the policy needed to support pumped storage hydro as highlighted in a recent report by the renewable energy association energy market mechanisms that were introduced to support low carbon and renewable generation such as contracts for difference and the capacity market are not able to support projects like cruachan 2 which come with significant upfront costs and long build times however if the government were to investigate the possibility of introducing alternative mechanisms to support longduration largescale energy storage technologies similar to those used to enable interconnectors it could pave the way for psh to play a powerful supporting role in creating a greener cleaner uk where climate and economic sustainability go hand in hand renewables are essential to the uk reaching net zero and the work that has been done to increase their capacity on the countrys grid is testament to the governments ambition but we now need the support and stability of technologies like psh to ensure our grid is not only greener but stable affordable and flexible go deeper find out more about cruachan 2 and take part in our community consultation  tags cruachan power station  energy storage  hydroelectric power what is pumped storage hydro 22 june 2021 power generation what is pumped storage hydro pumped storage hydro psh is a largescale method of storing energy that can be converted into hydroelectric power the longduration storage technology has been used for more than half a century to balance demand on great britains electricity grid and accounts for more than 99 of bulk energy storage capacity worldwide how does it work the principle is simple pumped storage facilities have two water reservoirs at different elevations on a steep slope when there is excess power on the grid and demand for electricity is low the power is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir using reversible turbines when demand is high the water is released downhill into the lower reservoir driving the turbines the other direction to generate electricity pumped storage hydro plants can also provide ancillary services to help balance the power system such as inertia from spinning turbines  which ensures the system runs at the right frequency and reduces the risk of power cuts why is pumped storage hydro important for energy transition governments around the world are shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to meet their climate goals but critically important power technologies such as wind and solar pose challenges for power grid operators being weatherdependent the supply from these renewables is intermittent for example wind farms accounted for almost a quarter of the uks total electricity generation in 2020  but on some days less than 10 of the countrys electricity needs were met by wind changing weather patterns and extreme weather events with prolonged periods of little wind or reduced daylight are a further the threat to grid stability when output from renewables falls grid operators mostly turn to gasfired power stations to plug the gap but relying on fossil fuels such as natural gas in the long term to balance the grid will compromise efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050 pumped storage hydro facilities act as vast water batteries they are a flexible way of storing excess energy generated by renewables costeffectively and at scale how can pumped storage hydro capacity be increased as old thermal power plants are decommissioned and renewables provide an increasing share of the electricity supply storage capacity will need to grow if climate goals are to be met over the next two to three decades great britains energy storage capacity alone will need to increase tenfold from 3 gigawatts gw to around 30 gw pumped storage hydro power stations require very specific sites  with substantial bodies of water between different elevations there are hundreds if not thousands of potential sites around the uk including disused mines quarries and underground caverns but the cost of developing entirely new facilities is huge a more costeffective way to increase storage capacity is by expanding existing plants  such as the cruachan power station in scotland  pumped storage hydro fast facts pumped storage hydroelectric projects have been providing energy storage capacity in italy and switzerland since the 1890s  the uk has four pumped storage hydro power stations in scotland

than just replacing coal power stations with wind farms moving to an energy system with more intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar will require greater levels of storage that can deliver electricity when its needed one of the longestablished means of storing energy and using it to generate electricity when needed is through pumped hydropower storage with upper and lower reservoirs of water and turbines in between these facilities act a bit like rechargeable batteries when there is excess electricity on the grid the turbines are switched on to pump water from the lower to the higher reservoir for example up a mountain or hill where its stored when electricity is needed the water is released to flow from the higher reservoir toward the lower reservoir passing through the turbines which generate electricity to send back to the grid greater levels of intermittent renewables on energy systems around the world will make pumped storage all the more vital in helping to balance grids their mountainous locations also make pumped storage stations some of the most dramatic and interesting monuments in energy here are some of the most interesting pumped hydro stations generating power and pumping water up mountains in the world 1 the largest in the world currently bath county in virginia usa is dense with forests and mountain retreats but below the scenery of the allegheny mountains lies the worlds biggest pumped hydro power station view of appalachian mountains along highway 220 in warm springs bath county virginia the bath county pumped storage station has a maximum generation capacity of more than 3 gigawatts gw and total storage capacity of 24 gigawatthours gwh the equivalent to the total yearly electricity use of about 6000 homes  construction began in march 1977 and upon completion in december 1985 the power station had a generating capacity of 21 gw however its six turbines were upgraded between 2004 and 2009 to over 500 mw per turbine the power stations upper reservoir can hold 14000000 cubic metres m 3  of water and its water level can drop by as much as 32 metres during operations while the amount of earth and rock moved during the construction of the dam and facilities would make a mountain more than 300 metres tall the actual station occupies a relatively small amount of land to minimise its impact on the environment the water from the upper reservoir has a use beyond power too  at times of drought its used to supplement river flow in the recreational area that surrounds the site 2 the future largest in the world bath county will not be the worlds largest pumped hydro station for much longer while china is already home to more of the top 10 largest pumped storage power stations than any other country the fengning pumped storage power plant in chinas hebei province will take the top position when completed in 2023 thanks to its 36 gw capacity landscape of the bashang grassland in hebei china construction first began on the monster project in june 2013 and is being developed in two 18 gw stages the first stage is scheduled for completion in 2021 when six of the 12 planned 300 mw reversable pump turbine units

wind and solar parks in chinas northern hebei and inner mongolia regions china has more installed pumped hydro storage capacity than any other country thanks in large part to its extensive mountainous terrain which can accommodate such facilities as well as an increasing need to support growing intermittent renewable installations the construction of fengning part of a pipeline of projects will further the countrys capabilities helping china reach as much as 40 gw of installed capacity in the coming years 3 most reversable turbines fengning will also take the record for the most individual turbine units in a pumped storage facility when its finished in 2023 a title that is currently jointly held by huizhou pumped storage power station and guangdong pumped storage power station  these two plants are the respective second and third largest pumped storage plants in the world today each with eight reversable turbines guangzhou city guangdong province china while guangdong pumped storage power station has a capacity of 24 gw huizhou has a slightly larger capacity of 2448 gw the increased number of turbines might mean more machinery to maintain and operate but also offers the plants greater flexibility in how much electricity they absorb and generate 4 multiple dams and reservoirs the drakensberg pumped storage scheme  located in the drakensberg mountains in the province of kwazulunatal south africa is a unique hydro facility thanks to its use of four dams the driekloof dam sterkfontein dam kilburn dam and woodstock dam give the facility a generation capacity of 1 gw and a total storage capacity of over 27 gwh however drakensberg is not the largest facility in south africa drakensberg mountains in south africa south africa holds a total installed pumped storage capacity of nearly 3 gw from its four large facilities the newest and largest is the ingula pumped storage scheme  which has a generation capacity of over 13 gw its name ingula was inspired by the foamy river waters surrounding the facility and comes from the zulu word for the creamy foam on the top of a milk vessel 5 the oldest working pumped storage plant another country with the ideal terrain for pumped storage is switzerland the alpine countrys landscape feeds water into europes rivers such as the rhine making water a plentiful supply for the countrys energy hydropower as a whole accounts for around 57 of the countrys energy production and the country was one of the first to begin deploying pumped storage systems in the 1890s although these were initially used for water management rather than supporting electricity generation water dam and reservoir lake in swiss alps to produce hydropower switzerland is also home to the worlds oldest working pumped storage plant the engeweiher pumped storage facility was built in 1907 before reversable turbines were introduced in the 1930s it was renewed in the early 1990s and is scheduled to continue operating until at least 2052 6 the biggest in europe the alps are also home to europes biggest hydroelectric facility in france the grand maison hydroelectric power station operates in the isère area of the auvergnerhônealpes region and has a capacity of 18 gw during peak demand it takes only three minutes for the station to supply its full 18 gw of power to the national electricity grid of france grand maison hydroelectric power station sitting at an altitude of 1698 metres the majority of the water that fills the upper reservoir created by the grand maison dam comes from melted snow this reservoir

generation since 1879 the uk has a total hydropower capacity of over 47 gw including 28 gw of pumped storage  with the wet mountainous landscapes of scottish highlands and welsh countryside particularly well suited to hydropower facilities dinorwig hydroelectric power station the largest of these is the dinorwig hydro power station which sits at the edge of snowdonia national park in north west wales although its hard to spot as most of the machinery is found underground with a total capacity of over 17 gw this pumped storage plant can power 25 million homes and is known by locals as electric mountain 8 the station lying between the lochs surrounded by loch etive and loch nant and perched on the north side of loch awe draxs cruachan power station was built between 1959 and 1965 1 km inside of a hollowedout mountain in argyll and bute scotland upon completion the power station also known as the hollow mountain was opened by queen elizabeth ii and can currently generate 440 mw
