biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 18 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also
