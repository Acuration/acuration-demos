Supporting university education
At Drax, our commitment to education aligns with our purpose – to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future – and our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030.
We supply renewable power and energy services to customers within the education sector, while also offering STEM-based learning resources and educational tours of our power generation sites.
We also provide job placements, internships, apprenticeships and graduate opportunities – as well as careers support and guidance.

Why Drax
We believe in developing the skills and talents of our staff, and so we make opportunities for training a high priority for everyone. That means everyone gets the chance to shape their careers in the way they want to progress and to contribute to our continued success.
As well as providing numerous possibilities to enhance your career, we also offer several additional benefits to our employees, such as bonus and a quality pension scheme.
Helping with learning
We work with schools, colleges and universities near our sites (and beyond) to provide the practical and financial support that’s needed.
During the COVID lockdowns, we invested £200,000 in almost 700 laptops and donated them to partner schools to ensure students in England and Scotland could stay connected.
In partnership with Selby College (by Drax Power Station), we secured a £272k government grant to develop the UK’s first educational programmes about carbon capture. Colleagues attending will learn how to operate our bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
As well as this, we recently launched the
Drax Foundation
, a key part of our commitment to deliver a positive impact in the communities where we operate – the UK, US and Canada. The Foundation will fund initiatives that support education and skills development in STEM, and will also enhance biodiversity and green spaces in local communities.
