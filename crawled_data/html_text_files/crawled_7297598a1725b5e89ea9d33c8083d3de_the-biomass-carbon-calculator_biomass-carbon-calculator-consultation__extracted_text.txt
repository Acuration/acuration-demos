consultation drax is committed to taking a leading role in the lifecycle emission reporting of biomass we aim to deliver transparent and accurate reporting of our own supply chain emissions and wish to encourage and facilitate improved reporting across the industry as a contribution towards these objectives drax has developed the biomass carbon calculator  the calculator is a greenhouse gas lifecycle emission tool that allows accurate calculation and transparent reporting of wood pellet supply chain ghg emissions in accordance with uk and eu regulations to ensure the tool meets all necessary regulatory requirements and provides a high industry standard for emissions reporting we held an open consultation on the calculator running from 1 st may to 12 th june 2020 drax thanks all respondents for participating in the consultation we received five formal responses from a range of stakeholders including regulators nongovernment organisations and industry in addition we received informal feedback from a variety of other stakeholders including our suppliers and the united nations economic commission for europe unece team of specialists on wood energy 1  we have considered all feedback and published an updated version of the calculator and accompanying user guide alongside a summary of responses on 10112020  following these updates the calculator was independently verified
