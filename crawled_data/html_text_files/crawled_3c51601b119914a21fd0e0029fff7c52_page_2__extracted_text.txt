has been using effective postharvest evaluations which includes remote sensing technology and satellite imagery alongside sustainable forest management monitoring can help support rapid regrowth after harvesting evidence shows healthy managed forests with no signs of deforestation or degradation as part of draxs worldleading programme of demonstrating biomass sustainability including ongoing work on catchment area analysis caa  responsible sourcing policy and healthy forest landscapes hfl  we have also been trialling the use of highresolution satellite imagery to monitor forest conditions on specific harvesting sites in the years after harvesting has taken place in addition to the catchment area level monitoring of trends and data postharvest evaluations phe are an essential part of an ongoing sustainability monitoring process ensuring that the future forest resource is protected and maintained and that landowners restore forests after harvesting to prevent deforestation or degradation the most effective form of phe is for an experienced local forester to walk and survey the harvesting site to check that new trees are growing and that the health and quality of the young replacement forest is maintained rapid regrowth the images below show some of the sites surrounding draxs amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi with trees at various stages of regrowth in the years after harvesting newly planted pine pine 23 years pine 612 months pine 45 years a full site inspection can therefore enable a forester to determine whether the quantity and distribution of healthy trees is sufficient to make a productive forest equivalent to the area that was harvested it can also identify if there are any health problems pest damage or management issues such as weed growth or waterlogging that should be resolved typically this will be the responsibility of the forest owner or their forest manager and is a regular part of ongoing forest management activity this degree of survey and assessment is not practical or costeffective where a thirdparty consumer of wood fibre purchases a small proportion typically 2025 tonnes per acre of the lowgrade fibre produced at a harvest as a oneoff transaction for its wood pellet plant it is time consuming to walk every acre of restocked forest and it is not always possible to get an owners permission to access their land forests from space therefore an alternative methodology is required to make an assessment about the condition of forest lands that have been harvested to supply biomass without the need to physically inspect each site one option is to use remote sensing and satellite imagery to view each harvested site in the years after biomass sourcing this helps to monitor restocking and new tree growth drax has been testing the remote sensing approach using maxars commercial satellite imagery maxar has four satellites on orbit that collect more than three million square kilometres of highresolution imagery every day drax accesses this imagery through maxars subscription service securewatch  to test the viability of this methodology drax has been looking at harvesting sites in mississippi that supplied biomass to the amite bioenergy pellet plant in 2015 and in 2017 as part of the sustainability checks that are carried out prior to purchasing wood fibre drax collects information on each harvesting tract this includes the location of the site the type of harvest the owners longterm management intentions and species and volume details this data can then be used at a later date to revisit the site and monitor the condition of the area thirdparty auditors for instance through sustainable biomass program sbp certification  do visit harvesting sites however this is typically during the year of harvest rather than after restocking maxar has historical imagery of this region from 2010 which is prior to any harvesting for wood pellets the image below shows a harvesting site near the pellet plant at gloster mississippi before any harvesting has taken place march 2010 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies the image below shows the same site in 2017 immediately following harvesting december 2017 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies if we look again at this same site three years after harvesting we can see the rows of trees that have been planted and the quality of the regrowth this series of images demonstrates that this harvested area has remained a forest has not been subject to deforestation and that the regrowth appears to be healthy at this stage august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies another site in the amite catchment area is shown below the image shows a mature forest prior to harvesting the site has been previously thinned as can be seen from the thinned rows that are evident in the imagery may 2010 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies looking at the same site in the year after harvesting the clear cut area can be seen clearly some green vegetation cover can also be seen on the harvested area but this is weed growth rather than replanted trees some areas of mature trees have been left at the time of harvesting and are visible as a grey colour in the 2010 image these are likely to be streamside management zones that have been left to maintain biodiversity and to protect water quality with the grey winter colouring suggesting that they are hardwoods september 2018 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies three years after the harvest in a zoomed in view from the previous image clear rows of replanted trees can be seen in the imagery this demonstrates that the owner has successfully restocked the forest area and that the newly planted forest appears healthy and well established august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies while examining different harvesting sites in satellite imagery drax noted that not every site had evidence of tree growth particularly within the first three years after harvesting deliberate conversion of land to nonforest use such as for conversion to pasture agricultural crops or urban development is likely to be evident fairly soon after harvesting preparing for planting some forest owners like to leave a harvested site unplanted for a couple of years to allow ground vegetation and weed growth to establish this can then be treated to ensure that trees can be planted and that the weed growth does not impede the establishment of the new forest this process can mean that trees are not visible in satellite imagery for three to four years after harvesting the image below shows a site three years after harvesting with no evidence of tree growth given that no conversion of land use is evident and that the site appears to be clear of weed growth this is likely to be an example of where the owners have waited to clear the site of weeds prior to replanting this site can be monitored in future imagery from the maxar satellites to ensure that forest regrowth does take place november 2020 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies drax will continue to use maxars securewatch platform to monitor the regrowth of harvesting sites and will publish more detailed results and analysis when this process has been developed further the platform allows ongoing comparison of a site over time and could prove a more efficient method of analysis than ground survey in conjunction with the caa and hfl work phe can add remote sensing as a valuable monitoring and evidencegathering tool to demonstrate robust

excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas we are determined to create a

unit to be operating by 2027 the potential of beccs as part of the path to net zero has been widely recognised beccs in power is an important part of all of the climate change committee cccs net zero scenarios contributing to negative emissions of between 16 39mt co 2 e per year by 2050 2  investment needs to occur early by 2035 the ccc sees a role for 34gw of beccs as part of a mix of low carbon generation 3  the governments energy white paper commits by 2022 to establishing the role which beccs can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed the government has also committed to invest up to 1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture usage and storage ccus in four industrial clusters 4  national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes indicate that it is not possible to achieve net zero without beccs 5  however at present a business model 6 which could enable this investment is not in place a business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible there is no market for negative emissions there is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them positive spillovers are not remunerated  positive spillovers that would be delivered by a firstofakind beccs power plant but which are not remunerated include providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage ts infrastructure that can be used by subsequent ccs projects delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent beccs power plants and delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of ccs projects including hydrogen production with ccs beccs relies on the presence of co 2 transport and storage infrastructure  where this infrastructure doesnt already exist or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain this presents a significant risk to investors in beccs in power ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload frontier economics has been commissioned by drax to develop and evaluate business model options for beccs in power that could overcome these barriers and help deliver timely investment in beccs business model options we started with a long list of business model options after eliminating options that are unsuitable for beccs in power we considered the following three options in detail power contract for difference cfd the strike price of the cfd would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits carbon payment a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions the payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two options above the carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power cfd would support power market revenues for the plants renewable power output we first considered if committing to any of these business model options for beccs in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader ggr support scheme we assessed whether these options could over time be transitioned into a broader ggr support scheme ie one not just focused on beccs in power and concluded that this would be possible for all of them we then considered how these business model options could be funded and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds for example power cfds are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the low carbon contracts company lccc we concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options so the two decisions can be made independently this means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel we then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the beis consultation on business models for ccs summarised in the figure below figure 1 principles for design of business models instil investor confidence  attract innovation  attract new entrants  instil supply chain confidence cost efficiency  drive efficient management of investment costs  drive efficient quantity of investment  drive efficient dispatch and operation  risks allocated in an efficient way taking into account the impact on the cost of capital feasibility  limit administrative burden  practicality for investors  requirement for complementary policy  wider policy and state aid compatibility  timely implementation fair cost sharing  allows fair and practical cost distribution ease of policy transition  ease of transition to subsidy free system  ease of transition to technology neutral solution source frontier economics click to viewdownload graphic all three business model options performed well across most criteria however our evaluation highlighted some key tradeoffs to consider when choosing a business model investor confidence the power cfd and the twopart model with a cfd performed better than the carbon payment on this measure as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations feasibility the power cfd performed best on this measure because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood it will be quick to implement introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation however this will be needed in any case to support other ccus technologies 7  and could be introduced in time before projects come online and potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free all three options could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral however the standalone power cfd performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions overall the twopart model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world delivering learnings that will be relevant for other ggrs as well conclusions the uks net zero target will be challenging to achieve and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hardtoabate sectors as highlighted by the ccc 8  beccs in power is a particularly important part of this picture and represents a costeffective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed early investment in beccs is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of back ending significant abatement effort however market failures most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings and reliance on availability of ts infrastructure mean that without policy intervention the required level of beccs in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to net zero there are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers in our view a twopart model combining a power cfd and a carbon payment is preferable this measure addresses identified market failures can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early beccs in power investment and can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers including with reference to investors likely cost of capital and in a way that allocates risks appropriately viewdownload the full report pdf  1 biomass can be combusted to generate energy typically in the form of power but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel

keynote address below or scroll down the page to read his speech in full the energy transition is central to our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future drax has been at the heart of britains energy system for decades and we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector drax power station in selby north yorkshire is the uks largest power station and europes largest decarbonisation project cruachan our scottish pumped storage facility is a key complement to britains ever increasing supply of offshore wind our transition from coal to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the uk this month saw the end of commercial coal generation at drax power station  a milestone in the history of our company and of the uk economy too but the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here which is why we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon water outlet into loch awe from cruachan power station today we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with one ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster  the benefits are enormous beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change expert bodies such as the climate change committee here in the uk and the ipcc at a global level are clear that we need negative emissions technologies including beccs to reach net zero and beccs is central to the uk and europes decarbonisation plans as the worlds largest and most experienced generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to pioneer beccs than at drax the economic social and environmental benefits are enormous beccs at drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help heavy industry in the uks largest emitting area decarbonise quickly and cost effectively it will enable the creation of tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england levelling up the economy and delivering a green recovery from the covid crisis and it will put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to develop carbon removal technology in this the year that we host cop26 in glasgow the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here a proven technology we know that beccs works and that the technology is available now looking at cost projections from the ccc we also know that it is the best value negative emissions technology engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station we have already successfully run two beccs pilots at the power station in 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock and in 2020 we began a second pilot working with mitsubishi heavy industries to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions we aim to deploy beccs at scale by 2027 to that end earlier this month we kickstarted the planning process for our proposals to build our first beccs units  marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 the support we need drax power station has a proud history of transformation and today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future the core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close partnership with government  and it is this partnership that will make beccs a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it an effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as drax we believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months with cop26 later this year making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the uk beccs in context but we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen beccs will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero click to read thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago a partnership with our stakeholders the purpose of todays session is to discuss all these issues and more our aim is clear to enable a successful energy transition at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england but i want your help in making beccs as sustainable and successful as it can be we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests

to discuss attracting investment in emerging low carbon technologies drax at the heart of the energy transition my company drax has been at the heart of britains energy system for decades and we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector drax power station in selby north yorkshire is the uks largest power station and europes largest decarbonisation project cruachan our scottish pumped storage facility is a key complement to britains everincreasing supply of offshore wind our transition from coal to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by

history of our company and of the uk economy too but the drive to create a more sustainable net zero economy means that we cannot stop here which is why at drax we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  engineer in the workshop at drax power station we will achieve this by increasing our capacity to generate renewable electricity and by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere  we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with the same ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster i am delighted to confirm today that the zero carbon humber cluster project has received more than 21m in funding from the governments industrial strategy challenge fund to help accelerate our plans and to help transform our vision of a zero carbon industrial cluster into a reality the benefits are enormous beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change expert bodies such as the climate change committee here in the uk and the ipcc at a global level are clear that we need negative emissions technologies including beccs to reach net zero  and beccs is central to the uk government and europes decarbonisation plans as the

in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 a partnership between industry and government successful decarbonisation has always been a partnership between industry and government  this is evident looking at the incredible rise of britains offshore wind sector as a direct response to governments political commitment a strong price signal and an investable contract for difference mechanism offshore wind capacity has grown from 1gw to over 10gw in a decade and build costs are now two thirds lower than what they were 10 years ago pylon that takes excess wind power to be stored at cruachan pumped hydro storage power station in scotland at drax our conversion from coal to biomass was benefited from much the same framework the uk government was  and continues to be  very strong in its support for biomass as a renewable technology to replace coal our cfd mechanism has given investors the certainty they need to invest and successive governments commitment to a carbon price that matches or exceeds that of our european neighbours has told the market that britain is serious about decarbonising the power sector rapidly that combination of factors  a clear transparent investable framework for renewables combined with a strong price signal from the uk government discouraging fossil fuel power generation  has been the key to driving private sector investment in renewable power technology in the uk as a result the uk leads the world in decarbonising its electricity sector  while also enabling a global technology revolution in offshore wind power importantly the whole effort has been underpinned by transparency competition and confidence in the regulatory and legal framework all of which are critical building a partnership for the future by continuing this partnership between industry and government the uk could become the world leader in emerging green technologies such as beccs right now markets and regulatory frameworks for beccs or negative emissions more broadly either dont exist  or arent flexible enough  to support the scaling of the technologies we need to get to net zero  but the firstgeneration framework as i have just described provides a great model fundamentally we believe that we can do beccs at a cost of less than 100t of co 2  which is less than any other negative emissions technology available we know this investment will help the uk reach net zero at a lower cost than it otherwise could do maintenance inside a water cooling tower at drax power station but although were ready to make the investment  the uks regulatory system isnt yet ready to support it despite being world leaders in these areas our carbon pricing system and financial markets dont yet recognise the value of negative emissions even though our political institutions and scientists say they are vital to tackling climate change  there is no government defined business model for beccs which will be essential to signalling long term political support as well as operational support and despite being the best placed country in the world to develop beccs we risk losing out as other countries race to deploy this technology first just last week we saw aker microsoft and orsted sign a memorandum of understanding to develop beccs in denmark however in its tenpoint plan  the uk government has committed to outline what role biomass and beccs will play in the uks transition to net zero by the end of this year soon it will be consulting on a new bioenergy strategy and it has already taken evidence on greenhouse gas removal technologies and consulted on ccs clusters this we believe demonstrates that a set of policies could emerge in the coming months that will support investment in beccs at their core we think these policies should capture the stability and investability of a cfd for the renewable power that we will produce as well as deliver payment for the negative emissions by compensating negative emissions with a credit for every ton of co 2 they remove from the environment the government can properly reward those technologies and add a critical new set of tools to the fight against climate change  ultimately lower the cost of winning that battle this would enable drax to invest in beccs begin delivering negative emissions and helping to decarbonise the north of england as soon as 2027 with cop26 later this year making this policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future develop here in the uk beccs in context we know
