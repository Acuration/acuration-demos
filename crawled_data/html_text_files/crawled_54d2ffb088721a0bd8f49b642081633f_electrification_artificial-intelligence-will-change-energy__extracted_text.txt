artificial intelligence will change energy from producer to consumer ai will change your relationship with energy 20 september 2017 electrification at the beginning of 2016 the worlds most sophisticated artificial intelligence ai beat world champion lee sedol at a game called go  a chesslike board game with more move combinations than there are atoms in the universe before this defeat go had been considered too complicated for even the most complex computers to beat the top humans it was a landmark moment in the development of evermore sophisticated ai technology but the future of ai holds more than simply board game victories it is rapidly finding its way into all aspects of modern life prompting the promise of a fourth industrial revolution one of the areas ai has huge potential is in our energy system and this could have implications for generators consumers and the environment artificial intelligence playing traditional board game go concept the national grid gets wise earlier this year the uks national grid revealed its making headway in integrating ai technology into britains electricity system it announced a deal with googleowned ai company and creator of the go championbeating system deepmind which is set to improve the power networks transmission efficiency by as much as 10  one of the national grids most important tasks is maintaining the frequency of britains power networks to within 1 of 50hz  too high a frequency and electrical equipment gets damaged too low a frequency and you get blackouts managing this relies on ensuring electricity supply and demand are carefully balanced but this is made increasingly difficult with the growing number of intermittent renewables  such as wind and solar  on the grid the ability to process massive amounts of information from a wide variety of data points from weather forecasts to internet searches to tv listings  and create predictive models means ai can preempt surges in demand or instances of oversupply in short it can predict when the country will need more power and when it will need less more than this it can respond to these fluctuations in sustainable and lowcarbon ways for example it can automate demand side response where energy users scale back their usage at peak times for a reward similarly it can automate the purchasing of power from battery systems storing renewable energy such as those connected to domestic solar arrays these solutions which would see ai help to manage supply and demand imbalances would ease some grid management pressures while large thermal generators controlled by human engineers back up such automation with their continuing focus on maintaining grid stability through ancillary services the role of the smart city an undoubtedly large factor in the growing sophistication of ai in the energy space is the amount of energy use data now being captured and this has much to do with the increasing prevalence of smart devices and connected technology smart meters  which will be offered to every uk home by 2020  such as alphabets nest smart thermostat and startup verdigriss energy conserving internet of things iot devices are just a few of the emerging technologies using data to improve individuals abilities to monitor and optimise their household energy use but at scale information collected from these devices can be used by ai to help control energy distribution and efficiency across entire cities  and not just at a macro level but right down to individual devices the idea of a central computer controlling home utilities may seem like a soft invasion of privacy to some but when it comes to the energyintensive function of charging electric vehicles evs much of this optimisation will be carried out in public on street charge points  as ai and smart technology continue to grow more sophisticated it has the potential to do more than just improve efficiency instead it could fundamentally change consumers relationships with energy changing consumer relationships with energy startups in the energy space such as seattlebased drift  are exploring how trends such as peertopeer services and automated trading can be enabled through machine ai and give consumers greater control over their energy for a lower price the company offers consumers access to its own network of distributed and renewable energy sources currently operating in new york it uses ai to assess upcoming energy needs based on data collected from individual customers and locationspecific weather forecasts it then uses this to buy power from its network of peertopeer energy providers using highfrequency algorithmic trading to reduce or eliminate price spikes if demand exceeds expectation yet to be operational in the uk this sort of automation and peertopeer energy supply hints at the increasing decentralisation of energy grids  which are moving away from relying only on a number of large generators instead modern grids are likely to rely on a mix of technologies generators and suppliers and this means a more complex system which is precisely why automation from a central ai system could be a positive step not only could it bring about optimisation and efficiency but it could slash emissions and costs for consumers this silent automation may not have the same headlinegrabbing qualities as beating a world champion in their chosen sport but its impact to the country could be far greater share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable bioenergy forests net zero and
