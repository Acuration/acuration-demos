news resources contact us 75 million bid win for zero carbon humbers net zero ambition 17032021 the humbers ambition to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster has moved a step closer with the news that the zero carbon humber zch partnership has been successful in its bid for government funding to unlock its major decarbonisation infrastructure project humber bridge the humbers news is further boosted by a successful bid from the northern endurance partnership nep which provides the offshore pipeline and safe storage for emissions captured both in the humber and in teesside which was also successful in a separate bid the three projects total nearly 240m of private and public funding to decarbonise the north east of england and potentially around 50 of the uks industrial carbon emissions in october 2020 twelve leading companies and organisations across the humber jointly submitted a 75 million bid with more than twothirds privately funded to accelerate decarbonisation in the uks most carbonintensive industrial region helping to support clean growth futureproof vital industries and protect and create new jobs the zch partnerships plan could help the region reach net zero by 2040 through low carbon hydrogen carbon capture and carbon removal technology this will be enabled by a shared pipeline network to carry hydrogen to industrial customers and remove carbon dioxide from power generation and industrial emitters transporting it to permanent storage in an offshore aquifer in the uks southern north sea via pipelines developed by nep serving both zch and net zero teesside nzt caption idattachment_832 alignaligncenter width1024 click to viewdownloadcaption the zch proposals alone could reduce the uks annual industrial cluster emissions by around 37 and safeguard 55000 existing jobs in the region whilst creating thousands of new stem roles and developing skills apprenticeships and educational opportunities in the area it will also help to secure the future for the humbers traditional heavy industry and related supply chains by enabling decarbonisation and creating opportunities for growth in new technologies the zch partnership includes associated british ports british steel centrica storage ltd drax group equinor mitsubishi power national grid ventures px group sse thermal saltend cogeneration company limited uniper and the university of sheffield advanced manufacturing research centre amrc the public funding to the zch partnership is from phase 2 of the industrial decarbonisation challenge which forms part of the industrial strategy challenge fund while the private funding comes from the companies within the zch partnership caption idattachment_845 alignaligncenter width10602 click to viewdownloadcaption the zch bids anchor project is the equinorled hydrogen to humber h2h saltend proposal which will establish the worlds largest hydrogen production plant with carbon capture on the humbers north bank h2h saltend will convert natural gas to hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide co 2  in the process in the first phase this could reduce emissions by circa 900000 tonnes per year as industrial customers at px groups saltend chemicals park switch fuel to lowcarbon hydrogen while triton powers gas power plant blends hydrogen into the fuel supply of its converted mitsubishi turbines h2h saltend is expected to grow over time contributing to further emissions reductions from the chemicals park and across the humber caption idattachment_860 alignaligncenter width1024 click to viewdownloadcaption a pipeline network developed by national grid ventures will link h2h saltend to energyintensive industrial sites throughout the region to enable further decarbonisation from projects across the humber through the capture of at least 17 million tonnes of co 2 emissions per year and the supply of up to 10 gigawatts of hydrogen by the mid2030s the co 2 will be compressed at centrica storages easington site and stored under the southern north sea using offshore infrastructure developed by nep in which equinor and national grid are two of the partners and shared with nzt in which equinor is a partner net zero teesside and the northern endurance partnership made separate bids to the same fund but are closely aligned due to their shared offshore infrastructure and storage options caption

and the onshore pipeline infrastructure for co2 and hydrogen enabling the scheme to move towards a final investment decision on construction during 2023 with h2h saltend and associated infrastructure expected to come online around 2026 at selby in north yorkshire drax power station would connect to the completed co 2 pipeline network underpinning the zch scheme with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  a vital negative emissions technology that drax is pioneering and which will be essential to decarbonising the humber cluster and helping the uk achieve its legally binding 2050 net zero carbon target drax has started the planning process to develop beccs and its first unit could be operational in 2027 delivering the uks largest carbon capture project caption idattachment_859

station equipped with carbon capture technology by the mid2020s providing decarbonised flexible power to complement intermittent renewables generation and maintain security of supply the network will also run via immingham where uniper is planning to add to its european hydrogen ambitions by developing clean hydrogen production at its killingholme site in line with unipers pledge to be carbon neutral in europe by 2035 as one of the uks leading steel manufacturers and a significant local employer british steel could benefit from the zch infrastructure as part of its drive to lower emissions abp the major ports and logistics provider for the region will support the global reach of the low carbon products and chemicals produced at scunthorpe and at saltend the zch projects are supported by the university of sheffield advanced manufacturing research centre which will work with its sister centre the nuclear amrc to support the anchoring of supply chain opportunities in the uk provided by these new technologies both centres are part of the high value manufacturing catapult in addition to the key sites that are part of the zch scheme there is further potential for other future projects to attract inward investment and cement the humbers reputation as the uks energy estuary and a worldleading net zero region these include integrating offshore wind power into hydrogen production decarbonising the regional gas grid supplying hydrogen transport fuelling hubs providing links to co 2 storage services to other industrial clusters and creating the worlds first sustainable maritime
