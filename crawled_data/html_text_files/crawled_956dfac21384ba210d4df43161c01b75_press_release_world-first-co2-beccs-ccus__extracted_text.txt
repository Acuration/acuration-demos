power station carbon dioxide now being captured in first of its kind beccs pilot the first beccs pilot project of its kind in the world at drax power station  the uks biggest renewable power generator has started capturing carbon dioxide 7 february 2019 the first carbon dioxide has been captured using ccapture technology at drax power station in their innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot this moves britain further ahead in the race to develop beccs technologies  essential in the fight against climate change the project could enable drax to become the worlds first negative emissions power station  reducing harmful greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere the demonstration plant at the power station near selby in north yorkshire is using innovative technology developed by leedsbased ccapture to capture a tonne of co 2 a day during the pilot it is the firsttime carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100 biomass feedstock anywhere in the world if the beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions  drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warning from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced engineers began commissioning the pilot plant in november with the first carbon now being captured proving that the proprietary solvent developed by ccapture can be used to isolate the carbon dioxide from the flue gases released when biomass is used to generate electricity data being obtained about the co 2 capture process will continue to be analysed throughout the pilot to fully understand the potential of the technology and how it could be scaled up at drax part of this will include identifying and developing ways to store and use the carbon dioxide being captured drax has invested 400000 in the pilot which could be the first of several projects undertaken at the power station to deliver a rapid lower cost demonstration of beccs will gardiner drax group ceo said proving that this innovative carbon capture technology works is an exciting development and another important milestone in our beccs project climate change affects us all so this is of real significance  not just for us at drax but also for the uk and the rest of the world the successful deployment of beccs requires us to identify ways in which the carbon dioxide were now capturing can be stored or used in other processes and were working with the government and other businesses on that were focused on working together to make the progress required for us to tackle climate change and enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that beccs could enable us to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  approximately half the nations emissions target the governments clean growth strategy identified beccs as one of several greenhouse gas removal technologies that could remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation minister for energy and clean growth claire perry said this innovative technology has the potential to make huge strides in our efforts to tackle climate change while kickstarting an entirely new cuttingedge industry in the uk worldfirsts like this will help us to realise our ambition of having a first operational plant by the mid2020s as we continue to seize the opportunities of moving to a greener cleaner economy  a key part of our modern industrial strategy chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds said this represents a major milestone on the road to achieving negative emissions through beccs which is going to be so important in the future to see our technology working in a real environment like drax is a tribute to the fantastic team of chemists and engineers who work on the project caspar schoolderman director of engineering at ccapture added working at this scale is really where the engineering gets interesting the challenge now is to get all the information we need to design and build a capture plant 10000 times bigger its only really when we get to those sorts of scales that we can start to have an impact on the climate drax power station became the largest decarbonisation project in europe by upgrading two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal as part of the beccs pilot it will examine options for a similar repurposing of existing infrastructure to deliver more carbon savings work has already been undertaken to ensure the solvent ccapture has developed is compatible with the biomass flue gas at drax power station this was completed last summer along with a labscale study into the feasibility of reutilising the flue gas desulphurisation fgd absorbers at the power station fgd equipment is vital for reducing sulphur emissions from coal but it is no longer required to control sulphur on four of the generating units at drax that have been upgraded to use biomass because the wood pellets used produce minimal levels of sulphur ccapture is a spinout from the school of chemistry at the university of leeds established through funding from ip group plc ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media and pr email protected 44 0 7712 670 888 jessica gorton press

ccapture carl clayton drax research and innovation engineer at the drax beccs plant which has successfully captured carbon animation viewdownload the animation editors notes drax power station is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world  around 70 of the electricity it produces is renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 drax is in discussions with the british beer and pub association to see if it could help keep the fizz in the drinks industry as part of its efforts to ensure the carbon captured during the beccs pilot project is used in another process or industry there are other markets which drax expects to provide significant opportunities such as using the co 2 captured in the creation of synthetic fuels drax is also working with the humber local enterprise partnership catch and other interested parties to explore the role ccus can play in turning the humber estuary into the worlds first netzero carbon cluster by 2040 it has plans to repower its two remaining coal generating units to use high efficiency flexible gas by reusing some of its existing infrastructure including the grid connection and cooling towers the development will be cost effective and very competitive it could also enable drax to stop using coal as soon as 2023 well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline reducing its emissions whilst playing a vital role in supporting the system as more renewables come online ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds university and has attracted support from ip group the department for business energy and industrial strategys energy entrepreneurs fund and the co 2 capture project for co 2 capture technology which has potential in a range of areas including biogas upgrading natural gas sweetening and hydrogen production the government has provided 22 million in support to ccapture to develop the carbon capture technology about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy
