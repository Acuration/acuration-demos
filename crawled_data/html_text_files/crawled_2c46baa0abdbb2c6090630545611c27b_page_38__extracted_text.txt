visiting the skylark nature reserve on april 24 th built the huge replica airship at a workshop run by drax power station held in tribute to the r33 which took flight for the first time in march 1919 after being built in nearby barlow the last of three giant airships constructed in the area the socalled gas bag was flown by the royal naval air service and used for a decade in both military and civilian tasks the site of the workshop where the r33 was designed and built is now known as the barlow mound which is close to drax power station and the 350acre nature reserve created by the company drax organised the event as part of its ongoing commitment to switch young people on to science technology engineering and maths stem drax power ceo andy koss said the centenary of the r33 gave us an opportunity to celebrate an exciting part of our local heritage through events like these we can also inspire more children to consider studying stem subjects and develop the skills businesses like ours need to continue to grow helping to build a strong regional economy as well as building the giant replica weaving recyclable willow into six separate sections before combining it into one huge model the young airship makers also paced out the entire 196 metres of the real r33s length to give them an idea of its sheer scale noah thornton aged seven said it must have been massive our model will be nine metres and thats big its taken a lot of work but its been good fun and i now know more about airships eightyearold mia socha added i built the second part of the model and weaving it all was the hardest part it looks really good now its all put together its been a great day and sevenyearold reuben delaney said all i knew about airships was that they flew but i know a lot more now and our model looks brilliant as well as encouraging stem learning drax is committed to developing the next generation of engineers  it has doubled the number of apprentices it is recruiting in 2019 compared to just two years ago the firm has also invested in a partnership with a number of local schools to enable them to build and race electric cars on the streets of hull at the end of the month again to promote greater engagement with stem skills ends media contacts mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email protected t 07969080272 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t

reggie and scottie robotics in action at energy supplier robotics technology is transforming the operations of one of the uks biggest business energy suppliers the project at northamptonoxfordbased opus energy has seen the technology known as robotic process automation rpa introduced for a number of processes within the companys operations one automation running over the christmas period cleared 20000 tasks in a matter of days saving staff at the firm part of drax group the uks biggest renewable electricity supplier to businesses hours of mundane checking and data entry it was also carried out at a time when normally staff would not have been available plans are now being developed to rollout the robotic automations further into the firms operations the energy supplier says the aim is to free up staff time to focus on more rewarding and engaging tasks as well providing service improvements so far six processes at the business have had automation introduced covering credit work registrations billing metering and back office processes with plans for further automations to be carried out throughout this year and the hightech arrivals have been welcomed into the business by being given nicknames by the teams they work in billie is now classed as part of the billing team and is joined by reggie for customer registrations and scottie for change of tenancy cot work ian blackburn heading the intelligent automation programme at opus energy said the feedback from our operational teams has been great the extra thinking time that rpa is already creating for our people is also really appreciated by using this technology we can free up their time and allow people to put their skills and expertise to better use and prevent them getting bogged down in more repetitive admin work well then see the benefit in terms of efficiencies but also in levels of staff motivation we believe our customers will also see the positives in further improvements to our billing and customer services so its something that will potentially benefit everyone jonathan kini ceo of drax retail which includes opus energy and haven power added innovation is at the heart of everything we do and the energy world is evolving quickly data and the way we use it will help our customers change the way they use energy saving them money in the process and helping make their businesses more sustainable the latest generation of smart meters will produce far better data so the quicker we can process that the better our people will then be able to focus on spending more time helping customers rather than data inputting and admin last year it was confirmed that opus energy and haven power together had provided more than 350000 uk businesses with renewable electricity a new record which made them collectively the largest suppliers of renewable power to businesses in the uk the company is also currently trialling innovative battery storage technology at a farm in northamptonshire which if successful would enable sustainable businesses to store power generated from their own solar panels or wind turbines and then sell it back to the grid at peak times providing an additional revenue source ends notes to editors drax power station announced last year that it was going to pilot the use of robots in its administrative processes for checking in rail deliveries

proposals to repower its two remaining coalfired generating units with new high efficiency gas turbines by friday october 4 2019 the drax repower project aims to deliver up to 36gw of reliable and flexible power generation and up to 200mw of battery storage to help enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc said last year that by 2050 85 of the worlds electricity will need to come from renewables like wind and solar power if we are to meet our climate change targets this means the remaining 15 will need to come from flexible and reliable technologies like gas biomass hydro and pumped storage andy koss drax power ceo said by using high efficiency gas turbines we can continue to deliver flexible and reliable generating capacity as well as system support services which are vital for maintaining secure power supplies as more intermittent renewables come online if the repower project goes ahead we could stop using coal ahead of the governments 2025 deadline protecting jobs and preserving the life of the power station building modern high efficiency gas power stations will enable ageing less efficient plant to close reducing emissions and supplying the reliable and flexible power needed to provide vital system support services now the examination phase of the application process has closed the examination authority will consider the evidence given and has three months to make a recommendation to the secretary of state at beis about whether to approve or reject the proposals several other workstreams are running in
