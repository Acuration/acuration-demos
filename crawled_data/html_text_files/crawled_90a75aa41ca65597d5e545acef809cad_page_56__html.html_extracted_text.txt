Family fun at Easter Eggstravaganza
7 April 2015
Uncategorized

Record numbers turned up to support the fifth annual Easter Eggstravaganza at Drax Nature Reserve and Skylark Centre on Easter Sunday.
Over 1,200 children and parents joined the giant woodland egg hunt – with help from a life-sized Easter Bunny and Rooster – and enjoyed a range of fun-filled activities while raising money for Selby Hands of Hope.
The event, organised by Drax, included an arts and crafts workshop with flower-making and face painting. Rare breed sheep and goats and an animal petting area also provided education and entertainment for all.
Drax community campaign coordinator Ann Gray was there to join in the fun.
She said: “It’s great to see the Drax Easter Eggstravaganza becoming such a well-supported annual event on the community calendar. Everyone was having a brilliant time and together we raised over £1,600 for local charity Selby Hands of Hope which will go to support a variety of projects in the area.”

DCO Examination Phase Closed
2 April 2015
Press releases

The DCO Examination Phase for Watt Power’s Progress Power Project, near Eye concluded in January 2015, and is currently under consideration by the Planning Inspectorate.
In accordance with the statutory DCO timetable, a decision as to whether or not to grant Development Consent Orders to the project is expected from the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in mid-July 2015.
Assuming the DCO is granted to the project, it is Watt Power’s intention to enter the Progress Power Project in the UK’s Capacity Market Auction.  Subject to the outcome of the Auction and the project’s financing, Watt Power would expect the plants to commence construction within 12 months of the auction, with commercial operation approximately 18 months later.



Submission of DCO Application Deferred
30 March 2015
Press releases

The project is in a position to submit an application for a Development Consent Order to the Planning Inspectorate and MPL will continue to monitor market conditions to determine the appropriate time for submission.



Millbrook Power shares final plans with local councils
9 February 2015
Press releases

Millbrook Power (MPL) has made one significant change to the project since it last met the local authorities in November: MPL has chosen to underground the electrical cable connection for its power project, thereby avoiding the need to construct new overhead lines and new transmission towers. The decision to go underground (the gas pipeline connection will also be underground) will significantly reduce the visual impact of the project and has been taken after careful consideration of the views held by local councillors and local people, and MPL’s completion of its technical and environmental studies that have been carried out over the past 12 months.
Nick Johnson, MPL’s Project Manager said: “The local councillors welcomed our decision to go underground with the electrical connection; this follows our decision, last year, to reduce the height of the power station stacks after considering the results of technical studies. The councillors also acknowledged the measures that we will take to minimise other impacts of the power project. Our project is situated on land allocated for development but we have always been mindful of the views of local people, and fully appreciate the local environment and the heritage of the area.”
Jason Longhurst, Director of Regeneration at Central Bedfordshire Council said: “It has been very useful to have been engaged early in this important development and we’re pleased that Millbrook Power has provided changes to reduce the visual impact of the development.”
Millbrook Power intends to submit its application to the Planning Inspectorate before the end of March and there should then follow a six month period of examination during which time the local councils and other interested parties can express their views.
Subject to the outcome of the Planning Inspectorate’s examination process and the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change granting a Development Consent Order, the Millbrook Power project could enter commercial operation in 2019/2020.
Notes to editors:
The underground electrical connection will export the electricity that is generated by the power plant via a new sub-station into the National Grid. The underground gas pipeline will deliver natural gas, the power station’s only fuel source, from the UK national gas transmission system to the power generation plant.
The £200m MPL project was first announced in May 2014. Since then, MPL’s technical and environmental studies have considered a range of issues such as noise, air quality, visual impact, ecology and transport. In addition, MPL has publicised its plans via various channels, consulted the local councils in the area and a range of other interested parties and held two series of public exhibitions.
Subject to planning and financing, construction of the project could start in 2017/2018 for a 2-3 year period. The plant (up to 299MW capacity) will only run at times when electricity demand is at its highest, mainly during the winter months, and on those occasions when there is intermittent output from renewable sources of energy, primarily wind and solar.
The project would be a substantial and long-term investment in the area, seeing the creation of around 150 construction jobs, up to 15 permanent skilled jobs and potential business opportunities for local companies. MPL is consulting Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Councils on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits to the surrounding area.

Progress Power’s Response to Dr Dan Poulter MP
16 January 2015
Press releases

“We have met Dr Poulter on a number of occasions to discuss our proposed project, which is presently being considered by the Planning Inspectorate. We have explained to Dr Poulter and the Planning Inspectorate our reasons for choosing the airfield site for the location of the gas-fired power station, which in principle the local authorities support.
“We have also explained our reasons for the location of the substation, and outlined the work that we will undertake to minimise its visual impact, including the undergrounding of the necessary electrical connection. In addition, we have outlined our initiatives to bring wider benefit to the local area, whilst working with the local councils.
“If our project is approved and built, it will help deliver the Government’s energy and environment policies.”



Statutory consultation on the Abergelli Power Project has now closed
4 December 2014
Press releases

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you if you took the time to provide us with feedback. Your views are important to us.
As part of the statutory consultation process we engaged with the local community – distributing more than 13,000 leaflets to homes and businesses in the vicinity of the site in advance of a series of public exhibitions at Llangyfelach, Felindre, Clydach and Tircoed between 22 and 25 October 2014. Across the four days, more than 100 people visited the exhibitions. We have also liaised closely – and continue to do so – with the City & County of Swansea and relevant community councils.
In addition, we have been in contact with stakeholders such as Natural Resources Wales, Cadw and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. We anticipate that these and other technical stakeholders will provide comments, following this formal consultation stage, which we will consider as we finalise our Development Consent Order application.
The feedback received during the public exhibitions was broadly positive. We are continuing to refine our proposals where concerns were raised, in particular to mitigate the potential visual impact of the Project where possible and to secure the preferred access option from the B4489 to the west of the Project site.
Comments on the Project, and its operation as a flexible, peaking power plant which would support security of energy supply in the future were also received from local people.
Following consideration of all responses returned by stakeholders and the local community, we are now focused on refining our design and submitting an application for a Development Consent Order to the Planning Inspectorate in the first quarter of 2015. That application will be accompanied by an Environmental Statement, which will provide detailed information on a range of topics, including air quality, noise and vibration, landscape and visual impact and traffic, transport and access.
The application will also include a Consultation Report. This document will describe how we have had regard to feedback received and indicate how this has been taken into account in the development and design of the project.
Once the application has been submitted to the Planning Inspectorate and accepted for examination, the application documents, including the Environmental Statement and the Consultation Report, will be available to view and download from this website, from the Abergelli Power Limited project pages of the Planning Inspectorate’s website and to view at local libraries and council offices. Hard copies of the application documents will also be available to buy.
Once the application is accepted for examination, it will proceed through the examination phase where the local community and other relevant stakeholders can make representations to the Planning Inspectorate. Assuming that the application is submitted in early 2015, we would expect a decision from the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change in the middle of 2016 and, subject to further permitting and financing, the Project could enter commercial operation in 2019/2020.
If you have any queries relating to the project, please do not hesitate to contact us by calling 0131 550 3395, sending an email to
[email protected]
or by writing FREEPOST RTEY-JYYB-ERSR, Abergelli Power Ltd, 49 York Place, Edinburgh EH1 3JD.



Statutory Consultation Period Ends
26 November 2014
Press releases

This period was designed to attain feedback from the public and relevant organisations about the proposal. The Millbrook Power team received a range of comments from local residents, local businesses, local councillors as well as the relevant planning authorities and other local and national organisations that have an interest in the Project.
During this consultation period, four public exhibitions were held in Stewartby, Lidlington, Ampthill and Marston Moretaine. These exhibitions, attended by around 175 people, provided the public with information on the Project and the developments of the proposal, as well as the opportunity to ask questions to the Millbrook Power team who were present at the events. Significantly, these exhibitions provided opportunity for local residents to provide us with feedback.
The exhibitions were advertised locally and a leaflet about the Project, which included a feedback form, was delivered to households and businesses in the area surrounding the site at Rookery South Pit.
Chris McKerrow and Nick Johnson, the Director and Manager of the Millbrook Power Project respectively, also gave a talk to sixth form students at Kimberley College on the Future of Energy in the UK. Amongst other things the talk explained the need for projects such as this, and described the Project and the work that we are doing to bring it forward.
Now that the period of consultation has ended, the Millbrook team are collating the information received and finalising certain aspects of the design accordingly, taking account of any concerns raised by the public during consultation. Documentation for our submission to the Planning Inspectorate is also being prepared, such as the Environmental Statement and our Consultation Report, which will be available to the public once the submission has been made. The submission is expected in the first quarter of next year.
In the meantime, Millbrook Power will continue to liaise with Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council, as well as the local parish councils in the area to ensure they are fully informed of the Project’s evolution and status.

Statutory consultation begins on £200m power plant proposal for Abergelli Farm
10 October 2014
Press releases

Abergelli Power Limited (APL), an energy development company established by Watt Power Limited, will be consulting on the £200m proposal between 13 October 2014 and 16 November 2014.
The proposed Project would produce up to 299 megawatts (MW) of electricity, and represent a significant multi million pound investment into the local economy. It could support up to 150 jobs during the 2-3 year construction and commissioning period, and up to 15 full-time jobs when operational.
The modern gas-fired plant would have low emissions and would help strengthen and secure the UK’s energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from renewable sources – primarily wind and solar. It would be designed to operate flexibly (i.e. not always running) and permitted to produce electricity for no more than 1,500 hours per year.
As the plant will produce more than 50MW of electricity, it is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project. This means that a Development Consent Order is required to build, operate and maintain it. An application for a Development Consent Order will be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate with a final decision taken by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.
The proposal was first presented to the local community during non-statutory public exhibitions in June this year, and statutory consultation will show how the project has developed since then.
APL has taken into account initial community feedback, alongside ongoing engagement with City & County of Swansea (CCS) and authorities such as Natural Resources Wales, and the company’s own technical and environmental studies. The consultation period will now give members of the local community the opportunity to learn more about, comment on, and potentially influence the proposals before an application for a Development Consent Order is submitted.
APL has produced a Statement of Community Consultation, detailing the consultation programme. It includes a number of exhibition events, which will be an opportunity for local people and interested organisations to see the plans and give their views on the proposals. CCS has been consulted on the consultation programme.
The exhibitions will be held on:
•
Wednesday 22nd October 2014, 15:00-20:00
– Llangyfelach Church Hall, Swansea Road, Llangyfelach, Swansea SA5 7JA
•
Thursday 23rd October 2014, 14:00-19:00
– Felindre Welfare Hall, Felindre, Swansea, SA5 7NA
•
Friday 24th October 2014, 14:00-19:00
– Forge Fach Resource Centre, Hebron Road, Clydach, Swansea, SA6 5EJ
•
Saturday 25th October 2014, 09:00-13:00
– Tircoed Village Hall, Y Cyswllt, Tircoed SA4 9QZ
Members of the APL project team will be on hand at these events to explain the proposed Project, how to get involved in the consultation process, and to answer any questions the community may have. Preliminary assessments of the likely significant environmental effects of the project will also be available for viewing.
APL’s Project director Norman Campbell said:
“Consultation with local communities and organisations is vitally important to us. It provides us with an opportunity to explain our project in detail and get feedback to help with the development of our proposals. Our initial phase of consultation in June gave us the chance to communicate directly with local people, gather their views and address their concerns.
“We will now explain how the project has moved forward in recent months and provide more detailed information. One of the key changes we have made is to reduce the height of the stacks of the plant. Following community feedback and our technical and environmental work, we can confirm that they will be no taller than 40 metres. This decision is just one of the steps we have taken to minimise the environmental and visual impact of the Project.
“We are also looking for people’s views on the environmental work we have carried out to date, the proposed route options for accessing the Project, and our proposed layout of the plant within the Project site.
“We hope that as many people as possible will attend our public exhibition days, or see the information we have made available on the project website and deposited at local libraries. We will advertise the formal consultation in local media and are also distributing more than 13,000 leaflets to homes and businesses in the area in the vicinity of the site.”
At the end of the consultation period APL will finalise its proposals before submitting an application for a Development Consent Order. Subject to the consultation and planning process and financing, the power plant could enter commercial operation in 2019/2020.
