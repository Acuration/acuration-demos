the world cup the now famous image of paul gascoigne crying into his shirt is beamed across millions of uk television screens theres a shuffling on the sofas in front of those tvs as the population gets up to make a cup of tea get a drink or turn on the oven millions of kettles lights and fridges are powered up as the country collectively despairs the demand for electricity across the country soars this is whats called a tv pickup  the moment during a popular television event when theres a break and viewers unwittingly cause a huge surge of demand from the national grid its these moments that have caused some of the biggest spikes in uk electricity demand here we look at whats caused them one what football world cup semi final england v west germany when wednesday 4 july 1990 electricity demand 2800mw  equivalent to 1120000 kettles based on 1mw  400 kettles or 43 draxsized generation units there are six 645mw units at drax after that fateful penalty miss the population made for the kitchen the match was watched by an estimated 26 million people in the uk and when full time was called they caused a 2800mw surge in electricity demand two what the thorn birds when 22 january 1984 electricity demand 2600mw  1040000 kettles  4 drax units a sleeper hit the thorn birds was a oneoff american miniseries about a fictional sheep station in the australian outback based on the novel of the same name it was broadcast in the uk following building up a huge following in the us when it was aired in 1983 by the time it arrived on uk shores there was clearly enough of that excitement to create a surge of electricity demand  one of the largest in uk tv history three what football world cup quarter final england v brazil when friday 21 june 2002 electricity demand 2570mw  1028000 kettles  4 drax units broadcast early on a wednesday morning in the uk due to time differences with south korea where the game was played the match saw england put up a solid fight against overall tournament winners brazil a goal from michael owen provided early hope and at half time tv viewers left their screens to cause a huge 2570mw spike in demand by the time the game had reached its conclusion brazil had won thanks to a chipped ronaldinho free kick that fooled england keeper david seaman and those viewers who had lasted the duration caused a slightly smaller 2300mw surge four what eastenders lisa admits shooting phil when thursday 5 april 2001 electricity demand 2290mw  916000 kettles  35 drax units in one of the most dramatic plot developments in uk tv history lisa shaw played by actress lucy benjamin admitted to shooting her former boyfriend phil mitchell an estimated 22 million viewers turned on to see the dramatic reveal when it was all over they caused a surge of 2290mw more than five times the normal pickup of 400mw seen at the end of an average eastenders episode five what the darling buds of may when sunday 12 may 1991 electricity demand 2200mw  880000 kettles  34 drax units one of the more wholesome entries to the list this british comedy drama racked up a huge following during its 20episode run from 1991 to 1993 the peak was early in the first season when the third ever episode saw the larkin family take an unhappy holiday to brittany the familys escapades drew a large audience and prompted a surge equivalent to 880000 kettles being switched on at the same time six what rugby world cup final england v australia when saturday 22 november 2003 electricity demand 2110mw  844000 kettles  33 drax units a unique sporting entry to the list as england ended as winners more than 12 million people watched england beat australia with the largest electricity demand coming at half time and not at full time when audiences were presumably still celebrating jonny wilkinsons last minute drop goal seven what european football championship 2020 final england vs italy when sunday 11 july 2021 electricity demand 1800mw  720000 kettles  28 drax units the most recent heartbreaker for england fans the match came as covid19 restrictions were only beginning to lift around the uk the team led by gareth southgate conquered old foes germany on their way to a final in wembley only to lose to italy on penalties the sense of disappointment was almost palpable in the energy demand peaking at 1800mw at halftime when england went into the changing rooms onenil up demand then surged again to 1200mw at the end of the 90minute stalemate followed by a deflated 500mw at the end of the game had things gone differently national grid eso was preparing for a peak of 2000mw eight what the royal wedding  prince william and kate when friday 29 april 2011 electricity demand 1600mw  640000 kettles  25 drax units the biggest and most celebrated royal wedding in a generation the marriage of prince william and kate middleton attracted an audience of 24 million in the uk alone energy demand peaked at 1600mw when the brides carriage procession returned to buckingham palace this is the largest tv pickup in recent years which hints at how changing viewer habits on demand watching and smart tvs are changing the need for power and making tv pickups a rarer occurrence nine what clap for carers when thursday 16 april 2020 electricity demand 950mw  320000 kettles  15 drax units covid19 and subsequent lockdowns had several interesting effects on the uks energy system  one feature was a return in regular demand spikes with thursday evenings clap for carers events prompting notable surges the gestures held at 8pm on thursdays between 26 march and 28 may 2020 saw millions across the uk stand outside their homes and clap in appreciation of emergency services workers as people went back inside to put on kettles and turn on tvs electricity demand spiked the particularly cloudy evening of 16 april saw demand reach 950mw as more people reached for light switches how do we deal with tv pickups national grid electricty pylon at sunrise because the level of electricity needed to power the country cant be stored when there is a spike in demand it needs to be met quickly by a similar increase in real time generation to manage the supply and demand for events likely to cause electricity surges the national grid forecasts electricity need for large events like world cups and major tv events the grid can then put contingency measures in place to manage the huge changes in demand in real time it does this through a suite of tools called balancing mechanisms which allows it to access sources of extra power in realtime the rise of more energy efficient home appliances and ondemand streaming means that the shape of electricity demand has become flatter since the days when most of the country was tuned into the same mustsee moments however its still crucial for the grid to forecast periods of high demand when it will keep the necessary power stations on reserve ready to deliver additional electricity if needed if it wasnt for this careful management of electricity by the grid and the power stations like drax supplying it that cup of tea next time england crash out of a major sporting event would not only be tainted with disappointment but cold too tags technology  history  power station 14 moments that electrified history 13 may 2020 electrification electricity is such a universal and accepted part of our lives its become something we take for granted rarely do we stop to consider the path it took to become ubiquitous and yet through the course of its history there have been several eureka moments and breakthrough inventions that have shaped our modern lives here are some of the defining moments in the development of electricity and power 2750 bc  electricity first recorded in the form of electric fish ancient egyptians referred to electric catfish as the  thunderers of the nile  and were fascinated by these creatures it led to a near millennia of wonder and intrigue including conducting and documenting crude experiments  such as touching the fish with an iron rod to cause electric shocks 500 bc  the discovery of static electricity around 500 bc thales of miletus discovered that static electricity could be made by rubbing lightweight objects such as fur or feathers on amber this static effect remained unknown for almost 2000 years until around 1600 ad when william gilbert discovered static electricity in earnest 1600 ad  the origins of the word electricity the latin word electricus  which translates to of amber was used by the english physician william gilbert to describe the force exerted when items are rubbed together a few years later english scientist thomas browne translated this into electricity in his written investigations in the field 1751  benjamin franklins experiments and observations on electricity this book of benjamin franklin s discoveries made about the behaviour of electricity was published in 1751 the publication and translation of american founding father scientist and inventors letters would provide the basis for all further electricity experimentation it also introduced a host of new terms to the field including positive negative charge battery and electric shock 1765  james watt transforms the industrial revolution watt studies newcomens engine james watt transformed the industrial revolution with the invention of a modified newcome engine now known as the watt steam engine  machines no longer had to rely on the sometimestemperamental wind water or manpower  instead steam from boiling water could drive the pistons back and forth although watts engine didnt generate electricity it created a foundation that would eventually lead to the steam turbine  still the basis of much of the globes electricity generation today james watts steam engine alessandro volta 1800  voltas first true battery documented records of batterylike objects date back to 250 bc but the first true battery was invented by italian scientist alessandro volta in 1800  volta realised that a current was created when zinc and silver were immersed in an electrolyte  the principal on which chemical batteries are still based today 1800s  the first electrical cars breakthroughs in electric motors and batteries in the early 1800s led to experimentation with electrically powered vehicles the british inventor robert anderson is often credited with developing the first crude electric carriage at the beginning of the 19 th century but it would not be until 1890 that american chemist william morrison would invent the first practical electric car though it closer resembled a motorised wagon boasting a top speed of 14 miles per hour michael faraday 1831  michael faradays electric dynamo faradays invention of the electric dynamo power generator set the precedent for electricity generation for centuries to come his invention converted motive or mechanical power  such as steam gas water and wind turbines  into electromagnetic power at a low voltage although rudimentary it was a breakthrough in generating consistent continuous electricity and opened the door for the likes of thomas edison and joseph swan whose subsequent discoveries would make largescale electricity generation feasible 1879  lighting becomes practical and inexpensive thomas edison patented the first practical and accessible incandescent light bulb  using a carbonised bamboo filament which could burn for more than 1200 hours edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent lightbulb on 31 st december 1879 where he stated that electricity would be so cheap that only the rich would burn candles although he was not the only inventor to experiment with incandescent light his was the most enduring and practical he would soon go on to develop not only the bulb but an entire electrical lighting system  holborn viaduct power station via wikimedia 1882  the worlds first public power station opens holborn viaduct power station also known as the edison electric light station  burnt coal to drive a steam turbine and generate electricity the power was used for holborns newly electrified streetlighting an idea which would quickly spread around london 1880s  tesla and edisons current war nikola tesla and thomas edison waged what came to be known as the current war in 1880s america tesla was determined to prove that alternating current ac  as is generated at power stations  was safe for domestic use going against the edison groups opinion that a direct current dc  as delivered from a battery  was safer and more reliable inside an edison power station in new york the conflict led to years of risky demonstrations and experiments including one where tesla electrocuted himself in front of an audience to prove he would not be harmed the war continued as they fought over the future of electric power generation until eventually ac won nikola tesla 1901  great britains first industrial power station opens before charles mertz and william mclellan of merz  mclellan built the neptune bank power station in tyneside in 1901 individual factories were powered by private generators by contrast the neptune bank power station could supply reliable cheap power to multiple factories that were connected through highvoltage transmission lines this was the beginning of britains national grid system 1990s  the first mass market electrical vehicle ev concepts for electric cars had been around for a century however the general motors ev1 was the first model to be mass produced by a major car brand  made possible with the breakthrough invention of the rechargeable battery however this ev1 model could not be purchased only directly leased on a monthly contract because of this its expensive build and relatively small customer following the model only lasted six years before general motors crushed the majority of their cars 2018  renewable generation accounts

the remainder tags stem science technology engineering and mathematics  electric vehicles evs  electricity generation  electricity  history  engineering  power station  technology how turbines came to power the world 5 september 2018 power generation charles algernon parsons knew he was onto something in 1884 the young engineer had joined a ship engineering firm and developed a steam turbine engine which he immediately saw had a bigger potential than powering boats he connected it to a dynamo turning it into a generator capable of producing up to 75 kilowatts kw of power and in the process kickstarted an electrical and mechanical revolution that would reshape how electricity was produced and how the world worked today turbinebased generation is the dominant method for electricity production throughout the world and even now  almost a century and a half later  parsons turbine concept remains largely unchanged even if the world around it has steam dreams throughout the 20 th and into the current century electricity generation has depended on steam power be it in a coal nuclear or biomass power plant heating water into highly pressurised steam is at the core of production greek mathematician and inventor hero of alexandria is cited as building the first ever steam engine of sorts with his aeolipile  which used steam to spin a hollow metal sphere but it wasnt until the 18 th century when english ironmonger thomas newcomen designed an  albeit inefficient  engine to pump water out of flooded mines that steam became a credible power in industry scottish engineer james watt from whose name the unit of energy comes from built on these humble beginnings and turned steam into the power behind the industrial revolution around 1764 when he added an condensing chamber to newcomens original design  it was the combination of this engine with thomas edisons electrical generator late in the 19 th century that first made largescale electricity production from steam a reality the turbine takes over steam engines and steam power was not a new concept when parson began his explorations in the space in fact nor were steam turbines others had explored ways to use streams velocity to spin blades rather than using its pressure to pump pistons in turn allowing rotors to spin at much greater speeds while requiring less raw fuel what made parsons design so important was its ability to keep rotational speeds moderate while also extracting as much kinetic energy from steam jets as possible he explained in a 1911 rede lecture that this was done by splitting up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series which ensured there was no one place the velocity of the blades was too great the designs strength was also apparent at scale in 1900 his company which was eventually acquired by siemens  was building turbinegenerator units capable of producing 1000 kw of electricity by 1912 however the company was installing a 25000 kw unit for the city of chicago parsons would live to see units reach 50000 kw and become the primary source of electricity generation around the world turbines in the modern grid the world is a vastly different place to the one in which parson designed his turbine yet the fundamentals of his concept have changed very little the results of what they achieve and the scales at which they work however have increased significantly today the turbines that make up draxs six generating units are each capable of producing more than 600 mw or 6000000 kw of electricity with the shape materials and arrangement of blades carefully designed to maximise efficiency and while that first design was purely with steam in mind turbine technology has advanced beyond dependency on a single power source and has been developed to accommodate for the shift towards lowercarbon power sources one such example is gas turbines which work by sucking in air through a compressor which is then heated by burning natural gas in turn spinning a turbine as it expands these can jump into action much faster than other turbines as they dont require any steam to be created to power them renewable sources such as hydro and wind power also depend on spinning turbines to generate electricity where these differ from gas or steampowered turbines is that rather than being encased in metal and blasted with gases wind and hydro turbines blades are exposed so flowing air or water can spin them powering a generator in turn turbine technology helped bring access to electricity around the world but the ingenuity and flexibility of the design means it is now serving to adapt electricity production for the postcoal age tags turbines  history  engineering  power station  technology drax a rail history 5 july 2018 power generation railways in great britain today are often seen as unreliable or chaotic yet they remain a vital part of the lives of the population and the economy of the country when rail transport first arrived in earnest in the 19 th century it suddenly allowed goods from around the world as well as people to quickly cross the country it reshaped perceptions of the countrys geography unlocked the population and accelerated industries over time however the role of the railways has diminished owing largely to the massive rise in car ownership and the shifting of freight onto the road but that is not to say it has completely lost its importance with 6000 trains passing through drax power station every year rail is still integral to drax and the region around it in fact since the very first introduction of the railways to the region it has played a major part in shaping the landscape a village with two stations before the construction of the power station or nationalisation of the railways drax village was wellconnected with two different railway lines running through it the north eastern railway ner selby to goole line and the hull and barnsley railways doncaster to hull line each of these lines ran through a different station with ner calling at drax hales station while hull and barnsley called at drax abbey station but following nationalisation and british rails modernisation plans drax abbey station which had closed to passengers in 1931 closed to goods traffic in 1959 drax hales station followed suit in 1964 when it was closed as part of what became known as the beeching axe british rail chairman richard beeching famously carried out a review of britains railways in the 60s and as a result closed vast quantities of  what he considered  uneconomical lines explains andrew christian fgd  byproducts section head at drax power station and expert on the areas history at that time oil was cheap people were increasingly using cars and motorways were being constructed nobody really foresaw the rail demand that would be needed in the future to serve the power station daleks on a merrygoround in the 1960s and 70s with the planning and construction of drax power station underway there was a new need for railways in bringing coal from the new selby coalfield this resulted in the reopening of a closed part of the hull and barnsley line for four miles from a reinstated junction at hensall known as hensall junction it was renamed drax power station branch junction and later shorted to drax branch junction a rail system known as a mgr loop was installed on the power station grounds which allows trains to loop around the station and deposit coal  today also wood pellets  without stopping the merrygoround trains as they are known were originally made up of 40 fourwheeled merrygoround mgr hopper wagons these were much smaller than the wagons that carry biomass from ports to power stations today and more than 11000 mgrs where built to serve coal power stations around great britain photo by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power station the opentopped wagons were each capable of carrying 33 tonnes of pulverised coal which was automatically released thanks to a piece of machinery alongside the track colloquially known as daleks thanks to their resemblance to the dr who villain but as the power station began to change and evolved to fit the modern world so too did the railway serving it rail at drax beyond coal  the original drax rail loop was a single track with three coal unloading points by 1993 there was 145 km of track with 27 sets of points and crossings allowing trains to switch rails thanks to the double tracked loop and extra tracks laid to serve traffic taking limestone in and gypsum out from the power station this was further expanded with the introduction of biomass and a new double track and unloading facility in 2013 the biomass trains are specially designed to keep compressed wood pellets dry and they are much longer than their mgr predecessors at 182 meters long their capacity is 30 greater than a coal wagon it means the 23wagon trains bringing biomass to the power stations from tyne hull immingham and liverpools ports are a quarter of a mile long it might be a far cry from the heyday in which the railways crisscrossed the region but they remain a vital part of the area and while the areas original lines are now 50 years dormant their remnants are still visible in the lasting impact theyve left on the surrounding landscape many of the embankments and bridges found in and around drax stem from those first railway lines while much of the a645 road that was constructed in the early 1990s runs along the track bed

an airship massive and slow moving it makes its way across skies its a far cry from what weve come to expect from the speed and innovation of todays air transport but go back a century and airships were not only the height of technology they were also a key part of britains aerial war effort part of this innovation can be traced back to the yorkshire village of barlow which was the site of a factory that built the vessels during the first world war three rigedstructure airships where constructed and took flight during the factorys history and this october marks the centenary of the first airship flight at the site in 1917 this is the story of how a stretch of land by the small yorkshire village near selby became the frontline for innovation in british military aviation the admiralty marches in during the first world war the german zeppelin fleet posed a very real threat to the people of britain more reliable than the aeroplanes of the time hydrogenfilled airships ability to hold heavy loads and remain airborne for periods of 20plus hours allowed them to carry out strategic bombing campaigns while the actual effectiveness of these raids on the uk mainland remains questionable the psychological impact of the zeppelins abilities to attack uk cities pushed the military to respond in early 1916 at the request of the admiralty the armstrongwhitworth airship department was formed to build zeppelinstyle aircraft to set about constructing the airship armstrongwhitworth acquired a large area of ground in barlow village within six months of the initial admiralty instructions the airship shed was completed it was the start of a century of industrial innovation in the area changing the area up until the beginning of the 20 th century barlow was almost exclusively agricultural but the construction of the selbygoole railway line changed that it suddenly connected the area as never before and enabled armstrongwhitworth to establish the 880acre airship facility along with a 700foot shed the site also included workshops offices living quarters for the workers and managers and eight huge mooring blocks for the airships it was an immediate change to the landscape but it had a greater impact than just its physical footprint between 1911 and 1951 barlow saw a 36 population increase  thought to be a result of the new military presence the first world war also began to change the demographics of the area with more than 2 million men conscripted into the army during the conflict women began to take up the traditionally maleheld industrial jobs when the war ended in november 1918 armstrongwhitworth employed 1500 people  over 1000 of those were women the airships take flight four airships were constructed over barlows lifetime as a military facility three of which made it to the air 25r the 25r first took flight on 14 october 1917 but it encountered problems from the start in the same manner as its predecessor the 23r  the craft did not have enough lift in trials subsequently dynamos bomb gear and furniture where stripped out to reduce the weight enabling the ship to make its first flight despite later stability issues the 25r served between december 1917 and september 1919 clocking up more than 221 hours of flight time and covering almost 9500 kilometres r29 armstrongwhitworths next aircraft would prove to be one of britains most successful rigedframed airships commissioned on 20 june 1918 the r29 flew for 335 hours and covered more than 13000 kilometres in its fivemonth operational career during this time the r29 encountered german uboats on three occasions while the first escaped the second struck a mine when pursued by the airship the r29 attacked and destroyed a third uboat off the coast of northumberland in september 1918 dropping two 100 kilogram bombs on the ub115 submarine and recording the only success of any british wartime riged airship r33 designs for the r33 were well underway by september 1916 when the german l33 zeppelin was brought down in essex while on a londonbombing raid despite the crews efforts to destroy the airship it fell into british hands virtually intact offering a trove of potential secrets adapted with the information learned from the downed l33 the r33 was eventually completed after the november 1918 armistice but nevertheless went on to operate for 10 years  longer than any other british riged airship httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201710r33plane_2_mp4 used with the kind permission of the airship heritage trust taking flight for the first time on 6 march 1919 the r33 was initially used to promote victory bonds around the country before being demilitarised famously the r33 was torn from its mast at pulham in a gale and blown out over the north sea  it took a partial crew 28 hours to eventually steer the damaged airship back to pulham from military camp to nature reserve following the first world war the land around barlow was sold off to civilian firms until 1938 when the thennamed war department took over the area to set up an army ordnance and command supply depot by the 60s however the uks need for military manufacturing had reduced instead with increasing demand for power and rich coal seams found there  barlow and the surrounding area became the site of what would become the uks biggest power station drax construction of drax power station began

here from the north sea via the regions ouse and aire rivers but it wasnt until 1086 that it received its first recorded mention when it was listed as berlaileag in the domesday book translating to a clearing where barley grew it was named by anglo saxon settlers who established the region as a mix of farmland fields and woodlands and it remained agricultural until the early twentieth century when the country was plunged into war when the first world war began in 1914 and the need for new war machines arose sir w g armstrong whitworth  co ltd a manufacturing company which had obtained the land in 1913 from the estate of lord londesborough set up an airship factory on the site during its lifetime the factory constructed three airships the 25r r29 and r33 but when wwi ended and demand for airships sank the factory shut down and the land passed to the ministry of defence mod during the second world war the area became an important location in the countrys war efforts once again the mod set up an army ordnance and command supply depot manufacturing and storing items like mess tins and kerosene lamps at one point the site also included a prisoner of war camp by the 60s the uks needs for defence manufacturing had subsided instead what it needed was more power with the rich coal seams of the area and the existing rail network the hullbarnsley line ran through building a power station in the barlow area was an obvious solution  firstofakind solution in 1967 the land was bought by the central electric generating board cegb which began the construction of drax power station one of the early challenges it faced was how to minimise the environmental impact to the surrounding countryside in particular it needed a solution for the tonnes of ash that came from the burning of coal fuel which included both pulverised fuel ash pfa and furnace bottom ash fba the answer was a firstofakind build a mound using the materials construction on barlow mound began in 1974 first the existing top soil was removed and preserved for later use drains were added and then a layer of fba was laid next conditioned pfa was added and moulded to suit the original design never reaching higher than 36 metres at this height the mound would visually obscure the power station from the neighbouring houses the final step was to seal the mound with a polymer and then reintroduce the top soil before grass trees and hedgerow were planted the trees and plants had been carefully tested to ensure that their roots wouldnt interfere with the ash and compromise the integrity of the structure an ecologically important area as time has passed and drax power station has produced more ash the mound has developed and grown more than 301 million m 3 is stored in the current site  more than the capacity of three million double decker buses in addition to the 100 species living on the site a tenant farmer works 20 fields and a swan rescue and wildlife hospital rehabilitates up to 2000 birds a year more recently the skylark centre and nature reserve has now opened up the area to the public to explore walking trails and see the nature firsthand barlow is an area that has changed consistently since 1086 from the norths early beginnings as an agricultural hub and anglosaxon settlement to the necessity for largescale power solutions and to the importance of preserving local ecology barlow is an area that has been characterised by the outlook of the country like drax power station to which it is intrinsically linked barlow mound is a part of the northern yorkshire landscape  literally and figuratively tags sustainability  power station  coal  history  visit us  nature reserve the turbulent history of coal 2 november 2016 power generation 9 may 2019 update we have updated this story to mark the new gb record of continuous coalfree hours since 1882 3490 bc households in china work out how to use coal for heat the coal was bulky to transport so settlements near forests probably burned it less often than wood  4 th century bc greek scientist theophrastus makes a reference to coal as a fuel in his treatise  on stones  2 nd century ad by the 2 nd century ad the romans were using coal from most of the main coalfields in britain archaeologists have found flint axes from before the roman era still embedded in coal there is evidence that at this time people dug up coal on beaches then followed the seam of coal inland encouraging them to investigate more sophisticated ways to mine it first millennium although its hard to date them precisely early mines called bell pits  deep holes which tapered outward at the bottom like a bell to provide a bigger surface area for mining  began to appear in the early part of the first millennium these were lit by large candles burning animal fat and were dangerous rocks could fall onto the miners and sometimes the pit would collapse entirely 13 th and 14 th centuries room and pillar mines emerged as larger more sophisticated versions of bell pits in these pillars of coal were left standing to support the roof 16 th century from the 1500s mining expanded significantly at this time coal was mostly used for heat by less welloff people one observer wrote in 1587 that old men told him about the multitude of chimneys lately erected whereas in their young days there were not above two or three if so many in most uplandish towns of the realm 1700 great britain was producing 27 million tonnes of coal per year mostly for use in metal production 1750 in just half a century britain ramps up coal production it was producing 47 million tonnes of coal per year 1763 to 1775 james watt develops his steam engine which was used to drain mines despite this flooding remained a problem 1800 by the turn of the nineteenth century great britain was producing 10 million tonnes of coal driven by the rising demand of the industrial revolution from about 1800 miners began to leave timber supports in place to hold up the roof of their pits allowing them to follow coal seams deep into the earth this was known as longwall mining 1815 sir humphrey davy invents his safety lamp it had a wire gauze around it so the flame would not encounter any gas and cause explosions it became known as the miners friend 1850 great britain was producing 50 million tonnes of coal 1882 the worlds first steam driven power station was built on coal at holborn viaduct in london it had a 27 tonne generator enough to light 1000 lamps later it was expanded to power 3000 a second coalfired power station opened later that year in the united states at pearl street station in new york city it initially served a load of 400 lamps and 82 customers but by 1884 it was powering more than 10000 lamps 1900 great britain was producing 250 million tonnes of coal 1947 all great british coal mines were nationalised bought by the government and placed under the control of the national coal board  1974 after the selby coalfield was discovered in 1967 drax power station was opened  1988 drax became the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions 1994 from the eighties onwards many coal mines closed and in 1994 british coal the successor to the national coal board was privatised 2004 as a result of uk mine closures and proposed emissions regulations coming into force from 2008 power stations started to increase the amount of coal they imported drax power stations supply was initially split between 50 indigenous coal and 50 imported there was a steadily increasing emphasis on imports for the decade thereafter 2008 the large combustion plant directive lcpd came into force across the eu limiting emissions of so 2  nox and particulates 2009 the drax team successfully adapted the boilers of the plant to combust wood pellets  this was proof that a coalfired power plant could be converted to biomass march 2013 the white rose carbon capture and storage ccs project was announced as one of two preferred bidders in the uks 1bn ccs competition this project looked to build a new 448 mwe coalfired power station with ccs capabilities on the existing drax power station site in yorkshire with ccs technology installed the power station would be able to capture and safely store carbon emissions underground rather than releasing them into the atmosphere 1st april 2013 the carbon price floor was launched in the uk a tax on carbon dioxide co 2  emissions it is designed to provide an incentive to invest in lowcarbon power generation september 2015 due to reduced renewable subsidies drax withdrew from the white rose ccs project 18 th november 2015 the uk government announced its intention to close all unabated coalfired power stations by 2025 and restrict their usage from 2023 to meet the challenge of climate change drax aims to end its reliance on coal even quicker drax ceo dorothy thompson has talked about the possibility given the right support to have all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before  25 th november 2015 the uk government cancelled its 1bn competition for ccs technology 18 th december 2015 on this day the last large scale deep coal mine in great britain  kellingley in north yorkshire  closed uk producers were struggling to compete with lower priced lower nitrogen oxides nox emitting coal from oversees 1 st january 2016 the industrial emissions directive is enforced in the uk and the rest of the european union putting stricter limits on the amount of nox emitted into the atmosphere from this point on coal power stations can either limit their availability to generate electricity or invest to adapt their boilers and use emissions abatement technologies  may 2016 great britain saw its first day generating electricity without using any coal since the opening of the first uk power station in 1882 september 2016 drax and other energy companies write to the uk government in support of maintaining rather than scrapping the carbon price floor april 2017 the first coalfree 24hour period on great britains electricity system since 1882 april 2018 uk government minister claire perry announced drax had joined the powering past coal alliance  just three days after great britains fourth 24 hours free from the carbonintensive fuel may 2019 a new coalfree record for britains electricity system of 8 days 1 hour and 25 minutes present day drax power station is europes largest decarbonisation project four of its six electricity generation units now run exclusively on biomass  reducing carbon emissions by more than 80 currently 75 of its electricity per year is generated using renewable rather than fossil fuel the last two coal units could be turned off by 2023 tags power station  energy policy  coal  history the single biggest transformation of our century 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy at the turn of the millennium drax was facing a serious issue demand for electricity was high and increasing but so was the desire for sources of power that were less harmful to the environment than coal at that time draxs fuel to continue to meet demand in a cleaner and more sustainable way an alternative approach was needed drax had a legacy in this field  in 1988 it was the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions in the two decades that followed however the sustainability conversation moved beyond how to make coal cleaner instead the focus was finding a truly viable alternative fuel finding a new fuel in those early days the idea of converting a fully coalfired station to another fuel seemed outlandish to say the least we made a lot of peoples heads hurt with this project says drax strategic projects engineering manager jason shipstone no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going back then it was all about experimentation jim price alternative fuel manager at the time explains initially we found a few distressed cargos of wood pellets and sunflower husks that someone had ordered but didnt want we mixed that with coal at very low concentration price and his team found they could use the plantbased fuel alongside coal at low percentages without it detrimentally affecting the boilers it was a long way from being a new business model but it was a start they spent the next year working with willow wood a subsidized energy crop that proved difficult to turn into a fuel that could be used efficiently to power a boiler then in 2005 after building a prototype plant and finding a way to pulverise the willow into a fine powder  called wood flour  and combine it with coal dust the team hit its first key milestone it was able to power a drax boiler that was the eureka moment says price no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going a change in attitude the response to the success was immediate senior management support for the project had been in place from the beginning but now there was a change across the whole company people started to think maybe it can be done says price work continued on the project and  after more experiments  drax eventually settled on compressed wood pellets this form of biomass ultimately required investment in four vast storage domes that between them store 80000 tonnes of pellets then there was the issue of supply and delivery materials were sourced from the us shipped to the uk then freighted to the plant in specially designed covered train wagons each carrying up to 7600 tonnes everything else had to carry on as normal this had to be seamless we had to work the same as drax has always worked  reliable and available says shipstone jason shipstone drax strategic projects manager played an instrumental role in upgrading drax the final hurdle in 2009 the team overcame one of the final challenges and successfully adapted the boilers to combust the new fuel proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels powering one boiler  in this case wood pellets and coal could work it was enough to show there was a future in wood pellets and it could work at scale although nothing was fully built yet but dorothy thompson ceo of drax was convinced shipstone remembers the conversation after thompson signed the contract to begin the transition in earnest so we can do 10 what does it take to get to 50 she asked recalls shipstone his response no problem it was the right answer he says toward a coalfree future fast forward to 2016 and drax is europes largest decarbonisation project  reducing emissions by at least 80 of the 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that the three now converted former coal generation units would have released per year although only half of draxs six units have been upgraded from coal to use compressed wood pellets  65 of the electricity generated at the power station is the result of a renewable rather than a fossil fuel its three biomass units produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes  or more than half of all residential properties in northern england given the challenges the world faces regarding the future of energy production decisive action is required if were to meet carbon reduction targets in the uk the government has voiced ambitions of phasing out coal by 2025 drax has aims of doing it quicker thompson has spoken of plans that see all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before the story of energy since the dawn of the industrial revolution has been one of fossil fuels this simply has to change by finding a way to ease the transition away from coal drax is helping to write the next chapter tags technology  power station  engineering  wood pellets  history name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up
