heights dont do this job 27 october 2016 power generation be they for nuclear coal or biomass power cooling towers and their colossal tapering silhouettes are the most iconic element of the architecture of energy drax has 12 of them but a structure of that size poses a considerable maintenance challenge for the first time since draxs six towers were constructed between 1967 and 1974  one of them was in need of repair what could possibly go wrong no matter how well you build something things can go wrong after more than five decades of continuous operation each tower is made from concrete that varies in thickness from seven inches in the middle to around 15 inches at the top and bottom over time even a structure this solid can begin to weaken cooling towers are reinforced with steel bars embedded within their concrete which can rust and expand causing the concrete around it to crack  a process called spalling water vapour which passes through the towers on an almost constant basis can also migrate into poorly compacted concrete inside the tower and cause further cracks before the drax team could set about repairing the towers they needed to know where these cracks were inspecting a structure that tall needed an innovative solution it needed drones surveying the damage drones were used to make a comprehensive photographic record of the towers that could be inspected for signs of damage the drones also helped produce a 3d model of the structure to visualise the towers defects it was the firstofakind for the company the drone survey found that on tower 3b there were a number of cracked concrete patches on the towers that needed repairing and maintenance was scheduled to coincide with draxs 2016 outages  periods during the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the power station undergo routine repair work the next challenge was how to carry out these repairs on a structure taller than the statue of liberty to inspect the cooling tower drax created a 3d model with the help of cyberhawk  engineering at an altitude drax tower 3b is nearly 115 metres tall enough to fit in the statue of liberty or st pauls cathedral with room to spare how do you go about repairing a structure like this the answer steeplejacks steeplejacks were called so because originally they were the people used for scaling the side of church steeples to make repairs but a cooling tower presents a distinctly different structure that cant necessarily be climbed up from the bottom to scale it and make the repairs a different approach was needed drax reached out to specialist steeplejack contractors zenith structural access  who build devices that allow the scaling of industrialscale structures zeniths solution was to fix a metal frame to the top of the tower which then lowers a walkway suspended by strong metal cables down its side from a perch suspended from the top of tower 3b workmen were deployed to make the repairs  more than 100 metres above ground suspended in their cradles the teams sealed the surface of each crack and then injected resin to fix the cracks in the concrete shell where the concrete had spalled new specialist repair mortars were applied regular repairs with the identified defects on the tower fully repaired attention can now move on to others on site routine inspections using drones and binoculars have been planned to take place every three years these will monitor the condition of all the towers and allow for future maintenance to be planned in advance two more towers are already scheduled for repair in 2017s outages once again itll be case for engineering work at elevation tags biomass energy  technology  engineering  cooling tower  drax power station  visit us north yorkshire tops chart for renewable energy andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 8 april 2016 opinion a new survey from the green alliance and regen sw shows that selby in north yorkshire produces the most renewable energy of any area in england and wales as you can see drax s home tops the chart by a large margin thats because between three and four per cent of the uks electricity is generated from sustainable biomass here at drax power station weve already converted half the station to use compressed wood pellets that half of drax has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent as a result but theres so much more drax could do to help the uk get more coal off the grid and if the green alliances next data visualization pitted renewables against fossil fuels a renewableonly drax as our countrys biggest power station would give low carbon technologies an even bigger share than would be the case today drax can not only generate more renewable power ourselves but also help solar and wind power to cope with demand as some of the older coal gas and nuclear plant retire over the coming years moving towards a balanced mix of renewables including further biomass upgrades at drax could save bill payers billions of pounds found research carried out by nera and imperial college london this was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass the uk is already far below the european average when it comes to using wood for energy if the government made the right decision and levelled the playing field for biomass in the uk drax could help our country climb the table meet our national climate change targets more quickly and contribute to saving bill payers billions of pounds upgrading from coal to wood pellets is also ensuring drax group  which employs more than 1400 people  has a real future at the heart of the northern powerhouse however its not just for government to change the status quo  businesses have a role to play too many uk businesses have made firm commitments to limit and reduce their impact on the environment for all their use of energy is a critical area to consider and address some of the biggest electricity users such as thames water and manchester airport group are increasingly demanding renewable electricity drax groups haven power is proud to offer the only 100 guaranteed renewable electricity product in the market to businesses big and small perhaps thats what the green alliances next index could investigate  which businesses have taken practical steps towards a renewable future tags biomass energy  drax power station  electricity generation  yorkshire how to plug the electricity gap andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 26 january 2016 opinion by 2025 the uk will face a 4055 per cent gap between electricity supply and demand according to a report from the institute of mechanical engineers  the government has disputed imeches projection but its own forecasting suggests that uk electricity demand will be 19 higher in 2035 vs 2015  the alleged 2025 gap will be caused by the closure of coalfired power stations to meet targets for carbon reduction according to the imeche current plans to plug the gap by building new gasfired capacity are unrealistic it would require a staggering 30 new power stations to be planned and built from scratch within the next 10 years at drax we have already developed a solution we can do it quickly cheaply and safely in fact it would drastically reduce the time and money involved in building all of those 30 new gas power stations from scratch weve already adapted three of our coalfired generating units to use highdensity pellets made from compressed lowgrade wood and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk to do it in all around four or five per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are already being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax its an approach that could be adopted elsewhere in the country providing a huge contribution to plugging the electricity gap our highdensity compressed wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can bring about these changes in the time we have left given the right support within two or three years we could convert the remaining three units at drax power station to run on biomass wood pellets with all six units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 per cent of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025  long before new gasfired capacity could come on stream the costs involved would be dramatically lower too we invested around 650 million to convert three generating units develop a supply chain and build new storage at drax it is estimated that the equivalent in new combined cycle gas turbine power stations would cost more as it would be new rather than repurposed infrastructure energy hierarchy the imeche has developed an energy hierarchy listing five sustainabilityrelated priorities against which to judge any future energy strategy the two that focus on energy generation are a perfect fit in terms of coaltobiomass conversions at drax and lynemouth priority 3  utilisation of renewable sustainable resources high density compressed wood pellets are made from lowgrade wood sourced according to the highest levels of forestry conservation priority 5  utilisation of conventional resources as we do now using worldleading engineering skills and avoiding the need to build brand new power stations our coal units can be converted without the need for new national grid connections many of our european neighbours such as sweden and germany already use a far higher proportion of biomass to meet their energy needs catching up with the european average is the simplest quickest and most affordable way to avoid a shortfall between supply and demand predicted by 2015 tags biomass energy  technology  drax power station  1 2 3 4 5 name email comment sign up for updates
