power station drax receives 100th biomass cargo from dedicated us export facility drax has received the 100th cargo of sustainable biomass from its dedicated us export facility at the port of baton rouge in louisiana marking an important milestone in five years of its operation supplying the renewable fuel to the uks largest power station 6 april 2020 landmark shipment of biomass delivered as drax power station in north yorkshire continues to generate the electricity the uk needs during the covid19 crisis vessel arrives in the uk on the 5 th anniversary of the start of operations at a dedicated biomass export facility in the us south the port of greater baton rouge is the final deepwater port on the mississippi river and the closest to draxs three pellet plants in the us south in 2015 drax completed work on its export facility at the port to process and ship biomass to its power station in the uk ultrabulks mv ultra jaguar vessel carried 62846 tonnes of sustainable biomass from baton rouge to the uk for drax the cargo is enough fuel to generate electricity for around 13 million homes the landmark shipment which arrived at abps port of immingham on march 25 will help drax to continue to produce the electricity the uk needs during the covid19 crisis will gardiner drax group ceo said were very proud of what drax has achieved since we started using sustainable biomass instead of coal at the power station  by developing a global supply chain for sustainable biomass our operations support thousands of jobs and have delivered economic growth across the north of england and in the us south maintaining our supply chain so we can continue to generate the renewable electricity the country needs is all the more important right now as we continue to play a critical role in producing power to help the fight against covid19 our teams are working around the clock to keep generating the power the country needs baton rouge transit has shipped over 5 million tonnes of sustainable biomass to ports on the uks east and west coast in the five years since the first vessel was dispatched on april 6 th 2015 once in the uk the wood pellets are loaded on to bespoke biomass freight trains bound for drax power station in north yorkshire where they are used to generate the renewable electricity that millions of uk homes and businesses rely on drax biomass senior vice president matt white said in the past five years the team here at draxs baton rouge facility has gone from loading its first vessel with 20000 tonnes of sustainable wood pellets to the 100 th vessel which loaded almost 63000 tonnes the team did this while achieving an industryleading safety record underscoring its focus and commitment to the wellbeing of our employees we will continue to work around the clock to maintain consistent and reliable deliveries of sustainable biomass to drax power station  a critical national asset which supplies 12 of the uks renewable power this is especially important during the ongoing covid19 crisis we have plans and processes in place to ensure our key workers can continue to carry out their vitally important roles safely during the covid19 pandemic drax is working closely with its suppliers in north america and europe as well as partners in the rail freight sector and at port facilities in the us and uk to maintain a resilient supply chain amid the coronavirus pandemic the uk government has identified drax as critical national infrastructure this includes the infrastructure and logistics related to the transportation of biomass to the power station such as ports and rail the us federal government and most state and local authorities have made similar designations relating to biomass around two thirds of the 75 million tonnes of sustainable biomass drax uses each year comes from the us where drax owns and operates three pellet mills producing compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in louisiana arkansas and mississippi the pellets are sent by rail and truck from the plants in louisiana and mississippi to draxs baton rouge facility before being loaded onto ships for their transatlantic journey vessel loading sustainable biomass at draxs baton rouge export facility in the us draxs operations support around 5700 jobs throughout its supply chains across the north of england and help to generate 600m per year for the regions economy earlier in march drax received and unloaded the largest ever shipment of sustainable biomass from baton rouge as part of its regular supply chain deliveries in addition to its own wood pellet production drax also has agreements with a number of other suppliers in the us and elsewhere around the world including in canada the baltics and portugal as well as multiple trading relationships this gives the energy company greater flexibility in sourcing sustainable biomass ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e

editors notes baton rouge transit is operated by host terminals and has the capacity to process 24 million tonnes of sustainable biomass a year the 100 th cargo completed loading at the port of baton rouge in louisiana on march 6 and arrived at associated british ports immingham renewable fuels terminal on the uks east coast on march 25 immingham renewable fuels terminal on the uks east coast is part of draxs network of port and rail infrastructure that runs from coast to coast and includes capacity at the port of tyne hull and liverpool having import capacity at both east and west coast ports adds extra security and resilience to draxs supply chain and operations sustainable biomass is an important part of the uks longterm energy mix using sustainable biomass instead of coal at drax
