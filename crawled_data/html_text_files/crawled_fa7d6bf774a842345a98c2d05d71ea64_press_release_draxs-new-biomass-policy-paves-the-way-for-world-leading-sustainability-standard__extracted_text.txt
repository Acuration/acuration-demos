scientists and forestry experts have reported that draxs new sustainable biomass sourcing policy meets industryleading recommendations set out by the forestry commission as it strives to raise standards even higher 24 january 2020 an independent advisory board iab led by former uk government chief scientific adviser sir john beddington was appointed by drax in october when it published a strengthened sourcing policy to ensure the biomass it uses to produce 12 of britains renewable electricity meets the highest sustainability standards in its first report the iab has found that draxs sustainable biomass sourcing reflects the recommendations made by forest research  the research agency of the forestry commission which is widely considered to be the industry gold standard drax group ceo will gardiner said the work of the iab is vital in guiding and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i am reassured to know that our existing policies reflect the forestry commissions recommendations and well continue to work with the board to strive for greater excellence across our operations we recently announced our ambition to become the worlds first carbon negative company by using sustainable biomass with carbon capture and storage technology to achieve this we need to go further in our efforts to lead the world on biomass sustainability standards positively contributing to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate the iab also recommended consideration is given to a review of existing evidence on sustainable biomass to advance understanding among academics policy makers and environmental groups such a restatement of evidence would be aimed at fostering agreement amongst scientists and environmental groups on the role of sustainable biomass sharing information with third parties on draxs operations and using scientific evidence to identify points of agreement disagreement and areas which need further study the iabs chair john beddington said its a complex area to navigate and if some common ground based on the scientific evidence can be agreed it creates a framework to help ensure the right types of biomass are used which make the greatest contribution towards addressing the climate emergency the uks committee on climate change has said that biomass will play a critical role in achieving the uks 2050 net zero target the iab which meets twice a year will produce a written report of its conclusions and recommendations for drax after its meetings and a summary of these will be published on the drax website  the iab held its first meeting on november 15 2019 ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr email protected 07712 670 888 editors notes forest research 2018 biomass carbon impacts  report for the european climate foundation has been cited by a number of organisations including the uk committee on climate change in its biomass in a low carbon economy report drax set up the iab in 2019 alongside its new strengthened biomass sustainability policy which goes beyond existing regulations to ensure the companys biomass sourcing continues to improve with the latest science and best practice the restatement of the evidence the iab has suggested is an independently run process based on input from scientists with varying points of view consultation with industry nongovernmental organisations and policy makers sir john beddington also said in his letter to drax that the board wanted to explore how science regarding the use of early thinnings and small roundwood can further develop drax has initiated a programme of independent analysis on the environmental and economic impacts in the areas where it sources its wood it will be sharing this with the iab for its scrutiny and insight the iab acts as a forum for engagement between sustainable biomass experts and drax and is tasked to advise and give feedback on feedstock options sourcing decisions procurement practices forest science and forest carbon science the iab also advises on the role of biomass in draxs climate change mitigation activities and in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system as well as providing insight on societys expectations for responsible and sustainable biomass members of draxs independent advisory board are professor sir john beddington chair  former uk government chief scientific adviser professor lord john krebs vice chair  emeritus professor of zoology university of oxford and crossbench member of the house of lords virginia dale  adjunct professor university of tennessee professor sam fankhauser  director of the lse grantham institute elena schmidt  standards director roundtable on sustainable biomass forest research exofficio  a representative from forest research the uks primary organisation for forest science will also join the board in an exofficio capacity the board provides independent advice to drax on the role of biomass in draxs climate change mitigation activities and in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system feedstock options sourcing decisions forest science forest carbon science and how drax can optimise carbon impacts procurement practices societal expectations for responsible and sustainable biomass and gives feedback and recommendations on draxs sustainable biomass approach and performance more information on the board can be found here draxs biomass sourcing policy has four key commitments to reduce co 2 emissions to protect the natural environment to support people and communities to carry out research outreach and intervention more information on draxs biomass sourcing policy can be found here in december drax published the first in a series of independent reports on the environmental and economic impacts in the areas where it sources its wood hood consultings report highlighted the positive role the amite bioenergy pellet plant has had in the region supporting the health of western mississippis forests and its economy about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk share related stories press releases drax
