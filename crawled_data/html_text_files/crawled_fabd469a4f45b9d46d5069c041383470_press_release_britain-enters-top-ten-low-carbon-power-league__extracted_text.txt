britain enters top ten low carbon power league 15 november 2017 britains electricity is now the 7 th cleanest climbing 13 places in the global rankings carbon price floor has driven unparalleled co 2 reductions britains emissions from electricity almost halved 47 between 201216 based on the findings drax calls on chancellor to maintain carbon price in budget britains electricity is now amongst the cleanest in the world  having moved 13 places up the global rankings to be placed 7 th in terms of the carbon content of its electricity among large and industrialised countries according to the latest electric insights report produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax britains shift was the biggest for any country in the league table the most any other country moved was eight places and this was by the netherlands in the opposite direction  down the leaders table the analysis shows that the uks carbon price has helped deliver unparalleled carbon reductions  its charge on greenhouse gas emissions has driven uptake in renewables and a shift away from coal to gasfired power generation dr iain staffell from imperial college london explained since we started electric insights a year ago we have seen a number of firsts across the power sector and this quarter is no different  britain has entered the worlds top ten low carbon power league for the first time britain is reducing its carbon emissions from electricity faster than any other major country and this has happened because the carbon price and lower gas prices have forced coal off the system  the amount of coalfired power generation in britain has fallen 80 between 2012 and 2016 in the netherlands coalfired electricity output has risen 40 over the same period as generators only have to pay the much lower european carbon price the carbon price floor is set by the uk government power generators in the uk are charged 23 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  produced compared to 5 per tonne in europe the six countries with lower carbon electricity than britain benefit from substantial hydropower resources or in the case of france a heavy reliance on nuclear andy koss drax power ceo said the analysis by dr staffell and the team at imperial college london shows quite clearly the impact britains carbon price has had in terms of helping to ensure we produce cleaner power for the uks homes and businesses its therefore vital that we maintain a meaningful carbon price when the chancellor announces the autumn budget if we are to meet our commitments on climate change without it we could see a reversal of the impressive results achieved so far  look at whats happened elsewhere britains carbon emissions from electricity almost halved 47 between 201216 and the carbon impact of britains electricity has fallen more than twice as fast as any other major economy new coal power stations were built in the netherlands between 2013 and 2016 leading to a dramatic increase in their coal consumption and carbon emissions drax has upgraded half of its power station in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass transforming it to become the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe the report has been shared with hm treasury as further evidence to support carbon pricing ahead of the autumn budget on 22 november 2017 country comparisons norway sweden and france have the cleanest power systems among large and industrialised countries due to their mountainous terrain allowing for substantial hydropower resources and a heavy reliance on nuclear in france with 58 reactors india and south africa have the dirtiest power sectors on the list with 7590 of their power generated by coal figure 1 local carbon electricity
