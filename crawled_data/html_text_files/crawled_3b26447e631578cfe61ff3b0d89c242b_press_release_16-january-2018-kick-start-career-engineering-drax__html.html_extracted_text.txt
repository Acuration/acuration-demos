Kick start a career in engineering at Drax
Having upgraded half of the power station from coal to use renewable biomass, nearly 70% of the power produced at Drax Power Station, is now renewable – enough for four million households.
16 January 2018
Budding engineers can apply for an apprenticeship at Drax through its Technical Apprenticeship Scheme which is now open.
The scheme offers successful candidates the chance to learn a trade, develop new skills and launch their career in engineering at the UK’s biggest power station and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Having upgraded half of the power station from coal to use renewable biomass, nearly 70% of the power produced at Drax Power Station, is now renewable – enough for four million households.
Drax is looking for six technical craft apprentices who will be trained in engineering to work within the maintenance department at Drax Power Station. They will work on new and recently upgraded plant designed to process renewable fuels and the maintenance of the power station.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“For anyone wanting to start their career in engineering, it doesn’t get much better than learning their trade at the UK’s biggest power station.
“It’s an exciting time to join Drax – as well as having upgraded half of the power station to use sustainable biomass, we’re also developing four rapid response gas power projects, exploring options for repowering two of our remaining coal generating units to gas and developing large-scale battery storage.”
He added: “An apprenticeship is a brilliant way to start a career in engineering. We’ve got lots of successful former apprentices working at Drax Power Station – there are engineers, section heads and department managers who all started out as apprentices.
“In order to attract the best people for the roles we hope to appeal to a diverse range of candidates from all backgrounds and would encourage anyone with an interest to apply.”
Tom Glennon-Fell, a third year technical apprentice based at Drax Power Station said: “The Drax Apprenticeship Scheme has given me the best chance to go far and be successful in my career by learning and getting hands on experience at Drax.
“I’m in my third year as an apprentice and really enjoy the variety of work I do, on a day to day basis working with some of the most experienced and knowledgeable people in the power sector.”
The Drax Apprenticeship Training Scheme is a four year programme, with each apprentice spending the first two years training in Loughborough, where travel and accommodation is provided.
In the third and fourth years, apprentices will be primarily based at Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire with places available in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.
Applications for the Technical Apprenticeship Scheme in 2018 are now being accepted and will close on 31
st
January 2018.
Drax will also be offering other apprenticeships over the course of the year in business support areas, such as Finance and Business Administration. All opportunities are advertised on the website at
