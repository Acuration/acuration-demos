decarbonisation 5 march 2021 sustainable business in october last year several of our employees from policy managers to apprentices took over the energy uk young energy professional yep forums twitter

technical apprentices samuel plumb explains why he decided to kickstart his career with a drax apprenticeship plus what the selection process involves i applied for this role because its a mix of practical skills and problemsolving drax has a large site with a huge range of equipment and processes so no two days are the same working here appealed to me because im really interested in the power industry and drax plays a key role in generation i found out about this apprenticeship through online research submitted an application completed aptitude tests online sat another aptitude test onsite and then eventually attended an interview meet richard the policy manager richard gow explains that with the right policies in place drax could become a carbon negative power station enabling a zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region the drax group policy and government relations manager outlines how his role helps to develop the necessary frameworks i engage with policymakers advisors and experts across the uk to understand the policy and political landscape and how this could impact draxs commercial objectives the energy sector is at the forefront of decarbonisation and its exciting to be involved in developing policies and market frameworks to support this transition to net zero by investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen and other green technologies in the humber industry can regain a competitive edge new jobs can help to rejuvenate communities and the wider region as evidenced by a recent report from vivid economics on the socioeconomic benefits of beccs this investment at drax supports the uks levelling up agenda and to build back better  emphasising the need for the uk to have a skilled workforce to achieve net zero

renewables engagement officer describes her motivations for joining the clean energy transition and how her role is helping to ensure the uk reaches its net zero target as a recent graduate with a masters in energy and society i wanted to work in the energy sector and be part of its real and current transition to mitigating climate change instead of contributing to it this is an exciting time and my part in this transformation involves stakeholder engagement and contributing to draxs climate policy to ensure we reach our carbon negative ambition by developing talent within schools from a young age and inspiring students to study science technology engineering and maths stem subjects drax also encourages future career opportunities we are proud to be working with a number of local schools and colleges such as selby college with whom we recently signed a new fiveyear partnership  this shows our continued commitment to ensuring students of all ages are equipped with the skills
