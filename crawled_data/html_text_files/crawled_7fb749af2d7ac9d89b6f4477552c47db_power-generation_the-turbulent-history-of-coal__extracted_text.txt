turbulent history of coal from the worlds most important power source to one of its most polluting coal has had a varied and interesting history 2 november 2016 power generation 9 may 2019 update we have updated this story to mark the new gb record of continuous coalfree hours since 1882 3490 bc households in china work out how to use coal for heat the coal was bulky to transport so settlements near forests probably burned it less often than wood  4 th century bc greek scientist theophrastus makes a reference to coal as a fuel in his treatise  on stones  2 nd century ad by the 2 nd century ad the romans were using coal from most of the main coalfields in britain archaeologists have found flint axes from before the roman era still embedded in coal there is evidence that at this time people dug up coal on beaches then followed the seam of coal inland encouraging them to investigate more sophisticated ways to mine it first millennium although its hard to date them precisely early mines called bell pits  deep holes which tapered outward at the bottom like a bell to provide a bigger surface area for mining  began to appear in the early part of the first millennium these were lit by large candles burning animal fat and were dangerous rocks could fall onto the miners and sometimes the pit would collapse entirely 13 th and 14 th centuries room and pillar mines emerged as larger more sophisticated versions of bell pits in these pillars of coal were left standing to support the roof 16 th century from the 1500s mining expanded significantly at this time coal was mostly used for heat by less welloff people one observer wrote in 1587 that old men told him about the multitude of chimneys lately erected whereas in their young days there were not above two or three if so many in most uplandish towns of the realm 1700 great britain was producing 27 million tonnes of coal per year mostly for use in metal production 1750 in just half a century britain ramps up coal production it was producing 47 million tonnes of coal per year 1763 to 1775 james watt develops his steam engine which was used to drain mines despite this flooding remained a problem 1800 by the turn of the nineteenth century great britain was producing 10 million tonnes of coal driven by the rising demand of the industrial revolution from about 1800 miners began to leave timber supports in place to hold up the roof of their pits allowing them to follow coal seams deep into the earth this was known as longwall mining 1815 sir humphrey davy invents his safety lamp it had a wire gauze around it so the flame would not encounter any gas and cause explosions it became known as the miners friend 1850 great britain was producing 50 million tonnes of coal 1882 the worlds first steam driven power station was built on coal at holborn viaduct in london it had a 27 tonne generator enough to light 1000 lamps later it was expanded to power 3000 a second coalfired power station opened later that year in the united states at pearl street station in new york city it initially served a load of 400 lamps and 82 customers but by 1884 it was powering more than 10000 lamps 1900 great britain was producing 250 million tonnes of coal 1947 all great british coal mines were nationalised bought by the government and placed under the control of the national coal board  1974 after the selby coalfield was discovered in 1967 drax power station was opened  1988 drax became the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions 1994 from the eighties onwards many coal mines closed and in 1994 british coal the successor to the national coal board was privatised 2004 as a result of uk mine closures and proposed emissions regulations coming into force from 2008 power stations started to increase the amount of coal they imported drax power stations supply was initially split between 50 indigenous coal and 50 imported there was a steadily increasing emphasis on imports for the decade thereafter 2008 the large combustion plant directive lcpd came into force across the eu limiting emissions of so 2  nox and particulates 2009 the drax team successfully adapted the boilers of the plant to combust wood pellets  this was proof that a coalfired power plant could be converted to biomass march 2013 the white rose carbon capture and storage ccs project was announced as one of two preferred bidders in the uks 1bn ccs competition this project looked to build a new 448 mwe coalfired power station with ccs capabilities on the existing drax power station site in yorkshire with ccs technology installed the power station would be able to capture and safely store carbon emissions underground rather than releasing them into the atmosphere 1st april 2013 the carbon price floor was launched in the uk a tax on carbon dioxide co 2  emissions it is designed to provide an incentive to invest in lowcarbon power generation september 2015 due to reduced renewable subsidies drax withdrew from the white rose ccs project 18 th november 2015 the uk government announced its intention to close all unabated coalfired power stations by 2025 and restrict their usage from 2023 to meet the challenge of climate change drax aims to end its reliance on coal even quicker drax ceo dorothy thompson has talked about the possibility given the right support to have all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before  25 th november 2015 the uk government cancelled its 1bn competition for ccs technology 18 th december 2015 on this day the last large scale deep coal mine in great britain  kellingley in north yorkshire  closed uk producers were struggling to compete with lower priced lower nitrogen oxides nox emitting coal from oversees 1 st january 2016 the industrial emissions directive is enforced in the uk and the rest of the european union putting stricter limits on the amount of nox emitted into the atmosphere from this point on coal power stations can either limit their availability to generate electricity or invest to adapt their boilers and use emissions abatement technologies  may 2016 great britain saw its first day generating electricity without using any coal since the opening of the first uk power station in 1882 september 2016 drax and other energy companies write to the uk government in support of maintaining rather than scrapping the carbon price floor april 2017 the first coalfree 24hour period on great britains electricity system since 1882 april 2018 uk government minister claire perry announced drax had joined the powering past coal alliance  just three days after great britains fourth 24 hours free from the carbonintensive fuel may 2019 a new coalfree record for britains electricity system of 8 days 1 hour and 25 minutes present day drax power station is europes largest decarbonisation project four of its six electricity generation units now run exclusively on biomass  reducing carbon emissions by more than 80 currently 75 of its electricity per year is generated using renewable rather than fossil fuel the last two
