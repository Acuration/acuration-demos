is the carbon cycle everything you need to know about the carbon cycle 25 march 2022 carbon capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million tonnes of co 2 every year go deeper can carbon
