sustainability sustainability certified 24 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy of all the changes to drax power station over the last decade perhaps the biggest is one you cant see since converting three of its six generating units from coal to run primarily on compressed wood pellets  drax has reduced those units greenhouse gas ghg emissions by over 80  and while this is a huge improvement it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isnt sustainably sourced  for this reason drax works with internationallyrecognised certification programmes that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental social and economic criteria thanks to these certification programmes drax can be confident it is not only reducing ghg emissions but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced sustainability certifications the compressed wood pellets used at drax power station come from various locations around the world so drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes the three main ones being the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council  fsc   1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc the programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management but adoption rates vary by region european landowners and regulators are most familiar with the fsc and national pefc standards while north american landowners generally prefer sfi and american tree farm system also members of the pefc family in instances in which drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications or in instances in which drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable over 50 of the pellets used at drax power station come from the southern usa  where sfi and american tree farm system are the most widely implemented certification programmes overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest however the sfi offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by woodprocuring entities such as sawmills pulp mills and pellet mills this programme is referred to as sfi fiber sourcing and to obtain it participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources these sources may or may not include certified forests the programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity water quality landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals together these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides drax with a significant proportion of its pellets and since the sfi and atfs programmes are endorsed by pefc north american suppliers have a pathway for their regions sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by european stakeholders these certification programmes have been in use for many years but with recent growth in the market for wood pellets a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass new kid on the block the sustainable biomass program sbp was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources but rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes it builds on them for example sbp recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes however the pefc sfi and fsc programmes do not include requirements for reporting ghg emissions a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to european regulators sbp fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets when a new entity such as a wood pellet manufacturer first seeks certification under sbp that entity is required to assess its supply base feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme sfi fsc   pefc or pefc approved schemes is considered sbpcompliant all other feedstock must be evaluated against sbp criteria and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 sbp indicators if during the process a specific risk is identified for example to the forest ecosystem the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded these assessments are audited by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee in conducting the risk assessment the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes sustainable energy for the uk counting major energy companies including dong energy eon and drax as members the sbp has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry at the end of 2016 the sbp had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries  including draxs pellet manufacturing arm drax biomass  in mississippi and louisiana its a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides drax with the assurance that it is powering the uk using biomass from legal and sustainable sources like the fastreducing carbon dioxide emissions of britains power generation sector  its a change you cant see but one that is making a big difference read the drax principles for sustainable

march 2017 sustainable bioenergy almost one third of the earths land mass is covered by forests thats an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy to celebrate the uns international day of forests  were looking at some of the reasons why forests and wood fuel are more powerful than you might think theyre a major source of renewable energy nearly half of the worlds renewable energy comes from forests in the form of wood fuel roughly 24 billion people around the world use it for things like cooking heating and generating electricity in fact about 50 of the total global wood production is currently used for these purposes however it is critical that this resource is managed sustainably and responsibly  one of the key aims of the international day of forests is to encourage people to utilise their local forest resources sustainably to ensure it endures for future generations they can revitalise economies because wood fuel is such a widely used energy source it also supports a healthy vibrant industry roughly 900 million people work in the wood energy sector globally  more than that rural economies built on wood energy can be revitalised by modernisation which can then stimulate local business  investment can help finance better forest management which in turn leads to forest growth improvements in sustainability standards and in some cases increased employment they can help mitigate climate change the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the global annual primary energy consumption which makes it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand in a sustainable and renewable way when wood is used as fuel it releases carbon dioxide co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or sustainable system of growing forests this carbon is offset by new tree plantings the only emissions produced therefore are the ones involved in transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predict that by 2030 forestry mitigation with the help of carbon pricing could contribute to reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes gt co 2 a year  tags biomass energy  sustainability  forests vikings airships and ash the history of barlow mound 10 january 2017 sustainable business barlow mound is a haven for wildlife more than 100 different species call it home including kingfishers roe deer and falcons its an area that looks like its never been touched by the industrialisation that surrounds it the truth is very different barlow mound is manmade it was built in the 1970s using residue material from its neighbour drax power station its a success story of using what was then considered a waste material to create something natural and beautiful but it has a long history before becoming what it is today and to explore that history is to track the outlook of the uk over the last millennium the military moves in the area around barlow and drax was an important location for the very first viking explorers who arrived here from the north sea via the regions ouse and aire rivers but it wasnt until 1086 that it received its first recorded mention when it was listed as berlaileag in the domesday book translating to a clearing where barley grew it was named by anglo saxon settlers who established the region as a mix of farmland fields and woodlands and it remained agricultural until the early twentieth century when the country was plunged into war when the first world war began in 1914 and the need for new war machines arose sir w g armstrong whitworth  co ltd a manufacturing company which had obtained the land in 1913 from the estate of lord londesborough set up an airship factory on the site during its lifetime the factory constructed three airships the 25r r29 and r33 but when wwi ended and demand for airships sank the factory shut down and the land passed to the ministry of defence mod during the second world war the area became an important location in the countrys war efforts once again the mod set up an army ordnance and command supply depot manufacturing and storing items like mess tins and kerosene lamps at one point the site also included a prisoner of war camp by the 60s the uks needs for defence manufacturing had subsided instead what it needed was more power with the rich coal seams of the area and the existing rail network the hullbarnsley line ran through building a power station in the barlow area was an obvious solution  firstofakind solution in 1967 the land was bought by the central electric generating board cegb which began the construction of drax power station one of the early challenges it faced was how to minimise the environmental impact to the surrounding countryside in particular it needed a solution for the tonnes of ash that came from the burning of coal fuel which included both pulverised fuel ash pfa and furnace bottom ash fba the answer was a firstofakind build a mound using the materials construction on barlow mound began in 1974 first the existing top soil was removed and preserved for later use drains were added and then a layer of fba was laid next conditioned pfa was added and moulded to suit the original design never reaching higher than 36 metres at this height the mound would visually obscure the power station from the neighbouring houses the final step was to seal the mound with a polymer and then reintroduce the top soil before grass trees and hedgerow were planted the trees and plants had been carefully tested to ensure that their roots wouldnt interfere with the ash and compromise the integrity of the structure an ecologically important area as time has passed and drax power station has produced more ash the mound has developed and grown more than 301 million m 3 is stored in the current site  more than the capacity of three million double decker buses in addition to the 100 species living on the site a tenant farmer works 20 fields and a swan rescue and wildlife hospital rehabilitates up to 2000 birds a year more recently the skylark centre and nature reserve has now opened up the area to the public to explore walking trails and see the nature firsthand barlow is an area that has changed consistently since 1086 from the norths early beginnings as an agricultural hub and anglosaxon settlement to the necessity for largescale power solutions and to the importance of preserving local ecology barlow is an area that has been characterised by the outlook of the country like drax power station to which it is intrinsically linked barlow mound is a part of the northern

2016 sustainable bioenergy this story was published the day before the announcement by the european commission please scroll to the bottom of this page for the drax view  when the european union set out its policy for the promotion of renewable energy in the 2009 renewable energy directive red it set a very ambitious target by 2020 renewables should make up 20 of the eus energy consumption each member state was given a specific goal and made to detail exactly how it would hit this the directive was comprehensive in many ways but it didnt include a clear sustainability policy for solid biomass including compressed wood pellets  as one of the largest sources of renewable energy in europe  this left a policy gap that many voices  including drax  have called to be filled its a wish that will now be granted a revised red is set to be published by the eu that will specify clear criteria for all biomass sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy but drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way dorothy thompson drax group ceo july 2014 importance of sustainable biomass biomass is a wellestablished and essential part of the renewable energy mix it offers a unique mix of reliability flexibility and affordability all while helping to deliver carbon reductions this makes it particularly important as countries like the uk seek to phase out coal generation and hit the targets set out in the paris agreement however in order to secure these carbon benefits biomass needs to be produced sustainably this means that it comes from responsiblymanaged growing forests and that the emissions from the supply chain are measured and minimised in the uk there are already binding sustainability criteria but this isnt the case across the eu biomass use in the uk is regulated under the eu timber regulations and uks own renewable obligation ro biomass sustainability criteria the ro is a form of government support designed to incentivise large scale renewable electricity generation in the uk and to qualify for this energy companies must adhere to sustainability standards such as properly accounting for their greenhouse gas ghg emissions and only sourcing from responsibly managed land and forests  an euwide approach to biomass that follows the uks could see the implementation of a riskbased scheme that asks large energy companies to prove how they mitigate against a set of identified risks  like those in the ro criteria however its important that compliance with these is independently verified  something that could be done by using independent schemes such as the sustainable biomass program sbp the sbp carries out supplybase evaluation of pellet producers to ensure the wood theyre using is qualified as sustainable and theyre meeting the ro criteria programmes like the sbp are already being used by most major biomass power generators in the eu and could act as a blueprint for the future efficiency where effective only a few of the power stations across the eu are suitable for conversion from coal to biomass but those that are like drax can deliver fast significant carbon savings the thermal efficiency of such stations may not be as high as a newly built plant but they do allow governments to quickly move away from coal more than that these plants can continue to provide the critical services  such as voltage control and black start  the grid needs to remain stable and that other renewables cant drax is one of these stations and in the first half of 2016 it was able to deliver around 20 of the uks renewable power thanks to its conversion to biomass it now does this with over 80 carbon reductions relative to coal with the abundance of suitable and sustainablygrown fibre that can be used for biomass electricity generation there is a strong case for the eu to encourage the coal phase out by encouraging others to undergo conversion from coal to biomass but whats also needed is a clear set of sustainability criteria for biomass  the move to define this is a step in the right direction but the final eu proposal needs to be a practical one if the updated red achieves this it will mean a bright future for renewable energy in europe and a clearer path for meeting the continents paris agreement targets  30 november 2016 update  drax welcomes renewable energy directive proposal drax welcomes the publication of the renewable energy directive and bioenergy policy proposal  drax has been at the forefront of calling for standards based on a riskassessment to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass used for energy production matt willey public affairs director of drax power had said that drax has campaigned for a robust pragmatic biomass sustainability policy for the whole eu for many years and today is a step in the right direction it is important that large users of biomass can demonstrate forest regeneration is taking place that areas of high conservation value are protected that soil and water quality is maintained and that harvesting does not exceed the longterm production capacity of the forest we welcome the fact the commission proposes that voluntary national or international schemes including those which use a risk based approach can be used to provide evidence of sustainability the uk already has the toughest sustainability rules in the world so drax can be sure our compressed wood pellets are sustainable but it makes sense to have a common policy across the eu drax power has made huge efforts to demonstrate the sustainability of its biomass  sourcing from regions with large surpluses combined with low wood paying capability drax is able to track and trace every shipment back to low risk areas which assures that biodiversity is protected and promotes sustainable forest management tags investors  energy policy  sustainable biomass program sbp  sustainability building a 21st century port 16 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy in its long history the port of liverpool has dealt with a number of industries its a port characterised by its ability to adapt to the needs of the time in 1715 it emerged as one of the worlds first ever wet docks in the 18 th century it was used as a hub for the slave trade when slavery was abolished in the early 19th century liverpool switched to bringing in the goods of the thriving empire such as cotton when goods like cotton dried up it switched to the fuel of the industrial revolution coal now as the world and the uk government moves away from fuels like coal and towards lowercarbon and renewable resources the port of liverpool needed to adapt once again gary hodgson chief operating officer at peel ports  explains about three years ago everyone was asking what happens after coal what happens after coal peel ports is one of the biggest operators of liverpools shipping infrastructure including liverpool port seeing that the future of coal was finite it recognised there was a need for a port that could bring in alternative renewable fuels at the same time drax was looking for a logistics partner to facilitate the importing of compressed wood pellets since 2009 drax power station had begun a process of upgrading its coalfired boilers to run on sustainable biomass sourced from huge wellestablished working forests  more than this it had plans to set up its own pellet manufacturing plants in the us south and needed to import large quantities of wood pellets the relationship with peel ports and liverpool was obvious this began a 100 million investment that helped transform the regions portstation transport infrastructure its about working in partnerships with companies says hodgson working this way helps develop solutions that really work the central element of the partnership between drax and peel ports was a radical redesigning of the technical infrastructure not only do compressed wood pellets have fundamentally different physical properties to other fuels like coal they are more combustible and need to be handled safely for the threemilliontonnecapacity facility that peel ports and drax wanted to build innovative supply chain solutions had to be developed shifting biomass in bulk the first challenge was getting the highdensity pellets off giant ships for this peel and drax designed a solution that uses an archimedean screw  a long tube with a spiral winding up the inside that allows liquids or materials that can behave like a liquid like wood pellets to defy gravity and travel upwards at the top of the screw the pellets are emptied onto a conveyor belt and carried to one of three purposebuilt silos tailored to safely storing thousands of tonnes of biomass  here the pellets wait until another conveyor belt deposits them onto speciallydesign biomass trains where they are transported across the peaks of the pennines to drax power station near selby in north yorkshire each step at the port is automated designed with supreme efficiency in mind by a team of drax and peel port engineers endtoend port to power station the whole process can take as little as 12 hours a new chapter for the north in the varied history of the port of liverpool the new facility is another chapter one that is helping transform the logistics infrastructure and the economic growth of the north west now open and operational the facility directly employs 50 people  around 500 additional contractors have worked on the project during its construction and development more than that its an investment in the countrys energy future it secures a fourth port for drax  three others are on the east coast  helping with security of supply we made this investment because we recognised this as the future of the energy mix of the country hodgson explain we cant just rely on one form of power  there has to be an energy mix and we see biomass as a key part of that tags ships and shipping  supply chain  sustainability  biomass energy forests sustainability and biomass  the experts view matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 6 october 2016 opinion it was a forestry catastrophe that first inspired matthew rivers interest in forests dutch elm trees an iconic part of the uk landscape for over 250 years were becoming infected with a fatal and fastspreading disease the race was on to save them a schoolboy in north london at the time rivers joined the after curricular school team tasked with saving its trees  first by injecting them with insecticide and when that didnt work by felling and replanting them it was an early foundation in how forests work and the challenges of keeping them healthy decades later rivers is director of corporate affairs at drax its a role he finds himself in following a career as a forester helping to manage forestry businesses and supporting the setting up of wood product manufacturing plants his own estimation of his working life is a humble one however i think im probably a failed farmer he says a forester always plants in hope rivers studied forestry at university in scotland before taking up jobs in the forestry industry across the uk uruguay and finland working in this industry he says is one that requires patience in the uk were talking about 30 or 40year growth cycles the trees i planted at the start of my career are only just coming to maturity now he explains but more than the long investment of time being a forester relies on faith a forester always plants in hope he says when a forester plants a tree he or she most commonly does not know who the end customer will be so when the call came from drax for a forestry expert to help guide the company through an important transformation  upgrading the power station from coal to biomass  the challenge was one he was ready to take drax already had ambitions of converting three boilers to run on biomass that would mean consuming tonnes of compressed wood pellets he says the business needed a supply and rivers was drafted in to set this up as part of the supply solution and chaired by rivers drax set up drax biomass  a pellet manufacturing business in the usa that makes and supplies compressed wood pellets to drax power station  setting up its own manufacturing plant not only means drax needs to rely on fewer external suppliers but also that it can use the learnings about the technologies the economics and the sourcing of the process to continually hone its supply chain to operate responsibly and receive governmental support drax has to be sustainable and this is particularly important when it comes to where and how it sources its fuel this comes with its own challenges no universal definition of sustainability to my understanding there is no universal definition of sustainability says rivers so how do you proof your business for an unclear entity at its heart sustainability is about not doing anything today that would prejudice doing the same thing for the next generation or generations to come a responsibly managed forest is one that is as healthy productive diverse and useful in 100 or 500 years time as it is today they key to this is to think of forests as a whole rivers explains think about a single tree  you fell it and use it to heat your home over one winter but its going to take perhaps 30 years for that tree to grow back he says what do you do for the next 30 years in a sustainably managed forest you have all different ages of tree represented  one thirtieth devoted to each age and when you use an older tree to warm you in winter you plant a replacement that way for every year youll have trees reaching maturity ready to provide your power its a cycle that if managed responsibly keeps delivering a useful resource as well as maintaining the health of the forest rivers continues sustainability is the very nature of what a forester does because if we dont take care of our forests and ensure we have a crop to harvest year after year we lose our livelihood becoming a private forester two decades ago rivers completed a loop he started decades ago amidst the dutch elm crisis and became a forest owner himself in scotland he bought and now manages his own private forest weve had kids birthday parties weve dug out a pond we harvest chanterelles in the autumn  theres a millennium capsule buried somewhere he says its not only a family heirloom its a place for him to exercise a passion  maintaining and managing a responsible and healthy forest tags biomass energy  sustainability  wood pellets  careers 5 things you never knew about forests sustainable bioenergy forests and the products we derive from them are one of the most ubiquitous aspects of human civilisation despite the rapid pace of modern life that isnt changing forest still covers 30 of the worlds land and in the uk more than an estimated 55 million m 3 of wood was used in 2015  either directly through furniture books or hygiene paper or indirectly in infrastructure like fences railways or through biomass electricity generation behind all this lies the forest and the industry surrounding it but how much do you really know about forests in some regions forests are increasing mention forestry and there are plenty of people who make the jump to the activities of unscrupulous developers and deforestation but while forest land is declining worldwide in fact weve lost 129 million hectares since 1990  the good news is the rate of decline is dropping sharply down 50 across the same period a lot of this is thanks to growing environmental awareness responsible forestry management and reforestation around the world 10000 hectares of new woodland was created in the uk in 2014 and in the usa where a third of all land is forested forestland has been consistently increasing over the last 25 years  theres been an increase of roughly 76 million hectares between 1990 and 2015 vigorously growing forests absorb co2 faster its well known that trees are the lungs of the earth but not all trees or ages are equally effective at absorbing the greenhouse gas co 2  a growing younger forest is a better sink for carbon dioxide than a forest that is mature and stable this has implications for the way these resources are used  notably when it comes to the sourcing of material for compressed wood pellets whereas coal releases carbon that has been trapped underground for millions of years wood releases carbon captured within its lifetime making it a very low carbon fuel once manufacturing and transportation are factored in the technique is to harvest trees when they have stopped growing at a fast rate use the wood for forest products such as timber pulpwood or compressed wood pellets for energy and replant the area with new high growth potential trees the result is a forest with a steady stream of co 2 hungry young trees and a steady stream of renewable raw material forests can stop floods a study led by the universities of birmingham and southampton and funded by the environment agency found that forests in europe play an important role in mitigating the effects of heavy rain thanks to the buffering abilities of the forest canopy and the enormous water absorption capacity of woods and forests they can slow the flow of a sudden downpour of rain overfilling nearby streams or rivers this water will eventually be released but slowing its movement mitigates flash flooding different parts of the forest have different uses the primary commercial product from forests is not a hard one to guess wood but theres more to it than that for construction timber the lower thicker parts of a trees trunk are used smaller parts of the trunk are used as pulpwood which can be used to make paper panels or for energy residues from the wood processing industry such as sawdust can also be used for compressed wood pellets with the rise of the internet smartphones and ereaders the paper market has been shrinking manufacture of highdensity wood pellets helps replace demand for wood once used by the paper market as pellets can be made using lowgrade wood thinnings and residues not used in construction or furniture trees talk to each other until recently it was thought that trees perform most of their biological functions in isolation from each other but biologists have learned in recent years that in fact they communicate and help each other under the forest floor trees roots are linked by bright white and yellow fungal threads called mycelium in a forest these threads act as a kind of network linking trees to one another these links enable trees to share nutrients carbon and water some species of tree also increase nitrogen uptake in the soil and help to improve the conditions in which other species grow in fact research by the university of british columbia  indicates that certain large older trees that rise above the forest act as mother trees which actively help to manage the resources for the other trees in the forest based on their findings it seems trees not only talk to each other but help each other grow too tags forests

against them and backup power is needed because it can be created by upgrading existing coalfired power stations it can be added to the electricity grid in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost of building new power stations why should the uk only build brandnew gas and nuclear power stations when existing coal power stations can be upgraded to low carbon renewable tech at drax we have shown how engineers working at what once was the biggest coal power station in western europe can use their expertise to work with compressed wood pellet power generation and it can save bill payers billions of pounds when the true costs of bringing other renewables on stream are taken into account the industrys greatest challenge right now is in proving that all the biomass we use is truly sustainable at drax we have proven the sustainability of the biomass we use time and time again but we can and will do more to ensure that standards right across the industry are always equally high we cannot underestimate the importance of sustainability no corners can be cut we must all join together and meet this challenge because without sustainable biomass there will be no industry at all without sustainable biomass in a balanced energy system with other renewables and low carbon technologies the paris climate change summit commitments may not be reached this is why the sustainable biomass program is so important the sbp has developed a certification framework to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources by working with the sbp all of us in the industry alongside hard working families and businesses stand to benefit which is why all of us at drax welcome its inception and look forward to working with the sbp to help build a growing and healthy industry that helps our society transition to the renewable fuels of the future may 2017 update the sbp has changed its name to the sustainable biomass program  you can read its first
