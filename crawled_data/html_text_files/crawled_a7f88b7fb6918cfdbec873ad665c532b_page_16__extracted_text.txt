young people 16 august 2021 press releases drax group is offering students a virtual insight into the world of work as part of the energy companys continued commitment to stem education supporting its efforts to increase social mobility for one million people the programme which is running online this week from 1620 august has been extended from four to five days and made available to a wider audience after the success of the first virtual work experience week in april the energy company has decided to run additional events to give even more students the opportunity to take part britains biggest power station near selby in north yorkshire has expanded its virtual work experience programme to offer even more young people insights into the workplace and boost employability and skills the energy company first launched virtual work experience as a result of not being able to run its usual onsite work experience programmes due to covid restrictions and has decided to continue the programme after receiving a positive response from those who took part engineering student tahmid md who took part in the previous virtual work experience programme said work experience at drax was a great week and i learnt a lot from the programme the cv building and interview sessions were especially helpful and i really enjoyed the engineering projects i took part in drax colleagues have put together a fiveday online programme which enables more students to participate from across england who may previously have found it difficult to take part due to barriers preventing their attendance such as geography opportunity and economic factors the work experience programme is part of draxs mobilising a million initiative which aims to increase social mobility by creating opportunities to further education and improve employability ensuring the country has the skilled workforce needed to support a postcovid green economic recovery drax groups head of sustainable business alan knight said we work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children from all backgrounds to study stem subjects so the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow virtual work experience builds on the work we did during lockdown to provide laptops free internet access and virtual tours of the power station to ensure no students were left behind in their studies department of education minister for apprenticeships and skills gillian keegan said its brilliant to see businesses like drax offering virtual opportunities for young people to learn about and prepare for the world of work as the energy market is changing there are new green jobs opening up for employees offering young people the chance to explore these new opportunities in the workplace is vital to shape their career goals and help them to discover the wide range of choices available for their future students who applied to take part in draxs virtual work experience programme aged 1418 could choose from four different business streams engineering business support it  project management and finance they will learn about the energy company focusing on developing employability skills and learning about their business area through conversations with employees and targeted projects they will also have the opportunity to ask members of draxs executive committee about their careers during a qa session this years covid lockdown resulted in many students being home schooled for months so the drax virtual work experience programme is

engineered greenhouse gas removals 29 july 2021 press releases the publication of the nics report further demonstrates the significant role engineered greenhouse gas removal technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage will play in enabling the uk reach its net zero target however urgent action is required within the next decade to support their roll out if the government is to meet its climate obligations deploying beccs at drax will not only save the uk billions of pounds over the next decade as the governments own analysis shows it will be vital if the uk is to meet the targets set out in the fifth and sixth carbon budgets it will also see the creation of a major new infrastructure sector in the uk which could rival the size of the uks water sector creating and protecting tens of thousands of jobs across the north levelling up the uk and positioning us as a global leader in negative emissions technologies editors notes the nic report is recommending that the government commits to deploying engineered removals at scale by 2030 and publish a plan to do so by no later than the end of 2022 by 2030 engineered removals should be delivering between 5mtco 2 and 10mtco 2 of negative emissions per year by 2030 the engineered removals sector could be receiving revenues of approx 2bn per year rising to 10s of bn by 2050 the first beccs unit at drax could be operational by 2027 with the second by 2030 the two units could capture up to 8mt of co 2 per year 80 of the amount the nic states will be needed by 2030

challenge press releases primary school pupils have built their own robots from recycled materials as part of an initiative developed by drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to boost stem education and skills the visitor centre team at drax power station has worked with colleagues at doncaster college and university centre to develop the stem box project an engaging activity for students to take part in relating to the subject areas of science technology engineering and maths a group of students aged between seven and ten at sunnyfields primary school in scawthorpe have been provided with individual activity boxes containing a range of learning materials games and resources they will need to build their robots the focus of which is on recycling and forms part of their school curriculum during the covid19 lockdown many pupils have struggled to engage with homeschooling and projects like the stem box provide a valuable opportunity to transition back into the school routine and get students enthusiastic about learning again the robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal or builtin compartments to store paper students also received a video recorded by the visitor centre guides to provide them with instructions once covid restrictions are relaxed they intend to deliver this introduction in person in schools as well as providing a visit to the power station as part of the project to help students understand the important role that recycling plays there drax groups head of sustainable business alan knight said by providing schools with these resources we hope to further students understanding of the importance of recycling and hopefully fire up their imaginations and inspire them to study stem subjects by showing them the wide range of career options that are available liane clark from childrens university at doncaster college said childrens university cu are excited to share this fantastic project with our cu schools to create an enriching learning experience that will inspire our future working generation our partnership with drax has enabled a unique learning opportunity which we hope will encourage children to deepen their knowledge and have a positive impact on their future children at sunnyfields primary school are the first to take part in the project which the drax power station visitor centre team plan to roll out to other schools across the region after the summer holidays teacher chloe hoogwerf said the students had a great time taking part in the stem box programme learning about drax and building the recycling robots activities like these are so important as it really brings the subject to life and gets students enthusiastic about stem as well as encouraging them to start thinking about careers they might enjoy in the future drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the next generation of engineers by encouraging interest in stem subjects earlier this year drax announced its
