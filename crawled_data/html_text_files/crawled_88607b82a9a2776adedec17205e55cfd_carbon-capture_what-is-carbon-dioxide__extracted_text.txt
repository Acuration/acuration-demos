dioxide or co 2  is a colourless and odourless naturally occurring gas in the earths atmosphere which is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms  as a greenhouse gas ghg it traps heat making sure the planet isnt uninhabitably cold however fast rising levels of co 2 and other longlasting ghgs in the atmosphere are currently causing global warming to occur at an alarmingly rapid rate what is the carbon cycle carbon is the basis of all life on earth  it is a key ingredient in almost everything on the planet as the earth has a closed atmosphere there has always been the same amount of carbon on the earth but it is in a constant state of change transitioning from gas to solid to liquid and moving between the atmosphere and the earth this process is called the carbon cycle  and it is key to ensuring the earth is capable of sustaining life co 2 forms one part of this process and makes up the largest available source of carbon on earth how is co 2 made carbon is stored in oceans soil and living things and is released from this storage into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together through a number of processes including the decay of organic matter the combustion of materials such as wood coal and natural gas through the breathing of humans and animals and from events such as volcanic eruptions how does co 2 affect the planet an abundance of co 2 in the earths atmosphere means more heat gets trapped which in turn contributes to a rise in global temperatures and climate change  this acceleration in carbon entering the atmosphere began during the industrial revolution around the 1800s when fossil fuels were mined and burned to create energy which released longstored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  from the beginning of the industrial revolution until today the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 387 parts per million which constitutes a 39 increase  today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together when organic materials containing carbon are burned wood coal and natural gas how can countries reduce co 2 in the atmosphere according to the paris climate agreement  nations must work to limit warming of the globe to be well under two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in the first half of 2015 the earth registered a one degree celsius rise in global temperatures above preindustrial levels which means drastic and meaningful action must be taken to decarbonise within the next few years there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including reforestation and using alternative ways to generate energy that dont rely on fossil fuels for example wind  solar  biomass and hydro can all provide sustainable carbonneutral and low carbon sources of electricity technology such as carbon capture and storage ccs can capture carbon permanently storing co 2 from industries in which some co 2 emissions remain by combining ccus with biomass energy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs it is even possible to generate negative emissions where more co 2 is removed from the atmosphere than is emitted  co 2 fast facts in the 1960s the growth of co 2 occurred at 06 parts per million per year in the last 10 years the rate has been 23 parts per million per year the average human breathes out 93 kilograms of co 2 per year  however our breathing only contributes 065 billion tonnes of carbon returned to the atmosphere which is 001 of the amount released by fossil fuels each year trees absorb co 2 in the atmosphere and release it in the form of oxygen making them vitally important in the worlds fight against climate change in the us alone forests absorb 13 of the nations carbon output there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including using alternative ways to generate power go deeper where drax and biomass fit into the carbon cycle renewable energy sources are only a part of the solution to cutting co 2 emissions draxs strategy to reducing co2 emissions
