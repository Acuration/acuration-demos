storage project has been accepted for examination by the planning inspectorate plans to replace draxs remaining coal generating units with up to 36 gigawatts gw of high efficiency gasfired power generation and up to 200 megawatts mw of battery storage were first set out in september 2017 since then the company has been developing engineering and environmental reports for the application as well as carrying out an extensive consultation programme with local people landowners councils and authorities the proposals will now be examined by an independent planning inspector before being considered by the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy beis with a decision expected in 2019 andy koss drax power ceo said i am delighted that the planning inspectorate has accepted our application for examination this is an important milestone for the repower project and takes us a step closer towards securing the future of the power station with our gas repower plans and the conversion of a fourth generating unit this summer to use biomass instead of coal we intend to extend the life of the plant protect jobs and deliver the flexible and reliable power millions of households and businesses need by upgrading and reusing some of our existing infrastructure to use gas we will be able to provide more capacity stability and essential grid services cost effectively
