power station how great britains breakthrough year for renewables could have powered the past 50 of the countrys electricity came from wind solar hydro nuclear and biomass in 2017 renewables alone produced enough to power 1958 21 february 2018 power generation after a year of smashing renewable records  great britains electricity system is less dependent on fossil fuels than ever before over the course of 2017 lowcarbon energy sources including nuclear as well as renewables accounted for half of all electricity production the finding comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the latest report highlights how great britains electricity system is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels with coal and gas dropping from 80 of the electricity mix in 2010 to 50 in 2017 its an impressive change for eight years but its even more dramatic when compared to 60 years ago powering the past with renewables in 2017 renewable output grew 27 over 2016 and produced 96 terawatt hours twh of electricity  enough to power the entire country in 1958 back then great britain was dependent on one fuel coal it was the source of 92 of the countrys power and its highcarbon intensity meant emissions from electricity generation sat at 93 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  compare that to just three million tonnes of co 2 emissions from roughly the same amount of power generated in 2017 just by renewables today the electricity system is much more diverse than in 1958 in fact with nuclear added to renewable generation 2017s total lowcarbon capacity produced enough power to fulfil the electricity needs of 1964s beatlemania britain but whats enabled this growth in renewable generation one answer as bob dylan explained a year earlier is blowin in the wind read the full article here powering the past  stormy weather powering great britain wind power experienced a watershed year in 2017 thanks to blusterier weather and a wave of new wind farm installations coming online wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 windfarms both onshore and offshore produced 15 of the entire countrys electricity output in 2017 up from 10 in 2016 the 45 twh it generated over the course of the year was almost double that of coal  and theres potential for this to increase in 2018 as more capacity comes online the 16 gigawatts gw of new offshore wind turbines installed in great britain last year accounted for 53 of the net 315 gw installed across europe  with large offshore farms at dudgeon and race bank still being commissioned the 32 gw of total new operating capacity registered in 2017 across offshore as well as onshore wind is on course to grow coauthor of the article renewableuks head of external affairs luke clark said these figures underline that renewables are central to our changing power system higher wind speeds and a jump in installed capacity drove a dramatic increase in the amount of clean power generated alongside breaking multiple records for peak output wind energy continued to cut costs as wind power is dependent on weather conditions it is intermittent in its generation but in 2017 more than one storm offered ideal conditions for wind turbines during q4 there were three named storms as well as the remnants of a hurricane all battering the british isles all of which helped push average wind speeds 5 higher than in 2016 while calculating wind power based on wind speed is complex  windier weather means more power  monthly average wind speed is proportional to monthly average power output from wind farms while the 2017 annual average wind speed of 101mph was in line with the countrys longterm average wind generation was not consistent across the year in q4 wind output was close to an average of 7 gw by contrast between may and august it was closer to 4 gw thankfully these calmer months saw longer hours of daylight allowing solar power to compensate read the full article here wind power grows 45 driving down carbon emissions the knockon effect of an increase in renewable generation is a drop in the carbon intensity of electricity production and in 2017 this reached a new low across the year carbon emissions including those from imported sources totalled 72 million tonnes down 12 from 2016 this decrease is equal to 150 kg of co 2 saved per person or taking 47 million cars off the roads the least carbon intensive period of the quarter came just after midnight in the early hours of monday 2 october when it measured a record low of 56 grammes per kilowatt hour gkwh thanks to low fossil fuel generation and high levels of renewables over the whole year there were 139 hours when carbon intensity dipped below 100 gkwh this generally required 50 of the electricity mix to come from renewable sources and demand to be lower than 30 gw for carbon intensity to dip under 100 gkwh on a more permanent basis greater renewable capacity will be required as demand rises read the full article here carbon emissions down 12 interconnectors meeting future demand electricity demand in great britain has been on the decline since 2002 primarily due to more efficient buildings and appliances  and a decline in heavy manufacturing however this is expected to change over the coming years as more electric vehicles are introduced and the heating system is electrified to help meet 2050 carbon emissions targets while installing greater renewable capacity will be crucial in meeting this demand with lowcarbon power interconnectors will also play a significant role particularly from france which boasts a large nuclear and lowcarbon capacity however electricity sales through interconnectors are often based on dayahead prices rather than the live market which can lead to trades that arent reflective of demand on each sides of the channel in q4 there were eight halfhours when demand was very high more than 50 gw yet power was being exported this occurred despite dayahead prices suggesting traders would lose money due to lower demand in france and the cost of using the interconnector it highlights the need for improvements in internetwork trading as great britain increases its intermittent renewable generation and looks to a greater reliance on importing and exporting power read the full article here moving electricity across the channel great britains electricity system continues to break its renewable records each year and heading into 2018 this is likely to continue wind and solar power will continue to grow as more installations come online and a fourth coal unit at drax will be upgraded to sustainable biomass  which could lead to another breakthrough year regardless
