power station europes first bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot now underway the commissioning of an innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot plant at drax power station has started with the first carbon dioxide expected to be captured in the coming weeks 26 november 2018 commissioning of the beccs pilot plant at drax power station will begin on monday november 26  the tenth anniversary of the climate change act it puts britain at the forefront of the race to develop beccs and could enable drax to become the worlds first carbon negative power station the commissioning of an innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot plant at drax power station has started with the first carbon dioxide expected to be captured in the coming weeks if successful the six month pilot project will capture a tonne of co 2 a day from the gases produced when renewable power is generated using biomass at drax  the uks biggest power station near selby in north yorkshire beccs is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced this means power generation would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere  vital for tackling climate change drax is partnering with leedsbased ccapture and is investing 400000 in what could be the first of several pilot projects undertaken at the power station to deliver a rapid lower cost demonstration of beccs drax power station became the largest decarbonisation project in europe by upgrading two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal and if the beccs pilot is successful it will examine options for a similar repurposing of existing infrastructure to deliver more carbon savings the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that beccs could enable us to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  approximately half the nations emissions target will gardiner ceo drax group said our beccs pilot project is the uks first step to delivering a key technology in the fight against climate change if this project is successful it could enable drax to become the worlds first carbon negative power station  something many would never have dreamed possible a decade ago starting to commission the pilot plant on the tenth anniversary of the climate change act demonstrates the progress made in decarbonising energy in the uk  but there is much more to do and this will be our focus at the edinburgh ccs summit later this week at drax we want to create a low carbon future  to do that we have to test the technologies that could allow us as well as the uk and the world to deliver negative emissions and start to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lr andy koss drax power ceo with prof chris rayner technical director ccapture ltd foreground eva penalver garcia drax group research and innovation engineer and rose mccarthy ccapture chemist middleground carl clayton drax research and innovation engineer and the beccs pilot project manager with caspar schoolderman director of engineering ccapture ltd background download high res photos here and here  the governments clean growth strategy identified beccs as one of several greenhouse gas removal technologies that could remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation energy  clean growth minister claire perry said this major milestone in developing cuttingedge technology to reduce emissions while growing the economy shows our modern industrial strategy in action backed by government funded innovation drax has helped put the uk on the map when it comes to carbon capture ahead of pivotal talks with global leaders in edinburgh this week which aim to supercharge the global deployment of this gamechanging technology over the summer work was undertaken to ensure the solvent ccapture has developed is compatible with the biomass flue gas at drax power station this was completed successfully along with a labscale study into the feasibility of reutilising the flue gas desulphurisation fgd absorbers at the power station fgd equipment is vital for reducing sulphur emissions from coal but it is no longer required to control sulphur on four of the generating units at drax that have been upgraded to use biomass because the wood pellets used produce minimal levels of sulphur the ccapture team has now proceeded to the second phase of the pilot with the installation of a demonstration unit once commissioned it will isolate the carbon dioxide produced by the biomass combustion chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds said its clear that beccs is one of a very limited number of viable negative emissions technologies and is vital if we are to reach our co 2 emissions targets not just in the uk but around the world being a key part of europes first beccs demonstration project is a great opportunity to showcase ccaptures technology and through working with drax show how we can make a real impact on climate change caspar schoolderman director of engineering at ccapture added this is a very important milestone on the pathway to demonstrating and scaling up our exciting new technology working closely with the team from drax has been a great experience and we look forward to getting the demonstrator fully operational and showing just how good our technology is ccapture is a spinout from the department of chemistry at the university of leeds established through funding from ip group plc ends media contacts ali lewis drax group interim head of media and pr e email

sustainable biomass for power in the world  around 70 of the electricity it produces is renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 drax is in discussions with the british beer and pub association to see if it could help keep the fizz in the drinks industry as part of its efforts to ensure the carbon captured during the beccs pilot project is used in another process or industry ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds university and has attracted support from ip group the department for business energy and industrial strategys energy entrepreneurs fund and the co 2 capture project for co 2 capture technology which has potential in a range of areas including biogas upgrading natural gas sweetening and hydrogen production about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies seven per cent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfueled electricity generator drax is the biggest renewable power generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcom about ccapture ccapture ltd utilise their extensive knowledge of co 2 carbon dioxide based chemistry and engineering to develop solvent systems for the removal of co 2 from gas streams with the potential to capture the co 2 in a form suitable for storage and prevent it from entering the earths atmosphere ccaptures proprietary technology aims to remove or scrub co 2 from large scale point sources of gas emissions this is important for a broad range of commercially and environmentally relevant areas the low cost high energy efficiency of ccaptures solvents help minimise the cost of ccs implementation and makes electricity generation with ccs a much
