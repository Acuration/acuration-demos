transport contact us tag drax power station transporting carbon  how to safely move co2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach its climate goals its just a matter of putting the pipes in place go deeper how do you store co 2 and what happens to it when you do tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  drax power station  negative emissions  sustainability  technology  zero carbon humber global collaboration is key to tackling the climate crisis will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2021 opinion leaders from 40 countries are meeting today albeit virtually as part of president joe bidens leaders summit on climate  the event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change set a clear pathway to net zero emissions while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition since taking office president biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the united states back into the paris agreement ahead of the twoday summit he announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target and new nationally determined contributions the us joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per year sending it for secure storage permanently locking it away deep under the north sea experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy it would also act as an anchor project for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to create the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the humber region and more than 200000 around the uk in 2039 additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this

is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a

such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in

national grid ofgem and the uk government the board of drax has determined to end commercial coal generation at drax power station in 2021  ahead of the uks 2025 deadline commercial coal generation is expected to end in march 2021 with formal closure of the coal units in september 2022 at the end of existing capacity market obligations will gardiner drax group ceo said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a worldleading carbon negative company by 2030 draxs move away from coal began some years ago and im proud to say were going to finish the job well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future coal in front of biomass storage domes at drax power station 2016 drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations under these proposals commercial generation from coal will end in march 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet capacity market obligations until september 2022 the closure of the two coal units is expected to involve oneoff closure costs in the region of 2535 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at drax power station of 2535 million per year once complete drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from april 2021 the carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was 240 million in addition to 103 million of inventory at 31 december 2019 which drax intends to use in the period up to 31 march 2021 the group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the groups financial statements a further update on these items will be provided in the groups interim financial statements for the first half of 2020 as part of the proposed
