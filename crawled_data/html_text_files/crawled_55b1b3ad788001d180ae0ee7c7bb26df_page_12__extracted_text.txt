generation its been another recordbreaking quarter for britains power system during the first three months of 2017 biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output and while this is all worth celebrating it shouldnt come as a surprise  the last few years have seen britains power system take several significant steps toward decarbonisation and this year is no different electric insights the quarterly report on britains power system by dr iain staffell from imperial college london commissioned by drax via imperial consultants documents the new gains and confirms the trend renewables are fast becoming the new norm and in 2017 they continued their growth the renewable record breakers over this quarter biomass electricity generation hit a record production figure of 44 twh which means that biomass generators ran at 95 of full capacity  higher than any other technology has achieved over the last decade hydro went 4 better than its previous energy production best by generating 16 twh while britains wind farms produced 113 twh 10 higher than the previous record set in 2015 this was helped in part by several new farms being built which increased installed capacity by 5 over last year but it was also indebted to the mild windy weather wind farms produced more electricity than coal 57 days out of 90 during the first three months of 2017 solar hit a new record peak output at the end of march when it generated 767 gw  enough to power a fifth of the country in fact during the last weekend of march for the first time ever the countrys demand for electricity from the national grid was lower during an afternoon than during the night this was because solar panels which only generate power when the sun is up tend to sit outside of the national high voltage transmission grid understanding how this happened is to understand how solar energy is changing our national power system a reverse of the trend electricity demand on the national grid  think of it as the power systems motorways  is typically higher during the day and early evening when people are most active using lights and gadgets than overnight however on the last weekend in march 2017 the opposite was true because of how much solar energy was generated solar panels and some smaller onshore windfarms are invisible  they dont feed into the national grid instead these sources either feed into the regional electricity distribution networks  the power systems a and b roads  or as many of them are on peoples roofs and used in their own homes or business premises it never gets down their driveway this can mean when solar panels are generating a lot of electricity there is a lower demand for power from the grid making it appear that less of the country is using electricity than it actually is this was the case during the last weekend of march when solar generated enough power to satisfy a large part of britains demand and while this is another positive step towards a lower carbon energy mix it is about to change the way our power system works particularly when it comes to the remaining coal power stations what the power system needs to provide today and in the future is flexibility  to ramp up and down to accommodate for the shifting demand based on supply of intermittent  weather dependent  renewables thermal power stations such as gas coal and biomass can meet much of this demand but even more rapid response from technologies such as the open cycle gas turbines that drax is developing and batteries could fulfil these needs quicker todays dirty is yesterdays clean the record breaking and increased renewable generation of the period from january to march 2017 would mean nothing if it wasnt matched by a decrease in emissions during the first three months of 2017 emissions dropped 10 lower than the same period in 2016 and a massive 33 lower than 2015 coal output alone fell 30 this quarter compared to q1 2016 to put the scale of this progress into context we need only look at the quarters dirtiest hour  the hour in which carbon intensity from electricity generation is at its highest between january and march it peaked on a calm and cold january evening with 424 grams of co 2 released per kwh gkwh the average for generation between 2009 and 2013 was 471 gkwh in short this quarters dirtiest hour was cleaner than the average figure just four years ago  yesterdays average is todays extremity if we want to continue to break records and further progress towards a fully decarbonised power system this needs to be a consistent aim making the averages of today tomorrows extremes top line stats highest energy production ever wind  113 twh biomass  44 twh hydro  16 twh record peak output solar

decarbonisation  electricity generation  energy policy  wind power more power per pound 23 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy as the country moves towards a lower carbon future each renewable power generation technology has its place wind solar hydro and wave can take advantage of the weather to provide plentiful power  when conditions are right reliable affordable renewable power but people need electricity instantly  not just when its a windy night or a sunny day so until a time when storage can provide enough affordable capacity to store and supply the grid with power from ample solar and wind farms the country has to rely in part on thermal generation like gas coal and biomass reliable and available on demand yes but renewable low carbon and affordable too it can be a year ago a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers at imperial college london highlighted how a balanced mix of renewable technologies could save bill payers more than 2bn  now publicly available ofgem data on which its newly published renewables obligation annual report 201516 is based reinforces the case for government to continue to support coaltobiomass unit conversions within that technology mix why because out of all renewables deployed at large scale biomass presents the most value for money  less public funding is required for more power produced renewable costs compared drax power stations biomass upgrades were the largest recipient of renewable obligation ro support during the period 201516 the transformation from coal to compressed wood pellets has made drax the largest generator of renewable electricity in the country and by a significant margin drax power station produced more than five times the renewable power than the next biggest project supported under the ro  the london array dr iain staffell lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy imperial college london and author of electric insights  who has analysed the ofgem data commented based on ofgems renewables obligation database the average support that drax power station received was 4305 per mwh generated this compares to 8870 per mwh from the other nine largest projects biomass receives half the support of the uks other large renewable projects which are all offshore wind the average support received across all renewable generators in the ro scheme  which includes much smaller projects and all types of technology  is 58 per mwh that is around 15 per mwh more than the support received by drax ending the age of coal drax group isnt arguing for limitless support for coaltobiomass conversions and drax power station being the biggest most modern and efficient of power stations built in the age of coal  is a special case but if the ro did exist just to support lots of biomass conversions like drax but no other renewable technologies then in just one year between 201516 1bn of costs saving could have been made for the public purse drax power station may be the biggestsingle site recipient of support under the ro  but it does supply more low carbon power into the national grid than any other company supported by renewable obligation certificates rocs in fact 65 of the electricity generated at its selby north yorkshire site is now renewable thats 16 of the entire countrys renewable power  enough to power four million households thanks to the support provided to drax by previous governments the current administration has a comparatively cost effective way to help the power sector move towards a lower carbon future biomass electricity generated at drax power station has a carbon footprint that is at least 80 less than coal power  supply chain included drax group stands ready to do more  which is why research and development

2017 the chancellor announced that the government remains committed to carbon pricing philip hammonds red book revealed that from 202122 the government will target a total carbon price and set the specific tax rate  giving businesses greater clarity on the total price they will pay further details on carbon prices are to be set out at autumn budget 2017 researchers at imperial college london have modelled what would have happened during 2016 with no carbon tax and also with an increased carbon tax they have compared both with what actually happened their conclusion no carbon tax would mean more coal less gas higher emissions a higher carbon tax would mean less coal more gas lower emissions since it was announced in 2011 the carbon price support cps has encouraged generators and industry to invest in lower carbon and renewable technologies it has also forced coal generators to fire their boilers only when they are really needed to meet demand such as during the winter months or at times of peak demand and still or overcast weather conditions during the summer months the introduction of the carbon price has meant that gas power stations which are less carbon intensive than coal have jumped ahead of coal in the economic merit order of energy generation technologies and produced a greater share of the uks power the same is the case for former coal generation units that have since upgraded to sustainable biomass  three such units at drax power station result in savings in greenhouse gas ghg emissions of at least 80 a coal cliff edge the carbon price support has resulted in significant savings in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions helping the uk meet its international climate change commitments removing or reducing the cps too soon and britains power mix risks going back in time it would improve the economics of coal and encourage britains remaining coal power stations to stay open for longer creating a risk to security of supply through a cliff edge of coal closures in the mid2020s changing the economics to favour coal also makes it harder to reach the uk governments goal of bringing a new fleet of gas power stations online what if  dr iain staffell from the centre for environmental policy at imperial college london has modelled a scenario in which the carbon price support did not exist in 2016 if the government had abolished all carbon pricing we would probably have seen a 20 increase in the power sectors carbon emissions said staffell removing the carbon price support would have the equivalent environmental impact of every single person in the uk deciding to drive a car once a year from lands end to john ogroats without the carbon price support emissions from electricity consumption would be 20 higher meaning an extra 250 kg per person equivalent to driving a car 800 miles running the numbers the carbon price support is capped at 18tco 2 until 2021 in his budget on 8 th march 2017 chancellor philip hammond  rightly in the view of drax  confirmed the governments commitment to carbon pricing using data from national grid and elexon and analysis from dr iain staffell electric insights shows how coal power generation was only needed last winter when electricity demand was greater than could be produced by other technologies alone coal was only used at times of peak demand because it was among the most expensive energy technologies in part due to the cps what if that wasnt the case and the government had decided to scrap the cps before that point in time more coal is burnt particularly during the daytimes  on average coal produces 2500 mw more over this week equivalent to four of drax power stations six generation units and what does dr iain staffells model suggest would have happened if the cap was doubled to 36tco 2  the change is stark even for a week in the winter with an average temperature across the country of 86 o c to see coal generation reduced so much compared to the actual cps of 18tco 2 or the 0tco 2 scenario model illustrates the impact of the carbon price support could bill payers save one argument for reducing the carbon price support  or scrapping it altogether  is the possibility that consumers and nondomestic electricity bill payers would save money its worth noting that apparent savings for electricity bill payers are lowered when the whole way that power is priced is accounted for by the time it reaches homes and businesses carbon price support does increase the cost of wholesale power says staffell but if you add the extra taxes other renewable and low carbon support measures transmission and balancing charges and fees imposed by electricity suppliers the overall impact on consumer bills is modest so if the government abolished all carbon pricing we could expect a 1 pkwh reduction in our tariffs but a 21 increase in our carbon emissions as a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers from imperial college london has already shown there are other ways to save bill payers money while encouraging a low carbon future their analysis published in early 2016 found that households and businesses could save 2bn if the government considered the whole system cost of electricity generation and supply when designing its competitions for support under its contracts for difference cfd scheme 2016 redux without the carbon price support the uk wouldnt have managed to send carbon emissions back to 19 th century levels  so if 2016 was played out one more time but with no carbon price support coal generation would have increased by 102 28 terawatthours to 56 twh gas generation would have decreased by 21 27 twh to 101 twh carbon emissions would have risen by 21 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to 92mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have increased by 20 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 349 gco 2 kwh and if 2016 had seen a doubling of the cps to 36tco 2  coal generation would have decreased by 47 129 twh to 147 twh gas generation would have increased by 9 118 twh to 1395 twh carbon emissions would have decreased by 10 73 mt co 2  to 686 mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have decreased by 9 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 263 gco 2 kwh the two scenarios presented above only modelled the impact of no or a higher carbon price support on nuclear coal and gas power supply in the realworld changes to the carbon price support would also impact on energy technologies that operate under the renewables obligation ro such as two of draxs three biomass units and much of the countrys other renewable capacity cps changes would also likely impact imports and storage while no analysis is perfect this clearly illustrates the significantly negative impact that scrapping or reducing the carbon price support would have on the uks decarbonisation agenda it also highlights the benefits that the governments decision to remain committed to carbon pricing will deliver what if  britain had no carbon price support

matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 23 february 2017 sustainable bioenergy there is an important difference between carbon dioxide co 2  emitted from coal and other fossil fuels and co 2 emitted from renewable sources both do emit co 2 when burnt but in climate change terms the impact of that co 2 is very different to understand this difference it helps to think small and scale up it helps to think of your own back garden one tree every year for 30 years imagine you are lucky enough to have a garden with space for 30 trees three decades ago you decided to plant one tree per year every year in this example each tree grows to maturity over thirty years so today you find yourself with a thriving copse with 30 trees at different stages of growth ranging from one year to 30 years old at 30 years of age the oldest has now reached maturity and you cut it down  in the spring of course before the sap rises  and leave the logs to dry over the summer you plant a new seedling in its place through the summer and autumn the 29 established trees and the new seedling you planted continue to grow absorbing carbon from the atmosphere to do so winter comes and when it turns cold and dark you burn the seasoned wood to keep warm burning it will indeed emit carbon to the atmosphere however by end of the winter the other 29 trees plus the sapling you planted will be at exactly the same stage of growth as the previous spring contain the same amount of wood and hence the same amount of carbon as long as you fell and replant one tree every year on a 30year cycle the atmosphere will see no extra co 2 and youll have used the energy captured by their growth to warm your home harvesting only what is grown is the essence of sustainable forest management if you didnt have your seasoned selfsupplied wood to burn you might have been forced to burn coal or use more gas to heat your home over the course of the same winter these fuels would have emitted carbon to the atmosphere which endlessly accumulates  causing climate change not only does your tree husbandry provide you with an endlessly renewable supply of fuel but you also might enjoy other benefits such as the shelter your trees provide and the diversity of wildlife they attract no added carbon this is a simplified example but the principles hold true whether your forest contains 30 trees or 300 million  the important point is that with these renewable carbon emissions provided you take out less wood than is growing and you at least replace the trees you take out you do not add new carbon to the atmosphere that is not true with fossil fuels it is true that you could have chosen not to have trees you could instead build a wind turbine or install solar panels on your land that would be a perfectly reasonable choice but youll still need to use the coal at night when the sun doesnt shine or when the wind isnt blowing worst of all you dont get all the other benefits of a thriving forest  its seasonal beauty and the habitat thats maintained for wildlife of course the wood drax needs doesnt grow in our garden we bring it many miles from areas where there are large sustainably managed forests and we carefully account for the carbon emissions in the harvesting processing and transporting the fuel to drax  thats why we only achieve more than 80 carbon savings

decarbonisation the next step andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 19 december 2016 opinion half a decade ago we began a major transformation at drax power station converting it to run on sustainable biomass this week weve reached another milestone in that journey weve been granted a contract for difference cfd  a uk government financial support thats now been approved by the european commission it allows us to fully convert a third power generation unit to run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of renewable biomass the granting of the cfd is a symbolic moment in our decarbonisation journey  it marks the close of one phase of development where the power station now makes more renewable than fossil fuel power and the start of the next this next chapter began when we announced two major projects the acquisition of opus energy and our plans to build four new rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt power stations  like the upgrade of drax power station these new peaking plants are an important step in helping the country achieve a decarbonised energy system they will do this by enabling more renewables to come onto the system the need for a diverse power network nearly 45 of the uks power already comes from gas mostly generated by combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants but while ccgt plants can deliver a steady supply of baseload power and flex up and down within seconds  just like drax power station does with both coal and biomass  they cant turn on and be at full capacity at very short notice starting from cold to quickly power the equivalent of a small city in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days however is exactly what the uk power network is increasingly going to need solar and wind power cant generate electricity when its dark or still so to facilitate more of these intermittent renewables coming onto the grid we need sources that can be quickly ramped up to fill the gaps when lower carbon technologies arent able to provide the essential power for the modern world this is where ocgt stations come in alongside other standby technologies such as storage and demand side response ocgt stations have turbines that work like jet engines this means they can start up incredibly quickly getting to full load in just 30 minutes meeting surges quickly when intermittent renewables cant and nuclear biomass and ccgt power stations are already providing baseload electricity our proposed plants could be online as soon as the winter of 202021  a few years before the last remaining coalfired power stations close down they will operate for roughly 500 hours a year with a maximum availability of 1500 hours depending on demand and each will have a capacity of 299 mw each will generate enough instant power to simultaneously boil 120000 kettles  as well as allowing more renewables onto the system these gas plants support the governments vision for reducing the carbon intensity of our energy grid  gas has half the carbon footprint of coal  more than that we have expertise in it drax ceo dorothy thompson  has developed and operated 3160 mw of gas assets in the past for intergen while a number of our engineers have worked across development construction and operation of gas projects we trade in it too so we know the market well in short a move into gas is one we are well suited too a secure economic future thanks to capacity market contracts our ocgt plants will have limited reliance on income from the energy markets in the future the capacity market is a government scheme designed to boost the uks energy security it does this by paying new and existing power plants a fixed price to be available to generate electricity in future winters the time of the year when demand is at its highest the price they are paid is determined by a competitive auction which allows government to secure as much capacity as it needs at the lowest price possible building new power stations requires substantial investment so having fixedprice contracts for power allows generators  like us  and their shareholders to invest in low carbon projects  safe in the knowledge that it will be economical to do so were aiming to secure 15year capacity contracts for one ocgt in england and one in wales within the next two years in the most recent capacity auction  the price was driven too low to justify a commitment to build the first two plants this doesnt mean development on the plants will stop critical development work will continue throughout 2017 and next december the plants will be reentered into the competition continued commitment to biomass our new power stations mark a new chapter for drax group but what they dont affect is our commitment to biomass drax power station is already generating a majority of its electricity using high density wood pellets  and the granting of the cfd means we can now finalise the coaltobiomass upgrade of half of the uks biggest power station and continue to invest in these assets with the right support we stand ready to complete the conversion of our north yorkshire site and run entirely on sustainablysourced biomass a study from engineering and design company arup found that after onshore wind converted biomass power plants are the most affordable largescale renewable power solution in the uk more than that the costs of undertaking this conversion have come down over the last few years however there is still room to bring this cost down further and we believe this needs to happen before we can fully convert drax power station we are as determined to achieve this as we have ever been our view has always been to ensure we provide power for a brighter future and our new power stations are the next step in doing this tags decarbonisation  energy policy  gas renewables better together andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 5 april 2016 opinion theres more pressure than ever to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation and no one is keener than the team here at drax power station to make it happen in fact weve been doing it for a decade but we need the right support to finish the job we upgraded our turbines between 200712 to save one million tonnes of co2 emissions weve converted half our station to run on compressed wood pellets instead of coal  reducing emissions by up to 86 per cent  our friends in the north of england have invested millions of pounds to help us make that happen through building new infrastructure at our landing and loading facilities at the port of tyne  the new port at liverpool  at hull and at immingham  weve designed and commissioned our own rolling stock with lloyds register rail to ensure that the compressed wood pellets can be transported to the power station in the most energyefficient way possible and while many jobs in the north of england are being lost with the planned closure of a number of older coalfired power stations we continue to employ over a thousand people directly here in north yorkshire in fact its no exaggeration to say that drax is a genuine northern powerhouse to borrow a phrase from the chancellor of the exchequer which is why we hope he and his colleagues in government will listen when we say that were seriously concerned that the planned auctions for new green energy could result in bill payers missing out on savings of over 2 billion the government has committed to three further renewable energy auctions that will happen over the next few years the first of them is already planned for later in 2016 as far as we know those auctions will only be open to offshore wind and perhaps also something being referred to as less established technologies but independent research published by nera and imperial college london suggests that a single technology approach could waste a significant amount of money the research was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main renewable energy technologies  wind solar and biomass as a result economists conclude that hard working families and businesses could enjoy significant savings if these auctions were opened up to include other renewables but the sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow this makes wind and solar intermittent energy technologies backup power is needed when the weathers not right or when demand is high naturally this standby energy isnt free someone has to pay for it but those additional costs are not currently included in the way that the government calculates how much support the different kinds of renewable energy require and the iclnera research shows that when the true costs are added in offshore wind is actually the most expensive form of renewable energy the affordable solution is to convert existing power stations to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal  this balanced approach also allows more offshore wind and solar onto our electricity network without the need for more fossil fuels to provide overall reliability more biomass conversions can also help the uk end coal by energy secretary amber rudds 2025 target date  thats what we mean when we say drax needs the right support to finish the job were asking the government to consider the true cost of bringing new renewable capacity on stream and then to add sustainable biomass to the auctions for new contracts that decision could save bill payers up to 2bn  it could safeguard thousands of direct and indirect jobs in yorkshire and the north of england and it will give our country the reliable renewable power
