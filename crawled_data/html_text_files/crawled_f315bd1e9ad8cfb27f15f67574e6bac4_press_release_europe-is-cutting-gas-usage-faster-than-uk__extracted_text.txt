europe is cutting gas usage faster than uk according to a new report the uk is trailing behind its european counterparts in cutting its gas usage in the wake of the energy security crisis 14 december 2022 european countries such as germany are leading the way in slashing their demand for gas according to drax electric insights the uk is showing no signs of changing its gas consumption levels with an exceptionally mild autumn leading to its modest reductions yearonyear households could save up to 200 by turning down their thermostat by just 1c and save the government 3bn in funding the energy price guarantee the independent analysis by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants shows that the uks gas reduction yearonyear was outpaced by germany france italy and spain  with demand for gas actually rising in britain in september compared to previous years change in natural gas consumption versus the previous three years in uk and comparable european countries data covers all sectors excluding power generation and are not adjusted for weather differences what reduction there was in gas use in the uk was attributable to unseasonably warm weather rather than people adjusting their behaviour the analysis for drax electric insights showed that from september through to end of november britains gas demand was just 03 lower than would have been expected preenergy crisis when accounting for weather anomalies daily natural gas consumption in uk versus expectations the blue line shows the seasonal average for all end users except power generation over 10 years to 2020 the yellow line adjusts for weather showing what demand would be with precrisis behaviour the black line shows actual consumption dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report said the uk is an outlier on the world stage showing no signs of reducing its appetite for gas during a time of dramatically higher prices if temperatures continue to drop during the festive season managing the energy crisis will be both more difficult and expensive unless people and businesses break their addiction to gas turning the thermostat down by just 1c would save households up to 200 a year on their energy bills and save the uk from importing 50twh of natural gas over the winter  cutting the cost of the governments energy price guarantee by 3bn on the continent national governments have introduced demand reduction measures alongside information campaigns to inspire the public and businesses to act in germany public buildings have turned down their thermostats to 19c and outside illuminated advertising must be turned off between 10pm until 6am the uk government has now launched a public information campaign on how people can claim financial support this winter alongside more technical advice on how to reduce energy use while still keeping warm such as reconfiguring boiler settings this followed the chancellor announcing a further 6bn to insulate homes and upgrade boilers  penny small draxs group generation director said as a result of russias war in ukraine the uks energy system is under considerable strain this winter and the combination of rising inflation and gas prices has put most household budgets under pressure britains longterm energy security will be strengthened by ending our reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels such as gas and instead increasing investment in homegrown renewables and innovative green technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and pumped storage hydro drax is the uks biggest renewable power producer by output generating enough renewable electricity from biomass and hydro for around 5 million homes it plans to invest billions of pounds expanding its pumped hydro storage capacity at its cruachan power station in scotland and also deploying beccs at its power station in north yorkshire to permanently remove 8million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030 ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 ali lewis head of media  pr e email protected t 07712 670 888 editors notes a copy of the drax electric insights q3 2022 report is available by clicking here  records broken during q3 2022 include power exports reaching an alltime instantaneous percentage high of total generation  209 warm weather was central to gas demand reduction in the uk with october 3c warmer the average with a recordbreaking 30c recorded on a singleday in gravesend in november during the first three weeks just one day in the month was colder than average britains gas demand is heavily linked to weather with an additional 160 gwh for every degree that it falls below 15c average household savings by reducing thermostats by 1c during the winter period october to march would save consumers 1150 per day as well as saving the country money reducing gas demand by 50 twh would cut carbon emissions by 102 million tonnes  or 3 of the uks total co 2 about electric insights electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of

capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 18 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate
