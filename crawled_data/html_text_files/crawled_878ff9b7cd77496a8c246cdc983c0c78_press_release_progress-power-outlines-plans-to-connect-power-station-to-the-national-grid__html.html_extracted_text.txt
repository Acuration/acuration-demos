Progress Power Outlines Plans to Connect Power Station to the National Grid
Progress Power, the developers of the proposed gas-fired power station at Eye Airfield, is today publishing new information about its project.
6 February 2014
The information relates to the electrical connection that will export electricity from the proposed power station on Eye Airfield to the existing overhead National Grid transmission lines that run parallel to the A140 Norwich road, and near to the villages of Yaxley, Mellis and Thrandeston.
Local parish councils, people living in these villages as well as other local interests, such as the Suffolk Preservation Society and Common Concern, are being notified of this new information.
After widespread consultation and extensive technical and environmental studies, Progress Power is proposing a new underground cable connection to a new sub-station (that is part of an Electrical Connection Compound) on land situated close to the National Grid transmission lines and located north of Yaxley and Mellis.  Progress Power has also today published proposals on how the Electrical Connection Compound will be accessed by construction vehicles to avoid traffic and disturbance in local villages.  A new junction off the A140 is being proposed.
Chris McKerrow, Project Director for Progress Power said: “Our proposals for the electrical connection avoid the need for more overhead pylons across the countryside, something that both Suffolk County Council and Mid Suffolk District Council, and members of the public, wanted us to avoid.  Our plans will include extensive landscaping, including the planting of trees, in order to minimise the visual impact of the Electrical Connection Compound.  We have also heeded people’s concerns about traffic to and from the site of the compound, expressed at our public exhibitions in October and since, by proposing a new junction off the A140.”
Detailed information about the Electrical Connection Compound and the proposed access arrangements can be accessed by the public via these different ways:
Website:
www.progresspower.co.uk
Local libraries: Diss, Eye, Ipswich, Ixworth and Stradbroke
Mid Suffolk District Council: at its Needham Market office
Local parish councils, local MPs, Common Concern and the Suffolk Preservation Society have received the Information Update from Progress Power, and so people can also obtain the Update from them as well as from the county and district councils.
Furthermore, notices about the new information have been posted in the local press and noticeboards in the area.  Progress Power will also host drop-in sessions in the area within the next 2-3 weeks to give people the opportunity to ask questions about the latest plans: the dates and locations will be published shortly.
Progress Power welcomes feedback and comment on this Information Update from local communities and organisations. This non-statutory update period runs until 6
th
March 2014.
Comments and feedback can be sent via
[email protected]
or by letter Freepost RTEY-JYYB-ERSR, Progress Power Ltd, 49 York Place, Edinburgh EH1 3JD.
