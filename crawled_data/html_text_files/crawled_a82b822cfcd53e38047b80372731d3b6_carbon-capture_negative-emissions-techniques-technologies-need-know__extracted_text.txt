some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere 28 november 2018 carbon capture cutting carbon emissions is the headline environmental policy for the 195 countries signed up to the paris climate agreement  and so it should be decarbonisation is crucial to keeping global warming below 2 o c and avoiding or at least mitigating potentially dire consequences for our planet its people and biodiversity however centuries of pumping out carbon dioxide co 2  from factories vehicles and power plants means its not enough just to reduce output countries must also work on co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere implemented at scale whats also known as greenhouse gas removal ggr could mean a country or facility removing more co 2 than it emits  effectively giving it negative emissions achieving this is not only advantageous to combating climate change its essential a new report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc explores 116 scenarios in which global warming is kept to 15 o c of preindustrial levels more ambitious than the paris agreements 2 o c of these scenarios 101 use negative emissions technologies nets at a scale of between 100 to 1000 gigatonnes  over the 21st century given the scale of the ambition the task of capturing enough carbon to be truly negative will need to rely on many sources here are some of the techniques technologies and innovations aiming to push the world towards negative emissions forests weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama cdr doesnt have to utilise complex tech and chemistry the planets natural carbon cycle already removes and stores huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere  primarily through trees the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global humangenerated co 2 emissions over the last few decades regenerating depleted forests reforestation planting new forests afforestation and protecting and helping existing forests thrive through active management can all contribute to offsetting emissions the ipcc report estimates that reforestations and afforestation could potentially capture 05 and 36 billion tonnes of co 2 a year at a cost of usd5 to 50 390 to 39 per metric tonne there are potential drawbacks of extensive afforestation it could compete with food crops as well as reducing the reflection of heat and light back into space that arid lands currently offer to prevent global warming bioenergy with carbon capture and storage europes first beccs pilot project at drax power station biomass on its own is an important fuel source in lowering emissions from industries such as power generation on one hand its created by organic material which during its lifetime absorbs carbon from the atmosphere often enough to offset emissions from transportation and combustion on another it creates a sustainable market for forestry products encouraging landowners to responsibly manage forests which in turn can lead to growing forests and increased co 2 absorption but when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs or ccus technology it becomes a negative carbon emissions process known as beccs drax is partnering with carbon capture company ccapture in a 400000 pilot to develop ccs technology which will remove a tonne of carbon from its operations a day combined with the carbon removed by the forests supplying the biomass it could turn drax into the worlds first negative emissions power station  beyond just storing the captured carbon underground however it can be used to create a range of products  locking in and making use of the carbon for much longer the ipcc report estimates between 05 and 5 billion metric tonnes of carbon could be captured globally this way at a cost of 100 to 200 80160 per metric tonne increased blue carbon mangrove roots its not only forests of fastgrowing pines or eucalyptus that remove co 2 from the atmosphere in fact coastal vegetation such as mangroves salt marshes and sea grasses suck in and store carbon in soil at a greater rate than plants on land  the carbon stored in these waterside ecosystems is known as blue carbon human encroachment and development on coastlines has depleted these environments however efforts are underway to regenerate and expand these hyperabsorbent ecosystems turning them into carbon sinks that can remove more emissions from the atmosphere than conventional forests apple is currently throwing its financial weight behind a mangrove expansion project in colombia to try and offset its global operations boosting ocean plants productivity beyond costal mangroves the ocean is full of plants that use co 2 to photosynthesise  in fact the oceans are thought to be one of the worlds largest carbon sinks but there are some people who think we could enhance marine plants absorption abilities eelgrass bed one such approach involves injecting iron nutrients into the ocean to prompt a bloom in microscopic plants called phytoplankton which float in the upper part of the ocean absorbing the co 2 absorbed from the atmosphere when the plants eventually die they then sink trapping the absorbed carbon on the seabed an additional positive effect would be an increase in dimethyl sulphide which marine plants emit this could alter the reflectivity of clouds that absorb water from the ocean and further act to cool the earth enhanced rock weathering plants absorbing co 2 through photosynthesis is the mostcommonly known part of the carbon cycle however rocks also absorb co 2 as they weather and erode the co 2 usually reaches the rock in the form of rain which absorbs co 2 from the atmosphere as it falls it then reacts with the rocks very slowly breaking them down and forming a bicarbonate that is eventually washed into the ocean locking the carbon on the seabed the problem is it takes a long time one idea that seeks to use this natural process more effectively is to speed it up by pulverising rocks and spreading the resulting powder over a larger area to absorb more co 2 from rain and air natural rock weathering currently absorbs around 03 of global fossil fuel emissions annually but the ipcc estimates at scale it could capture 2 and 4 billion metric tons at a cost of between 50 and 200 39160 per metric ton this approach also requires extensive land use and has not been trialled at scale sequestering carbon in soil soil is another major carbon sink plants and grasses that die and rot store carbon in the soil for long periods however modern farming techniques such as intensive ploughing and fertilisation causes carbon to be released and oxidised to form co 2  adjustments in farming methods could change this and at scale make agriculture carbon neutral  straightforward techniques such as minimising soil disturbance crop rotation and grassland regeneration could sequester as much as 5 billion tonnes of carbon into the soil annually according to the ipcc at potential zero cost a challenge to this method is that once soil is saturated it cant hold any more carbon that material would also be easily released if methods are not maintained in the future increasing soil carbon with biochar a way to supercharge how much carbon soil can store is to add a substance called biochar to the earth a type of charcoal made by burning biomass  such as wood or farm waste in the absence of oxygen biochar can increase the amount of carbon locked into the soil for hundreds or thousands of years it also helps soil retain water and reduce methane and nitrogen emissions biochar has only been trialled at a small scale but the ipcc estimates that between 05 and 2 billion metric tonnes could be captured annually through this means however it predicts a cost of between 30 and 120 2394 per metric tonne additionally producing biochar at scale would require large amounts of biomass that must be sustainably sourced direct air capture co 2 is in the air all around us and so removing it from the atmosphere can effectively take place anywhere direct air capture dac or daccs proposes that the carbon capture and storage technology many power stations are now trialling can be carried out almost anywhere direct air capture of co2 by a climaworks startup kezo involving garbage incineration in switzerland swiss startup climeworks is one company attempting to make dac viable  its technology works by passing air through a surface that reacts with co 2 to form a compound but releases the remaining air the newly formed compound is then heated so the reactive chemical agent can be separated and reused the co 2 is then stored underground with gas and water where it reacts with basalt and turns to stone in less than two years the main challenge for this technique is the cost  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne  and that it requires large amounts of energy creating further demand for electricity one hundred million tonnes wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the primary challenge for negative emission technology as a whole is that so few have actually been implemented at a global scale however trials are in motion around in the world including at drax to remove emissions and help limit the effects of climate change even if the uk decarbonises heavily across all sectors of the economy by 2050 theres still projected to be 130 mtco 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide net emissions but a royal academyroyal society report released earlier this year was optimistic it concluded that the country can become net zero and do its part in mitigating man made climate change  with beccs identified as
