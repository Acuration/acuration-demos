executive officer drax group 1 october 2018 opinion the uk has come a long way in its efforts to decarbonise greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43 below 1990 levels  while increasing renewable electricity generation and a strengthening carbon price means the country could soon go coalfree for an entire summer  there is still however much work needed to reach the uk target of reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the paris agreements aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius as ambitious as these goals may be recent research by the energy transitions commission etc believes they can be met by 2050 with the right government policies and action from businesses to help to mitigate man made climate change all industries across all sectors must cut carbon emissions its a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation this step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation transforming what was once western europes largest coalfired power station into the uks biggest decarbonisation project this puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed  across the electricity industry and other sectors  to reach a zerocarbon world electricity generation will lead decarbonisation the electrification of carbonintensive sectors such as transport and heating will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zerocarbon sources the etcs research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85 of the worlds electricity generation by 2050 when these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15 will come from a combination of nuclear hydro biomass and storage including batteries pumped storage and new technologies in fact biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15 but it is critical that this flexible renewable low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced for the wood biomass we use at drax power station its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests which will be another key part of the climate change solution will gardiner ceo drax group at drax we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of our own biomass pellet supply chain  from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading the skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chainbased industries along the path to lowercarbon emissions more than this it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this from here to zerocarbon one of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage were leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a sixmonth pilot of a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs system which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four 600 megawatt mw biomass units capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds but also opens new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon  for drax beccs takes us another step towards becoming a carbon negative operation  where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit it is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which will be essential in meeting climate change goals  alongside this our plans to repower the last of our coalfired units to highlyefficient combined cycle gas turbines ccgt and build four rapidresponse open cycle gas turbines ocgt will give the electricity system the flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources  the abilities of gas plant in balancing and system services can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025 in subsequent decades gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zerocarbon power system our retail businesses haven power and opus energy  also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint beyond just supplying renewable electricity were also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs reaching a zerocarbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers that depends on innovative thinking and new technologies we have the experience in developing transformative ideas and making them a reality  all of which will be essential in guiding us into a brighter more stable decarbonised future tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  negative emissions  will gardiner what can be made from captured carbon 11 september 2018 carbon capture the combination of a heatwave and an entertaining world cup campaign put big demands on great britains beer supplies this summer but europeanwide carbon dioxide co 2  shortages put a hold on that celebratory atmosphere as word spread that a lack of bubbles could result in the country running out of beer the drinks business managed to hold out but the threat of long term co 2 shortages still lingers over the continent one possible  and surprising  solution could lie in electricity generation thanks to the capturing and storing of its carbon emissions carbon capture and storage ccs is one of the key technologies in need of development to allow nations to meet their paris agreement goals it has the potential to stop massive amounts of emissions entering the atmosphere but it also raises the question what happens to all that carbon once its captured drax recently met with the british beer  pub association to discuss using some of the carbon it plans to capture in its upcoming trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs to keep the fizz in drinks its a novel solution to a potential problem but its just one of the many emerging possibilities being developed around the world smarter sneakers carbon capture is all about reducing carbon footprints  a phrase energy company nrg interpreted quite literally by creating the shoe without a footprint  the white trainer was created to showcase the abilities of carbon capture use and storage ccus and is made of 75 material produced from captured emissions that have been turned into polymers a molecular structure similar to plastics only five pairs of the sneakers were created as part of nrgs carbon xprize competition to find uses for captured carbon however they remain symbolic of the versatility offered by captured and stored carbon and its potential to contribute to the manufacture of everyday objects better furniture finding an alternative to plastics is one of the key ways of facilitating a move away from global dependencies on crude oil sustainable materials company newlight uses captured co 2 or methane emissions to create a bioplastic called aircarbon  a thermopolymer which means it can be melted down and reshaped the company has teamed up with ikea  which will buy 50 of the 23000 tonnes of bioplastic newlights plant produces per year its part of the swedish furniture giants efforts to increase the amount of recycled materials it uses and means upcycled carbon could soon be appearing in millions of homes around the world cleaner concrete if the shoes people walk around on can be made from captured carbon so too can the cities they walk within making concrete is a notoriously dirty process cement the main binding agent in concrete is thought to contribute to as much as 5 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions  but this could change thanks to clever use and implementation of carbon capture technology at one level ccs can be introduced to capture emissions from the manufacturing process on another the co 2 captured can be used as a raw material from which to create the concrete effectively locking in carbon and storing it for the long term teams of engineers material scientists and economists at ucla who have worked on the problem for 30 years have succeeded in creating construction materials from co 2 emissions in lab conditions using 3d printing technology now its just a matter of scaling it up to industrial usage a metal alternative carbon nanotubes are stronger than steel but lighter than aluminium which makes them a hugely useful material theyre currently used in jets sports cars and even in industrial structures but producing them can be expensive and until recently could not utilise co 2 for manufacture a team from george washington university is changing that its c2cnt technology splits captured co 2 into oxygen and carbon in a molten carbonate bath using electrolysis from here the carbon is repurposed into carbon nanotubes at a high rate and lower cost than previous methods future fuels transportation is one of the major emitters of carbon around the world so any way it can be reduced or reused in this field will be a huge positive carbon recycling company lanzatech has developed a way to do this via a process that uses anaerobic bacteria to ferment emissions into cleaner chemicals and fuels its first facility opening this year in china will create fuelgrade bioethanol that can be blended with gasoline to create vehicle fuel or even converted into jet fuel with 65 lower greenhouse gas emissions  aviation too can benefit from carbon recycling through the creation of synthetic crude oil and gas using co 2  technology company sunfire is developing processes that combine hydrogen set to become a major part of industry and transport and biogenic co 2  emissions from natural sources to create synthetic hydrocarbons that could fuel planes from silicon valley to valles marineris earth isnt the only place humans are innovating around carbon capture  at least right now with the race to send men and women to mars stepping up the challenges of dealing with its inhospitable atmosphere which is 95 co 2  and ensuring a minimal human impact to the planet are becoming more acute carbon capture and use presents an opportunity to tackle both californian company opus 12 has developed a device that recycles co 2 from ambient air and industrial emissions and turns it into fuels and chemicals using only electricity and water the device has the co 2 conversion power of 37000 trees or 64 football fields of dense forest packed into the volume of a suitcase and can convert co 2 into 16 different products in the longterm the technology might provide critical services for human colonies on the red planet by capturing and using co 2 from the atmosphere or any future marsbased factories the opus 12 device can also use ice buried on the planet in places that could be accessible to astronauts  to convert mars co 2 into plastic to make bricks and tools methane that can form rocket fuel and feedstocks for microbes to create medicine or food turning pollution into possibilities many of these technologies are in their infancy but the possibilities they present are very real in fact draxs upcoming trial of beccs will see it capture and store as much as a tonne of carbon every day the proliferation of this technology in industry and electricity production  and the resultant increase in captured carbon  will help encourage more companies to see co 2 emissions as an opportunity for revenue while helping countries meet their paris agreement emissions goals

unveiling our ambition to play a major role in fighting the climate crisis by becoming the worlds first carbon negative company tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  negative emissions  technology a positive negative 18 january 2017 carbon capture this story was updated in june 2018 following the announcement of draxs pilot beccs project is there a way to generate electricity not only with no emissions but with negative emissions its an idea that after decades of being reliant on coal had seemed almost impossible but as drax has shown by announcing a pilot of the first bioenergy carbon capture storage beccs project of its kind in europe  it might not be impossible for much longer a few years on from the historic paris agreement  which sets a target of keeping global temperature rise below two degrees celsius  innovative solutions for reducing emissions are critical among these few are more promising than beccs it sounds like a straightforward solution  capture carbon emissions and lock them up hundreds of metres underground or turn the carbon into useful products  but the result could be gamechanging generating electricity with negative emissions capturing carbon carbon capture and storage ccs technology works by trapping the carbon dioxide co 2  emitted after a fuel source has been used and moving it to safe storage  often in depleted oil and gas reservoirs underground there are a number of ccs technologies available but one of the simplest is oxyfuel combustion fuel such as coal gas or biomass is burnt in a high oxygen environment and co 2  rather than carbon c or carbon monoxide co  is produced other impurities are removed and the resulting pure co 2 is compressed to form a liquid this co 2 can then be transported via pipeline to its designated storage space normally hundreds of metres underground the uk is wellplaced to benefit from the technology thanks to the north sea  which has enough space to store the eus carbon emissions for the next 100 years its a technology that can drastically reduce the emissions from fossil fuel use but how can it be used to produce negative emissions two technologies working as one biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured as part of its life in the forest is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report published by the energy technology institute eti looking at the uk has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year  approximately half the nations emissions target its not the only body heralding it as a necessary step for the future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated in a 2014 report that keeping global warming below two degrees celsius would be difficult if beccs had limited deployment support is widespread but for it to lead to a practical future beccs needs suitable support and investment mills such as morehouse bioenergy manufacture compressed wood pellets  a sustainablysourced fuel for beccs power plants of the future positive support for negative emissions there are only a handful of ccs projects in operation or under construction across the world and many simply reuse rather than capture the co 2  part of the reason is cost its estimated that optimal ccs technology can cost about as much as the power station itself to install and running it can consume up to 20 of a stations power output this means more fuel is needed to produce the same amount of power compared to a conventional power plant of similar efficiency without government support it remains a prohibitively expensive solution for many power generators with government support in the form of multidecade contracts large ccs or beccs plants could leverage economies of scale they could deliver energy companies and their shareholders a return on the investments in the longterm drax research and development past plans by drax could have put the company on a timeline towards becoming the worlds first large scale negative emitter of co 2  it would have achieved it firstly with the construction of a ccs power station at its selby north yorkshire site the 428 mw white rose power station was to be fuelled by a mixture of coal and biomass and once in operation could have paved the way for similar facilities elsewhere as carbon capture technology improved and costs came down but unfortunately the project never went ahead  there are some positive signs that carbon capture technologies are developing around the world the first clean coal power station became operational in the us earlier this month  and a second ccs plant is on the way a ukbacked carbon capture and use ccu project in india recently opened at a chemicals factory involving the capture of emissions for use in the manufacturing process  back in the uk where the government outlined plans to end coalfired power generation by 2025  carbon capture power stations must become financially competitive if they are to become a major part of the countrys low carbon future but if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must and beccs remains a leading technology to help achieve it tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass energy  energy policy  negative emissions  power station  1
