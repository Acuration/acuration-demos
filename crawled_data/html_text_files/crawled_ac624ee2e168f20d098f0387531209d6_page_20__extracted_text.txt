investors what is a working forest 1 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy for centuries civilizations have relied on forests and forest products forests provided fuel food and construction materials and there were plenty of them but when in 18 th century europe the needs of growing industrialisation sent development into overdrive a problem arose forests were struggling to meet demand in germany the problem was acute the growing steel industry had increased demand for wood to power its smelters and for wood used in mining operations large areas of forestland were stripped to meet industrys needs and overall supply was quickly decreasing no one was more acutely aware of the challenge than hans carl von carlowitz who at the time was the head of the saxon mining administration so in 1713 he published silvicultura oeconomica a book which advocated the conservation and management of german forests so they could provide for industries in the long term although he drew on existing knowledge from around europe it was the first time an important term was used nachhaltigkeit the german word for sustainability  carlowitz explained this new term conservation and growing of wood is to be undertaken in order to have a continuing stable and sustained use as this is an indispensable cause without which the country in its essence cannot remain it was arguably the start of the scientific approach to forestry and although our needs of forests have changed as have the words we use to describe them  working forest plantation forest and managed forest all refer to largely the same thing that same principle is at the heart of how a modern working forest functions to ensure what exists and is useful today will still be there tomorrow this approach relies on responsible forest management which sets out a few key principles on how a forest should be managed to sustain its life providing room to breathe working forests are commonly managed to produced sawlogs  high value wood that can be sawn to make timber for construction or furniture for a forester to optimise the quality and quantity of sawlogs regular thinning is required thinning is the process of periodically felling a proportion of the forest to aid its overall health and vigour this means there are fewer trees fighting for the same resources water sunshine soil more than that thinning can promote diversity by providing more light and space for other flora thinning can occur several times in a forests cycle it can be used to increase the size and quality of the remaining trees and also to encourage new seedlings to establish in place of the harvested trees when managing for continuous forest cover httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201705whatisaworkingforestfinalmp4 nothing should be wasted the roundwood produced by thinning is often too small to be sold as sawlogs but that doesnt mean its worthless it can be sold to the pulp industry to make paper or for particleboard or to the biomass industry to make compressed wood pellets  which can be used to fuel power generation  as is done at drax power station  these industries also provide a market for the lower grade roundwood removed when the more mature trees are finally harvested in areas where there was no robust market for this low grade wood it would often be left on site and become a fire risk or a haven for pest and disease attack too much low grade material left on site can also inhibit the regrowth of the next tree crop so markets for this material are important for the health of the forest and the value of the land to the forest owner also in the baltic countries markets for pulpwood are limited and the energy sector provides a valuable opportunity to clear the site for replanting and provide additional revenue to the forest owner this process of utilising all parts of the forest is essential for a healthy working forest on the one hand the revenue can cover the cost of thinning this husbandry enhances the quality of the final tree crop and ensures that money is available to invest in future planting and regeneration ensuring the forest area is consistently maintained and improved young regeneration in a shelterwood system demonstrating the continuous forest lifecycle the carbon benefits of a working forest rather than diminishing it actively managing a forest helps its ability to sequester  or absorb and store  more carbon  carbon sequestration is directly related to the growth rate of a tree  a young growing tree absorbs more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than an older one  older trees will have more carbon stored after a childhood spent absorbing it but if these are not harvested they are more susceptible to fire damage pests and diseases and their carbon absorption plateaus in an actively managed forest older trees ready for sawlog production can be harvested and replaced with vigorously growing young trees and in the process maximise the co 2 absorption potential of the forest the byproducts of this process  the low grade wood and thinnings  can be used for the pulp and biomass industry which both aids the health of the remaining forest and provides revenue for the forester to invest in the long term life of his or her forest  three centuries of sustainability in the 300 years since carlowitz published his book on sustainability a lot has changed and while its unlikely he foresaw forests providing fuel for renewable electricity and renewable heat  the approach remains as relevant what is a working forest it is one that is as productive and healthy tomorrow as it is today that were using the same resource today as we were 300 years ago is evidence to suggest its a practice that works tags investors  forests  sustainability batteries as big as biomass domes 24 may 2017 sustainable bioenergy renewables are playing a bigger part of our electricity mix as the uk moves towards a low carbon economy how we plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables is among the greatest challenges faced by the energy sector sources like wind and solar are intermittent  they cant generate electricity all the time when the sun doesnt shine or the wind doesnt blow they lack the fuel needed to generate power and cant feed into the grid this leaves a gap in the uks electricity supply that needs to be filled today thats done by sources like coal gas and biomass which can be dialled up and down to accommodate for the dips and peaks in generation created by changes in demand and the weather one alternative being touted as a possible solution is storage and in particular battery technology however creating batteries on a scale big enough to meet our incredible demand is a considerable challenge its a challenge that will be met in a future where giant affordable batteries are able to store solar power captured in the summer months for use in the winter but costs would have to come down at an even faster rate than they have done in recent years the challenge of building bigger batteries to demonstrate the size of this challenge consider the biomass storage domes at drax power station these effectively operate as giant energy stores with the flexible ability to quickly feed renewable fuel to the power station which generates electricity on demand our biomass domes can hold 300000 tonnes of sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets  the equivalent of 600 gwh worth of electricity currently batteries cost 350 per kwh meaning at present prices it would cost 210 billion to replace the capacity of all four of our biomass domes using battery power even if battery technology advances dramatically over the next few years that figure is only likely to fall to around 60 billion then there is the question of the ancillary services that thermal power stations provide the batteries of the future may be able to provide these vital services such as synthetic inertia shortterm reserve and reactive power but for now providing these via battery power is prohibitively expensive and in some cases best left to biomass and gas power stations we should not underestimate the challenges ahead the uks everchanging power system will need to balance more electricity generated via wind and solar with affordable solutions that are also reliable flexible and lower carbon than coal  this is why drax is developing four rapidresponse gas power stations in addition to continuing its investment in biomass generation and supply tags energy storage  investors  drax power station everything you ever wanted to know about cooling towers 17 may 2017 power generation cooling towers arent beautiful buildings in the traditional sense but its undeniable they are icons of 20 th century architecture theyre a ubiquitous part of our landscape  each one a reminder of our industrial heritage yet despite the familiarity we have with them knowledge about what a cooling tower actually does remains limited a common misconception is that they release pollution in fact what they actually release is water vapour  similar to but nowhere near as hot as the steam coming out of your kettle every morning and this probably isnt the only thing you never knew about cooling towers what does a cooling tower do as the name suggests a cooling towers primary function is to lower temperatures  specifically of water or cooling water as its known at drax power stations utilise a substantial amount of water in the generation of electricity at a thermal power plant such as drax fuel is used to heat demineralised water to turn it to high pressure steam this steam is used to spin turbines and generate electricity before being cooled by the cooling water which flows through two condensers on either side of each of the steam turbines and then returning to the boiler it is this process that the cooling towers support  and it plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of electricity generation at draxs north yorkshire site to optimise water utilisation some power stations cycle it to do this they have cooling towers of which at drax there are 12 these large towers recover the warmed water which then continues to be circulated where chemistry is permitting the warmed water about 40c is pumped into the tower and sprayed out of a set of sprinklers onto a large volume of plastic packing where it is cooled by the air naturally drawn through the tower the plastic packing provides a large surface area to help cool the water which then falls in to the large flat area at the bottom of the massive structure called the cooling tower pond as the water cools down some of it  approximately 2  escapes the top of the tower as water vapour this water vapour which is commonly mistakenly referred to as steam may be the most visible part of the process but its only a byproduct of the cooling process the majority of the water utilised by drax power station is returned back to the environment either as vapour from the top of the towers or safely discharged back to the river ouse each year about half of the water removed from the river is returned there in effect it is a huge amount of water recycling and in environmental terms  it is not a consumptive process how do you build a cooling tower the history of cooling towers as we know them today dates back to the beginning of the 20 th century when two dutch engineers were the first to build a tower using a hyperboloid shape very wide on the bottom curved in the centre and flared at the top the structure meant fewer materials were required to construct each tower it was naturally more robust and it helped draw in air and aid its flow upwards it quickly became the de facto design for towers across the world the dutch engineers tower measured 34 metres which at the time was a substantial achievement but as engineering and construction abilities progressed so too did the size of cooling towers today each of 12 towers measures 115 metres tall  big enough to fit the dome of st pauls cathedral or the whole of the statue of liberty with room to spare if scaled down to the size of an egg the concrete of each cooling tower would be the same thinness as egg shell the structures at drax are dwarfed by the cooling towers at the kalisindh power plant in rajasthan india the tallest in the world each stands an impressive 202 metres tall  twice the height of the tower housing big ben and just a touch taller than the uks joint fifth tallest skyscraper the hsbc tower at 8 canada square in londons canary wharf the industrial icon of the future todays energy mix is not what is used to be the increased use of renewables means were no longer as reliant on fossil fuels and this has an effect on cooling towers already a large proportion of the uks most prominent towers have been demolished going the same way as the coal they were once in service to but this doesnt mean cooling towers will disappear completely power stations such as drax which has upgraded four of its boilers to superheat water with sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets instead of coal the dwindling coal fleet and some gas facilities still rely on cooling towers as they continue to be part of our energy mix the cooling tower will remain an icon of electricity generation for the time being but itll be a mantle it shares with biomass

the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made tags investors

had time to review them by way of a reminder our principal performance indicators and operational achievements for 2016 are summarised on the screen 2016 was a pivotal year for drax marking the completion of the biomass transformation project which commenced in 2012 and the announcement of a new strategy to deliver longterm sustainable value for our shareholders our underlying earnings for 2016 at 140 million was in line with our guidance although 29 million below 2015 this reflects the continuation of challenging commodity markets and the removal of climate change levy ccl exemptions however we were pleased to be able to partly offset the impact of these factors with a focus on flexible system support the prompt and balancing markets ancillary services and improving retail margins all of which are important parts of our strategy to develop broader noncommodity exposed earnings against a background of low wholesale electricity prices the group has again delivered strong operational performance this is not something we take for granted and it remains at the core of our strategy following a comprehensive review initiated in 2015 the groups new strategy has been defined and is based on creating a more diversified earnings base that will produce higherquality returns in the long term central to this strategy drax aims to play an increasing role in the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future we announced our new strategy to the market in december evidence of delivering on the new strategy can already be seen in the acquisition of opus energy and four projects to develop rapidresponse open cycle gas turbine ocgt generation plants and most recently we have made progress in our plans to expand our biomass pellet selfsupply capability with the provisional acquisition of a new biomass pellet plant in louisiana sustainably sourced biomass generation remains at the heart of your business and we were delighted to be able to complete the full conversion of our third biomass generating unit resulting in drax delivering 16 per cent of the uks renewable electricity biomass is the most costeffective large scale renewable and with the right policy frameworks we could become 100 renewable through the full conversion of our three remaining coal units and we could do this well before 2025 supporting the governments objective to remove unabated coal from the system through our strategy your board remain focused on optimising the value of the group as well as remaining alert to opportunities for growth the sustainable biomass we use to provide energy is at the heart of our business because this must be sustainable we always strive to ensure all our pellets comply with our policy we are well aware of the obligations we have to society and specifically the communities in which we are located as well as the wider environment we take these obligations very seriously and id like to remind you our shareholders of our guiding principles we never work in countries that lack proper regulation we never cause deforestation or forest decline we never source from areas that are officially protected or where our activities would harm endangered species we only take wood from working forests that grow back and stay as forests we require all our suppliers to pass tough screening and sustainability audits conducted by independent auditors we only source wood from countries that already have huge working forests where we provide another market for low grade material that solidwood industries such as construction and furniture manufacture arent using this year there are a larger number of resolutions than usual as a result of the submission of a new remuneration policy for consideration by shareholders and a

more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station and smaller power plants but this isnt the only way bioenergy is being used around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways powering selfsufficient robots what type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs

company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags investors  technology  sustainability  biomass energy how much does it cost to charge my iphone 4 april 2017 electrification its difficult to imagine life without electricity its ubiquity means its easy to forget the incredible feats of science engineering and infrastructure that allow us to undertake a task as simple as plugging in our smartphones in fact so expansive are the nationwide infrastructure networks that lie beyond the wall socket keeping a topoftherange mobile phone charged for a year can cost as much as 67p to work out how much electricity an appliance uses theres a relatively straightforward equation we can follow of power kilowatt kw x time hours used  energy transferred kilowatthour kwh to then work out how much that costs in real terms we need to take the wattage of the appliance worked out in kilowatts as this is the metric electricity tariffs are measured in multiply that by the number of hours it is being used for then multiply that figure kwh by your energy tariff  in the case of an iphone it works out like this a typical iphone charger is 5w 0005 kw  and a full charge from empty takes a maximum of three hours a conservative estimate the average electricity tariff in the uk is 15p per kwh which leads to an equation that looks like this 0005 x 3 x 015  000225 a day and if we assume that an iphone owner might fully charge their phone roughly 300 times a year the total annual sum amounts to a princely 675p theres no other way of looking at this  its a very low number but its important to think about this number in scale extrapolate it across the number of devices in the country and it grows significantly a 2016 study on uk smartphone owners suggests three quarters of all adults have smartphones which would put the country total somewhere in the region of 40 million per day thats 600 mwh of electricity needed to power their smartphones thats the equivalent of 200 mw of power generation or enough to power 565000 households for one hour how much electricity do my other appliances use unfortunately not all appliances are as modern efficient and cost effective as your average smartphone in fact when it comes to household appliances charging your apple iphone samsung sony or windows phone device is one of the least powerhungry activities you can undertake a bigger offender is your fridgefreezer but not because they need a lot of electricity to run instead it comes down to the fact it is plugged in and drawing power for a significant amount of time a fridge freezer is plugged in for 24 hours a day seven days a week and even though modern fridge freezers have good energy efficiency mechanisms to limit their usage they can very easily use 427 kwh a year leading to an annual cost of over 50 to put that into perspective heres how much your other household items cost per hour according to the same equation used earlier whats new as our homes workplaces and industries have become more energy efficient the country as a whole is using less power nowhere is this more evident than in our lighting  today the common led lightbulb uses just 17 of the power needed for an incandescent lightbulb of equivalent brightness the news has been full of stories about how much more power 4k tvs use compared to high definition tvs but because most of us buy a tv once every decade or so replacing your 2007 1080p full hd tv with the uks bestselling 4k model and watching it for an hour will actually use around 70 less power this continued trend towards efficiency has had a marked effect on the countrys use of power in march 2017 the government published its latest electricity demand data for the uk  showing the countrys power needs falling all the way through to 2020 but then something interesting happens from 2026 the forecast shows us beginning to use increasingly more power than we are due to in 2017 to the point where by 2035 were using more power than we are today  19 more why is this one possibility is electric cars in 2015 electric vehicles evs consumed 025 twh of power but thats set to grow significantly in its future energy scenarios report published in 2016 national grid projected evs will consume 19 twh in 2035 but it has already said it believes its projections might be understated  in short the ev revolution could drive demand far higher which leads to the question where is all of this extra power going to come from  understanding the smart home our future energy needs are not just going to be met by more electricity generation capacity  they will also be assisted by something closer to home with the introduction of smart meters  pinpointing the devices and appliances in our homes that use the most electricity will become more widespread more than this well be able to identify what time of day theyre using the most energy and when we might be able to turn them off with this information we can optimise our usage and save money and while cutting down your yearly phone charging budget from 67p to 50p might not sound like much if three quarters of the country are joining you those pennies can quickly add up tags energy prices  technology  customers  investors  1  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to receive a
