will gardiner a net zero uk will be good for people and the planet will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 24 november 2020 opinion for the uk to reach net zero co 2 emissions by 2050 and do its part in tackling the biggest challenge of our time all sectors of the economy must reduce their emissions and do it quickly i believe the best approach to tackling climate change is through cobenefit solutions solutions that not only have a positive environmental impact but that are economically progressive for society today and in the future through training skills and job creation as an energy company this task is especially important for drax we have a responsibility to future generations to innovate and use our engineering skills to deliver power thats renewable sustainable and that doesnt come at a cost to the environment wwwdraxcomcaptureit our work on zero carbon humber  in partnership with 11 other forwardthinking organisations aims to deploy the negative emissions technology beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as well as ccus carbon capture usage and storage in industry and power and ramp up hydrogen production as a low carbon fuel these are all essential technologies in bringing the uk to net zero but they are also innovative projects at scale that can benefit society and the lives of people in the humber and around the uk new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and hydrogen are essential steps towards modernising these businesses and protecting up to 55000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the region capturing carbon at drax delivering jobs clean growth and levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station north yorkshire i believe we must continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light we can help ensure the uks biomass sourcing is led by the latest science  best practice and transparency  supporting healthy biodiverse forests around the world and even apply it internationally global leadership delivering deep decarbonisation for the uk will require collaboration from industries government and society what we can achieve through largescale projects like zero carbon humber is more than just the vital issue of reduced emissions it is also about creating jobs protecting health and improving livelihoods these are more than just benefits they are the makings of a future filled with opportunity for the humber and for the uks green industrial

inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business debtline  a dedicated phoneline and webpage will be provided to our small businesses customers offering free debt advice and helping them to recover for the future an engineer looks up at flue gas

the future recovery while there is still uncertainty around how the uk the us and the world will emerge from the pandemic it is the responsibility of the whole energy industry to show compassion for its customers and to take the actions needed to soften the economic blow that covid19 is having across the globe the disruption to normal life caused by the pandemic has changed how the country uses electricity overnight in the coming weeks we will be publishing a more indepth view from electric insights showing exactly what effect this has had and what it might reveal for the future of energy no matter what that future holds however we will remain committed to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future this will mean not only supporting our people our communities and our countries

independent advisory board on sustainable biomass will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 january 2020 opinion dear john thank you for your letter of the 9 january detailing the findings and recommendations from the first meeting of the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass i want to begin by reiterating how important the work of the iab is to draxs purpose and ambition as you know we recently announced our intention to become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030 by scaling up our pioneering biomass with ccs beccs pilot project this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use makes a positive contribution to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate to that end both you and the iab will play a vital role by guiding us on our sourcing choices and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i enjoyed meeting with the iab and hearing your conclusions from the first meeting i am also pleased to hear from my team that the longer discussions were useful and constructive please pass on my thanks to all the members of the iab for their time and consideration in particular i am grateful for their consideration of our new sustainable biomass sourcing policy and the insight and recommendations that were given i am pleased to hear that you agree our policy is an accurate representation of the criteria laid down in the forest research report i agree that a key topic for us to explore is how science can be further developed with regards the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood i also agree that understanding the counter factuals in the usage of wood that has come to us is important this is an area we have and continue to explore and i would refer the iab to a report we have published subsequent to the meeting catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends 2019  which contains an independent analysis of the impact of our sourcing at our amite pellet mill in mississippi the team look forward to discussing this with you at a future meeting and receiving your input to shape the next phases of this work i also agree the need to continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light as well as ensure that the current policy is embedded into our operations for that reason our policy will be kept under regular review to accommodate changes in science and new evidence as it emerges we have also committed to advancing scientific research in the areas applicable to our operations through partnerships with academic institutions and direct support for academic research with regards your suggestion of a restatement of the academic evidence on biomass sustainability we shall give this interesting approach due consideration i do believe that better alignment through a shared understanding of the evidence among the academic community environmental groups policy makers and industry would be a welcome development and would be grateful to the iab for its further consideration of how this might be achieved i will also raise your considerations regarding the sustainable biomass program spb in my position a member of the spb board you are correct that our new policy goes beyond sbp and so an important work programme for us is how we demonstrate we are meeting the new policy lastly i welcome the addition of two interim telephone calls which will help to keep momentum between the half yearly meetings and will support us as we develop our policy research and implementation projects further thank you for this commitment as the work of the iab progresses i look forward to hearing how you believe drax can best build the evidence required to demonstrate that we are sourcing according to the best available science as the worlds largest biomass consumer it is important that we lead by example this means not only having a world leading biomass sustainability policy in place but also the data and evidence available to give all our stakeholders the confidence that we are fulfilling our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future thank you once again for your

much nick its a pleasure to be here in madrid my name is will gardiner and i am the ceo of the drax group we have been proud members of the powering past coal alliance for a year now but our journey beyond coal began more than a decade ago when we realised that we had a responsibility to our communities our shareholders and our colleagues to be part of the solution to the escalating climate crisis and so at drax we did something that many believed wasnt possible and began to replace coal generation with sustainable renewable biomass  with the right support and commitment from successive uk ministers and through the ingenuity of our people within a decade we transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project and its biggest source of renewable power  generating 12 of the uks renewable electricity last year while reducing our carbon emissions by more than 80 since 2012 we have reduced our emissions we believe more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of uk workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable flexible and low carbon power for 13 million british homes but as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down we cant stand still so today i am pleased to share our new ambition to move beyond carbon neutrality to achieve something that nobody has before and become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030  by applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce while continuing to produce about 5 of the uks overall electricity needs as the ipcc and uk governments committee on climate change make clear  negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earths temperature rise to 15 degrees  at drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal if we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind the uk is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way we are second to none in deploying renewables like offshore wind and bioenergy  which have transformed lives and our postindustrial communities we need to apply a similar framework to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as made offshore wind so successful fundamentally an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical the government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime with confidence in that regulatory framework many businesses provided investment and innovation as a result offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts mw of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8000 mw in 2018  an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 75 of the uks electricity at the same time the cost of that electricity has declined from 114mwh in 2015 to 39mwh in 2019 the latter being a cost that will make offshore wind viable without subsidy with government support and an effective regulatory regime to give the private sector the confidence to invest and innovate bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will trace that same path at the same time investing in this technology will both save lots of existing jobs and create many next generation green technology jobs that is why we have founded along with equinor and national grid zero carbon humber  to work with the government to bring carbon capture and storage infrastructure to the northeast of the uk we can save 55000 existing heavy industry jobs while capturing as much as 30 million tons of co 2 per year at the same time we will create a new industry and also the infrastructure for a new hydrogen economy to take our decarbonisation further by creating the right conditions for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to flourish britain can continue to benefit  socially economically and environmentally from being at the vanguard of the fight against climate change and at the same time it is our ambition at drax to play a major role in that fight by becoming the first carbon negative company thank you read the press release drax sets worldfirst ambition to become

to carbon capture in a net zero uk will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 july 2019 opinion the starting gun has fired and the challenge is underway the government has officially set 2050 as the target year in which the uk will achieve carbon neutrality  theres no denying this economywide transformation will need a great deal of investment reaching net zero carbon emissions will require an evolutionary overhaul of not just great britains electricity system but the uk economy as a whole and indeed the way we live our lives and go about our business but that doesnt mean its out of reach instead it will fall to technologies such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to make it economical and possible the secret to making decarbonisation affordable the uks committee on climate change ccc estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1 of forecast gdp per annum in 2050 however the business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee inquiry found that failure to deploy ccus and beccs technology could double the cost to 2 there are a number of reasons for this such as the cost to jobs productivity and living standards of shutting down industrial emitters ccuss ability to contribute to a hydrogen economy can help avoid this moreover the ccc claims even with industries striving to decarbonise rapidly as much as 100 megatonnes of hardtoabate carbon dioxide co 2  is expected to remain in the uk economy by 2050 this makes carbon negative techniques and technologies  such as beccs  which uses woody biomass that has absorbed carbon in its lifetime as forests  alongside direct air capture dac the boosting of ocean plant productivity much greater tree planting and better sequestration of carbon in soil essential if the uk is to attain true carbon neutrality the importance of beccs and ccus in the zero carbon future is clear now is the time for rapid development not in 2030 not in 2040 but today in 2019 and into the 2020s but doing this requires the government to move beyond its historic policies that have failed to support the technology in the past progress needs longterm frameworks that provide private sector investors with the certainty they need to kickstart the commercialscale deployment of ccus technologies laying down the tracks to negative emissions for carbon capture to become an integrated part of the energy system it must deliver value well beyond the energy sector establishing markets for products developed from captured carbon will play a role here but to set the wheels in motion financial frameworks are needed that can allow beccs and ccus to thrive one device that can allow the market to develop ccus is the creation of contracts for difference cfds for carbon capture these currently exist in the lowcarbon generation space between generators and the governmentowned low carbon contracts company  lccc  through these contracts power generators are paid the difference between their cost of generating low carbon electricity known as a strike price and the price of electricity in great britains wholesale power market if the power price in the market is higher than the strike price generators pay the difference back to the lccc meaning consumers are protected from price spikes too it means that the generator is protected from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power offering the security to invest in new technology more than this cfds last many years meaning they transcend political cycles and the cost per megawatt can be reduced with a longer contract creating a market for carbon capture or negative emissions generation could offer the same security to generators to invest in the technology a cfd for beccs should not only incentivise the building of infrastructure to capture carbon but we must also recognise the valuable role that negative emissions can play by compensating beccs producers for their negative emissions it should provide a lower cost alternative to reducing all other co2 emissions to zero while still ensuring that the uk can get to net zero beyond installing carbon capture at existing generation sites one of the major financial barriers to the wider deployment of ccus and beccs is the cost and liability associated with transporting and storing captured carbon a regulated asset base rab funding model would encourage investment by gradually recovering the costs of transport and storage via a regulated return this approach is currently under consideration as a means of financing other major infrastructure projects  a rab allows businesses including investment and pension funds to invest in projects under the oversight of a government regulator in exchange for their commitment investors can collect a fee through regular consumer and nondomestic bills led by industry guided by government ultimately the current carbon trading system is based around charging polluters but as we approach a postcoal uk and in order to achieve net zero its necessary for this to evolve  from economically disincentivising emissions to incentivising carbonnegative power generation however with the cost of carbon capture and negative emissions differing between types of industries and technologies theres a requirement to consider differentiated carbon prices to guide industry through longterm strategy but the need for carbon capture development is too pressing for us as an industry to wait at drax power station our beccs pilot is just the beginning of our wider ambitions to become the first negative emissions power station our use of biomass already makes drax power station the largest generator of renewable electricity in great britain the responsiblymanaged working forests our suppliers source from absorbed carbon from the atmosphere as they grew so adding carbon capture at scale to this supply chain can turn our operation from low carbon to carbonneutral and eventually carbon negative and we have bigger plans still to create a net zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region  in partnership with equinor and national grid the cluster would deliver carbon capture at the scale needed to not just decarbonise the most carbonintensive industrial region in the uk but to put the country at the forefront of the decarbonisation of industry and manufacturing government action is needed to make ccus and beccs economically sustainable at scale as an integrated part of our energy system however the onus is on us the energy industry to lead development and act as trusted partners that can deliver the decarbonisation needed to reach net zero carbon by 2050 learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series

efforts to decarbonise greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43 below 1990 levels  while increasing renewable electricity generation and a strengthening carbon price means the country could soon go coalfree for an entire summer  there is still however much work needed to reach the uk target of reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the paris agreements aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius as ambitious as these goals may be recent research by the energy transitions commission etc believes they can be met by 2050 with the right government policies and action from businesses to help to mitigate man made climate change all industries across all sectors must cut carbon emissions its a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation this step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation transforming what was once western europes largest coalfired power station into the uks biggest decarbonisation project this puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed  across the electricity industry and other sectors  to reach a zerocarbon world electricity generation will lead decarbonisation the electrification of carbonintensive sectors such as transport and heating will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zerocarbon sources the etcs research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85 of the worlds electricity generation by 2050 when these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15 will come from a combination of nuclear hydro biomass and storage including batteries pumped storage and new technologies in fact biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15 but it is critical that this flexible renewable low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced for the wood biomass we use at drax power station its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests which will be another key part of the climate change solution will gardiner ceo drax group at drax we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of our own biomass pellet supply chain  from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading the skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chainbased industries along the path to lowercarbon emissions more than this it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this from here to zerocarbon one of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage were leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a sixmonth pilot of a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs system which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four 600 megawatt mw biomass units capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds but also opens new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon  for drax beccs takes us another step towards becoming a carbon negative operation  where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit it is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which will be essential in meeting climate change goals  alongside this our plans to repower the last of our coalfired units to highlyefficient combined cycle gas turbines ccgt and build four rapidresponse open cycle gas turbines ocgt will give the electricity system the flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources  the abilities of gas plant in balancing and system services can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025 in subsequent decades gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zerocarbon power system our retail businesses haven power and opus energy  also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint beyond just supplying renewable electricity were also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs reaching a zerocarbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers

about us  investors  will gardiner chief executives review will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 annual report market background the uk is undergoing an energy revolution  a transition to a lowcarbon economy requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy through our flexible lower carbon electricity proposition and business to business b2b energy solutions the group is positioning itself for growth in this environment more details can be seen on page 4 of our annual report  our strategy our purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used through addressing uk energy needs and those of our customers our strategy is designed to deliver growing earnings and cash flow alongside significant cash returns for shareholders our ambition is to grow our ebitda to over 425 million by 2025 with over a third of those earnings coming from pellet production and b2b energy supply to create a broader more balanced earnings profile we intend to pay a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders progression towards these targets is underpinned by safety sustainability operational excellence and expertise in our markets summary of 2017 we made significant progress during 2017 but were below our expectations on the challenging scorecard targets we set ourselves in pellet production and biomass availability the latter reflecting the significant incident we experienced on our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2017 which extended into january 2018 energy supply performed well with opus energy in line with plan and haven power exceeding its targets through a combination of this performance and the progress of our strategy we have delivered ebitda of 229 million significantly ahead of 2016 140 million and with each of our three businesses contributing positive ebitda for the first time the group scorecard is reported in full in the remuneration report  pp 81107 of our annual report  and the kpis are also shown below they reflect the diversity of our operations and our need to maintain clear focus on delivering operational excellence on a statutory basis we recorded a loss of 151 million which reflects unrealised losses on derivative contracts previously announced accounting policy on the accelerated depreciation on coalspecific assets as well as amortisation of newly acquired intangible assets in opus energy we also calculate underlying earnings a profit after tax of 27 million which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and to assess the performance of the group without the income statement volatility introduced by noncash fair value adjustments on our portfolio of forward commodity and currency futures contracts during the year we refinanced our existing debt facilities reducing our debt cost we also confirmed a new dividend policy which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend 50 million in respect of 2017 consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth at year end our net debt was 91 million below our 2x net debt to ebitda target providing additional headroom there is more detail on our financial performance in the group financial review on page 46 of our annual report  in the us our pellet production operations recorded yearonyear growth in output of 35 with our first two plants now producing at full capacity during the second half of 2017 we also completed the installation of additional capacity enabling our morehouse and amite facilities to handle a greater amount of residue material supporting efforts to produce good quality pellets at the lowest cost as part of our target to expand our biomass selfsupply capability we completed the acquisition of lasalle bioenergy lasalle adding pellet production capacity lasalle commenced commissioning in november 2017 and due to its close proximity to our existing us facilities once complete will provide further opportunities for supply chain optimisation as in 2016 we benefited from the flexibility of selfsupply this often overlooked attribute of our supply chain enables us to manage biomass supply across the power generation business planned outage season and to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the shortterm spot market in power generation we experienced a significant incident on our biomass rail unloading facilities including a small fire on a section of conveyor we fully investigated the incident and following repairs over the christmas period have now recommissioned the facility with enhanced operating procedures this is a timely reminder of the combustible nature of biomass and the need for strong controls and processes to protect our people and assets our biomass units continued to produce high levels of renewable electricity from sustainable wood pellets for the uk market  drax produced 15 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power sheffield leeds liverpool and manchester combined in doing so we are making a vital contribution to the uks ambitious targets for decarbonisation across electricity generation heating and transport  an 80 reduction by 2050 vs 1990 levels we benefited from the first year of operation of our third biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd scheme which provides an indexlinked price for the power produced until march 2027 the unit underwent a major planned outage between september and november with a full programme of works successfully completed the flexibility reliability and scale of our renewable generation alongside an attractive total system cost means we are strongly placed to play a longterm role in the uks energy mix to that end we continue to see longterm biomass generation as a key enabler allowing the uk government to meet its decarbonisation targets and the system operator to manage the grid the uk government recently confirmed support for further biomass generation at drax power station and we now plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  allowing us to provide even more renewable electricity whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer our heritage is coal but our future is flexible lowercarbon electricity we are making progress with the development of four new standalone ocgt plants situated in eastern england and wales and our work to develop options for coaltogas repowering with battery technologies  if these options would be supported by 15year capacity market contracts providing a clear investment signal and extending visibility of contractbased earnings out to the late 2030s in b2b energy supply we completed the acquisition of opus energy a supplier of electricity and gas to corporates and small businesses the transaction completed in february 2017 and opus energy has continued to operate successfully within the group achieving its targets and making an immediate and significant contribution to profitability alongside this good performance we have also implemented the operational steps necessary to realise further operational benefits of the acquisition and we now source all of opus power and gas internally haven power delivered a strong performance with the sale of large volumes of electricity to industrial customers through our customer focus and efficiencies margins have improved and the business generated a positive ebitda for the first time together our b2b energy supply business now has over 375000 customer meters making it the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk we are delivering innovative lowcarbon power solutions with 46 of our energy sold from renewable sources as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power we see this as a significant opportunity for the group in the medium to long term in october 2017 we completed the sale of billington bioenergy bbe to aggregated micro power holding amph consideration for the transaction was 23 million comprised of 16 million of shares in amph and 07 million of cash the sale of bbe is aligned with our strategy to focus on b2b energy supply however through our shareholding in amph we will retain an interest in the uk heating market whilst gaining exposure to the development of smallscale distributed energy assets political regulatory and economic background we continue to operate in a changing environment the full impact of the uks decision to leave the eu is still unknown the immediate impact on the group was a weakening of sterling and an associated increase in the cost of biomass which is generally denominated in other currencies through our utilisation of mediumterm foreign exchange hedges the group protected the cash impact of this weakness in 2017 sterling has generally strengthened and we have been able to extend our hedged position out to 2022 at rates close to those that we saw before brexit in terms of uk energy policy the governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts svt are not a common feature of the b2b market at the microbusiness end of this market which is closer in size to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are active in renewing contracts the uk governments response to its consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 has confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by october 2025 we believe our assets projects and ability to support our customers electricity management will support the governments ambition to maintain reliability when coal generation ceases running a resilient reliable grid is not simply about meeting the power demand on the system there are also system support services which are essential to its effective operation as the grid decentralises and becomes dependent on smaller distributed generation the number of plants able to provide these services is reducing biomass generation our proposed ocgts and our repowering project would allow us to meet these needs but this will not come for free a reliable flexible lowcarbon energy system will require the right longterm incentives in november 2017 the government confirmed that the uk will maintain a total carbon price the combined uk carbon price support  cps  and the european union emissions trading scheme  eu ets at around the current level cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing the level of carbon emissions in generation and we continue to support the pricing of carbon a view echoed in a report prepared for the uk government by the leading academic professor dieter helm against this backdrop we continue to make an important contribution to the uk economy according to a study published by oxford economics in 2016  draxs total economic impact  including our supply chain and the wages our employees and suppliers employees spend in the wider consumereconomy was 17 billion supporting 18500 jobs across the uk safety sustainability and people the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is vital to the group with safety at the centre of our operational philosophy we also recognise the growing need to support the wellbeing of our employees and their mental health during the year we continued to use total recordable injury rate trir as our primary kpi in this area performance was positive at 027 but we expect this to improve in the coming year the incident at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did not lead to physical injuries but was nonetheless a significant event and caused disruption into 2018 we consequently launched an incident investigation to ensure our personal and process safety management procedures are robust to promote greater awareness around wellbeing we have embedded this in our new people strategy and expect to focus more energy and resources on this important area during 2018 strong corporate governance is at the heart of the group  acting responsibly doing the right thing and being transparent as the group grows the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and recognising the importance of strong corporate governance  we have published a comprehensive overview of our sustainability progress in 2017 on our website  this also highlights future priorities to broaden our approach to sustainability and improved reporting of environment  social and governance esg performance we have also completed the process which allows us to participate in the un global compact ungc  an international framework which will guide our approach in the areas of human rights labour environment and anticorruption during 2017 we published our first statement on the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in compliance with the uk modern slavery act we have added modern slavery awareness to our programme of regular training for contract managers and reviewed our counterparty due diligence processes we have continued to maintain our rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability  ensuring the wood pellets we use are sustainable lowcarbon and fully compliant with the uks mandatory sustainability standards for biomass the biomass we use to generate electricity provides a 64 carbon emissions saving against gas inclusive of supply chain emissions our biomass lifecycle carbon emissions are 36g co 2  mj less than half the uk governments 79g co 2  mj limit our people are a key asset of the business through 2017 we developed a new people strategy the strategy focuses on driving performance and developing talent to deliver the groups objectives we have established groupwide practices including a career development and behaviour framework focused on performance and personal development research and innovation a key part of our strategy is to identify opportunities to improve existing operations and create options for longterm growth to that end we have established a dedicated research and innovation ri team led by the drax engineers who delivered our worldfirst biomass generation and supply chain solution we are actively looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our operations notably in our biomass supply chain biomass is our largest single cost and as such we are focused on greater supply chain efficiency and the extraction of value from a wide range of lowvalue residue materials in b2b energy supply we are using our engineering expertise to help offer our customers valueadding services and products which will improve efficiency and allow them to optimise their energy consumption in the following sections we review the performance of our businesses during the year performance review pellet production our pellets provide a sustainable lowcarbon fuel source  one that can be safely and efficiently delivered through our global supply chain and used by draxs power generation business to make renewable electricity for the uk our manufacturing operations also promote forest health by incentivising local landowners to actively manage and reinvest in their forests  operational review safety remains our primary concern and we have delivered yearonyear reduction in the level of recordable incidents output at our amite and morehouse pellet plants increased significantly although was below our target for the year we have remained focused on opportunities to improve efficiencies and capture cost savings as part of our drive to produce good quality pellets at the lowest possible cost we still have more work to do in this area to optimise quality and cost as our performance was below target for the year as part of our plans to optimise and improve operations we added 150k tonnes capacity at our existing plants bringing total installed capacity to 11 million tonnes and increasing the amount of lower cost sawmill residues we are able to process and used in our pellets  case study lowcost highimpact capacity increase byproducts of higher value wood industries such as sawdust from sawmills offer a lowcost source of residues for use in our pellet production process and during 2017 we added an additional 150k tonnes of capacity at our pellet plants to allow us to use more of this material by investing in giant hydraulic platforms known as truck dumps operators at amite and morehouse can unload a 50foot truck carrying either sawdust or wood chips and weighing 60 tonnes in less than two minutes increasing processing capacity reducing the cost of processing and increasing the use of lower cost residues find out more wwwdraxcomtruckdumps and wwwdraxcomsustainabilitysourcing at our baton rouge port facility greater volumes of production from our facilities drove higher levels of throughput with 17 vessels loaded and dispatched during the year 2016 11 vessels in april in line with our strategy to increase selfsupply we acquired a 450k tonne wood pellet plant  lasalle bioenergy lasalle commissioning of the plant began in november 2017 and we expect to increase production through 2018 lasalle is within a 200mile radius of our existing facilities by leveraging the locational benefits

volumes raw fibre procurement transportation and processing comprised the majority of cost of sales and as such this remains an important area of focus and an opportunity for the business through incremental investment in plant enhancements we expect to see further benefits from efficiencies and greater utilisation of lower cost residues total operating costs have increased reflecting an

station remains the largest power station in the uk almost twice the size of the next largest during the year the station met 6 of the uks electricity needs whilst providing 15 of its renewable electricity alongside important system support services  with an increase in intermittent renewables and a reduction in the responsive thermal generation historically provided by coal  the system of

target to reduce 2050 carbon emissions by 80 versus 1990 levels across electricity generation heating and transport this reinforces the drax proposition  flexible reliable lowcarbon electricity in november the government updated its intentions regarding the future trajectory of uk carbon price support cps indicating that the total cost of carbon tax in the uk the total of cps and the eu emissions trading scheme would continue at around the current level  the tax is currently set at 18tonne  whilst coal remains on the system we believe that cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing carbon emissions from generation and that having an appropriate price for carbon emissions is the right way to provide a market signal to further reduce emissions in support of the uks longterm decarbonisation targets the uk government has now confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by 2025 we support this move subject to an appropriate alternative technology being in place with this in mind we have continued to develop options for our remaining coal assets to convert to biomass or gas to provide the reliable flexible capacity which we believe will be required to manage the increasingly volatile energy system of the future most recently with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply generation capacity and system support 2017 saw the first full year of operation of our biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd mechanism which provides indexlinked revenues for renewable electricity out to 2027 our other biomass units are supported by the renewable obligation certificate roc mechanism which similar to the cfd is also indexlinked to 2027 this acts as a premium above the price of power we sell from these units we sell power forward to the extent there is liquidity in the power markets which combined with our fuel hedging strategy provides longterm earnings and revenue visibility lower gas prices higher carbon costs and the continued penetration of intermittent renewables have kept wholesale electricity prices subdued with increasing levels of intermittent renewables we are continuing to see opportunities to extract value from flexibility  shortterm power and balancing market activity the provision of ancillary services and the value achieved from outofspecification fuels  to capture value in this market we continue to focus resource on optimising availability and flexibility of both coal and biomass units this whole process requires a high level of teamwork between the operational and commercial teams across the group to capture and protect value over the period 2017 to 2022 we expect to earn 90 million from a series of oneyear capacity market contracts for our coal units demonstrating that they still have a role to play the first of these contracts commenced in october 2017 adding 3 million to ebitda lastly we continue to source attractively priced fuel cargoes  outofspecification coals and distressed cargoes which help keep costs down for the business and consumers we do this for both coal and biomass this is a good example of how our commercial and operational teams work together to identify opportunities to create value for the business as these fuels typically require more complex handling processes you can follow the market and see prices at electricinsightscouk strategy in progress repowering away from coal options for drax power station to operate into the late 2030s and beyond moved up a gear in 2017 with the development of an option

the cfd contract this unit provides stable and reliable baseload renewable electricity to the network and longterm earnings visibility for the group the safe and efficient completion of these complex works is a credit to those involved and reflects our continued focus on opportunities for improvement and efficiencies the entire organisation has responded to a number of challenging unplanned events most notably in december we experienced a fire on a section of conveyor at our biomass rail unloading facility and consequently an unplanned outage from late december 2017 to midjanuary 2018 following investigation and recommissioning the facility has returned to service with enhanced operating procedures although this issue did not relate to the operation of the biomassgenerating units the resulting restriction on fuel deliveries by rail required the optimisation of generation across our biomass units resulting in lower ebitda and full year biomass availability than our target for the year financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 238 million 2016 174 million principally due to the cfd mechanism value from flexibility was below our target for the year principally reflecting a lower level of ancillary service payments versus 2016 our operational performance drives the results the financial impact of the unplanned outage on the rail unloading facility was mitigated by optimisation of our available biomass and the use of additional generation capacity retained for selfinsurance purposes however this incident is a reminder of the need to invest appropriately to maintain a high level of operational availability and flexibility at the operating cost level we have reduced costs reflecting the efficient single outage and our focus

shortterm power markets  we will also continue to explore opportunities for lower carbon generation to exploit our strengths and create opportunities for the long term to that end we will continue to develop options for gas and pursue efficiencies through our biomass supply chain performance review b2b energy supply our b2b energy supply business  comprised of opus energy and haven power  is the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power the key factors influencing our business are regulation competition and our operational performance regulation and competition the uk governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts the government will take forward legislation which will provide the regulator ofgem with the authority to cap these domestic tariffs svts are not a feature of our business our focus remains on the b2b market at the microbusiness end of the market which is closer in proximity to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are actively rather than passively renewing their power supply contracts the b2b market remains competitive with 65 different suppliers across the market our haven power and opus energy businesses offer customercentric power gas and services we offer simplicity and flexibility across our products and actively engage with customers to help them manage their energy requirements and reduce carbon emissions strategy in progress an innovative energy supplier 90 of the electricity that opus energy supplied last year came from clean renewable sources at no extra cost to their predominantly small and mediumsized business customers for those customers who want it 100 renewable energy contracts are also available  this was exactly what all saints church in ascot was looking for to power their business assistant church warden chris gunton commented we wanted to move to a greener energy supplier without paying a premium so approached an energy broker for guidance they advised us that opus energy were a reliable company with a good reputation and when we asked for a quote they were the most competitive it was a similar story for the salisbury museum in wiltshire nicola kilgourcroft finance manager said we were looking for an energy supplier that offered great value combined with the right length of contract and good ethics opus energy ticked all these boxes for us alongside supplying customers opus energy has power purchase agreements with over 2300 independent uk renewable energy generators these could be anything from a single wind turbine owned by a village community  to europes greenest zoo hamerton zoo park commented andrew swales director of hamerton zoo working with opus energy has given us competitive prices considerably better documentation and a highly efficient service wed happily recommend them operational review we have remained focused on delivering an excellent standard of customer service which is central to our proposition february 2017 saw the completion of the acquisition of opus energy which has made good progress integrating into the group supported by a dedicated team who have been working on systems people and commercial projects to ensure our processes work effectively together in march we completed the purchase of a new office facility in northampton  enabling the consolidation of four opus energy offices into one and the centralisation of the operational teams sales volumes at opus energy were lower than target reflecting our focus on margin which has remained strong and customer renewal rates were towards the high end of expectation this reflects the continued commitment to a strong level of customer service and in recognition of this opus energy was awarded utility provider to small businesses of the year 2017 at the british business awards  at haven power we have continued to focus on valueadding flexible products and services particularly to industrial  commercial customers whose needs extend beyond commodity supply this is demonstrated through our ability to help customers manage and optimise their power consumption profiles through collaboration with our carefully selected partners through better systems and services customer targeting and a keener focus on cost to serve we are driving efficiencies and improved margin at haven power following the acquisition of opus
