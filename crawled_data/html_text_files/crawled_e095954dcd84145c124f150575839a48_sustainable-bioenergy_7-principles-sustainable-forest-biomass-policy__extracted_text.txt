decarbonisation but it must be created and used sustainably this relies on the right regulation guided by solid principles 28 november 2017 sustainable bioenergy biomass is playing an important role in moving the uk away from coal at drax power station in the form of compressed wood pellets  biomass is already supplying roughly 17 of great britains renewable power  but more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network among renewable sources of power biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations  such as frequency control and inertia  this inherrent flexibility is vital in maintaining stability on britains high voltage transmission system wood pellets can also reliably generate power helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine and avoiding reliance on diesel coal and gas however for the uk and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass it must be produced sustainably more than this its supply chain must be low in emissions so that clear savings can be made versus power generation with fossil fuels to ensure this the use of biomass is regulated in the uk under eu timber regulations and the renewables obligation ro  but further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the european parliaments update to the renewable energy directive red which will specify criteria for all biomass there is a clear need for this but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles a new report by drax outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future 1 forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests the sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental social and economic health of that supply region for example a properly managed forest can boost carbon stock as the younger faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more co 2 than older overmature trees thinning operations also increase the growth of the biggest and best trees  ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higherrisk areas where extracting biomass could cause longterm carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss soil erosion or depletion of water sources 2 bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from highrisk feedstocks feedstocks the raw materials turned into biomass pellets must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk in 2016 around 40 of all feedstock supplied to drax originated as a sawmill residue  processes such as thinning also serve as a source of biomass feedstock while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest thinning a semi mature stand of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value sawtimber trees storing more carbon and generating more stable revenue streams having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises land owners to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development 3 carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted to understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy carbon savings need to be measured factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure 4 bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied unlike coal or oil which will eventually run out more trees can be planted grown and harvested that said there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet and so it should not be considered an infinite resource this is why its crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines in short to ensure biomass truly is sustainable it is essential that working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity  5 support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings one of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the uk rapidly adapt to meet the eu target of achieving 27 of final energy consumption from renewables the fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the uks carbon emissions is through converting coal power stations to biomass  as is the case at drax power station this repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources cant quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise 6 the efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets globally there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry byproducts that currently go unused biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained to enable this to function effectively on a global scale trade restrictions should be avoided pelletisation offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe costefficient and lowcarbon to transport around the world these principals are tried and tested by drax and known to protect forests and ecosystems  as well as optimise supply chains to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum ultimately draxs experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems 7 the sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified one of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing thirdparties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with in europe forest level management certification schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by forest europe  outside of europe where drax sources most of its biomass  independent third part auditors can ensure the uks stringent criteria are being met on the ground read the full report the 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy  proven to
