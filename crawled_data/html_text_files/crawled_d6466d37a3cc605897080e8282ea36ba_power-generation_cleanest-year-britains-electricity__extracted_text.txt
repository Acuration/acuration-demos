power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station the cleanest year in britains electricity for the first time in its 130yearold history more than half of the electricity in england scotland and wales has been generated by lowcarbon sources 14 november 2016 power generation amid the political upheaval that is characterising 2016 you may have missed the quiet victory of the uks lowcarbon energy sector for the first time ever the third quarter q3 of 2016 saw more than 50 of the britains power come from lowcarbon energy sources five years ago lowcarbon sources made up just over a quarter this doesnt necessarily mean that renewable energy sources made up the full 50  in fact nuclear made up a considerable chunk  but it hints at the big changes were seeing in the way the country is sourcing its power for one its a further sign of coals diminishing life  during the period july to september 2012 coal supplied 38 of britains electricity  during this years q3 it supplied just 3 as a result perunit carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at their lowest levels ever the carbon price floor  also known as the carbon tax and designed to assist energy companies like drax invest in renewable and lower carbon generation  has played a big role in reducing coals contribution the findings come from electric insights  an independent report produced by researchers from imperial college london and commissioned by drax that looks at the uks publicly available electricity data and aims to inform the debate on britains electricity system beyond the continued decline of coal it shows theres a growing diversity in lowcarbon energy sources fuelling the country and that theres a positive outlook for a cleaner electricity future here we look at those lowcarbon sources and how their use has changed over the last five years nuclear at 26 of the total nuclear made up the largest proportion of lowcarbon power generation across q3 2016 that was good news for the sector which went through a turbulent summer after plans for the hinkley point c reactor were momentarily threatened following the dissolution of the department for energy and climate change decc after the brexit vote the eventual decision to continue with hinkley c however means that more baseload nuclear power in the form of large power stations and also possibly small modular nuclear reactors smrs will be coming on to the system in the coming years they will in the main replace older nuclear power stations set to be decommissioned wind wind power made up 10 of total lowcarbon power generation between july and september and was the largest renewable source of the quarter as recently as 2011 electricity generated by wind accounted for just 4 of britains low carbon energy supplies  a 150 increase in just five years this is in part due to huge offshore projects such as the 630 mw london array in the thames estuary and the 576mw gwynt y môr situated off the coast of north wales which have contributed to bringing the uks installed capacity to around 14 gw the uk is now the worlds sixth largest producer of wind power behind china the usa india germany and spain solar following wind power as the second largest renewable contributor to the countrys lowcarbon energy needs was solar five years ago solars contribution was so negligible it didnt even chart in the electric insights data fast forward to 2016 and britain has a total installed solar capacity of nearly 10 gw again this places the country sixth in the world for capacity behind china germany japan the usa and italy biomass biomass  a unique lowcarbon fuel in that it can deliver both baseload and flexible power  made up 4 of the uks power needs in q3 2016 a good proportion of that came from drax which has over the last five years been upgrading from coal to run on compressed wood pellets  like solar biomass generation didnt even chart in 2011 but today in fact between july and september biomass along with solar and wind supplied 20 of the countrys electricity  a huge proof point for the rise of renewables where biomass sits apart from those two sources however is that it isnt dependent on weather and even though the country has less much less biomass generation capacity than the two intermittent technologies it produces nearly as much energy as them this makes it an ideal baseload partner for sources that do ie wind and solar as it can be dialled up and down to meet the energy demand of the country in seconds in the future theres potential to increase this biomass capacity while saving bill payers money  three of draxs six generating units run on biomass but if all were to be upgraded as they could be in less than three years  drax plus lynemouth power station and one or two smaller biomass power stations  could generate roughly 10 of britains electricity using compressed wood pellets by the time unabated coal power stations come off the system before the end of 2025  hydro hydropower made up just 1 of britains power generation over the quarter however this is still up by 20 since 2011 when hydropower contributed just 08 total installed hydropower capacity is around 165gw however studies have found the country has a potential hydropower capacity of close to double this amount  but as many of these sources are located in mountainous rural landscape areas of natural importance its doubtful whether hydropower will be deployed up to its full capabilities in the coming years closing an historic year may the 5 th was an historic day in the uk  it was the first time since 1881 britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity it wasnt an isolated incident either in the third quarter of 2016 britain was completely coal free for nearly six days its a situation that is likely to continue in the future as low carbon energy sources  and in particular renewables  continue to grow in the countrys energy makeup the outlook is a positive one 2016 may have been the cleanest year in uk electricity weve seen so far but it wont be the cleanest year ever explore the data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric
