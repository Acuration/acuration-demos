progress with the strategy we announced in december 2016 first we completed the acquisition of opus energy  a leading challenger brand in the uk small and mediumsized enterprise sme energy market second we acquired a third biomass pellet plant  lasalle bioenergy  which significantly increases our pellet production capacity and third we continued to develop options for flexible gas generation at four sites around the uk we also began developing longerterm options for growth with the exploration of coaltogas repowering at drax power station  as we look to provide new sources of flexible generation backed up by longterm capacity contracts to support our strategy we completed a refinancing in may and announced a new dividend policy in june at the same time we have continued to provide a significant amount of the uks renewable electricity with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit conversion  allowing us to provide even more renewable electricity whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer opus energy performed well delivering on the plans we set out at the time of acquisition and in north america lasalle bioenergy is successfully commissioning this performance alongside safety sustainability and expertise in our core markets acts as a strong base from which the business can grow and deliver longterm sustainable value we have a major role to play in supporting the uk energy system as it becomes increasingly ambitious in decarbonising first the electricity sector and subsequently transport and heating in doing so through our flexible lowcarbon and customer focused approach we aim to deliver higher quality earnings with a reduction in commodity exposure alongside opportunities for growth our people  employees and contractors  remain a key asset of the business their safety remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we have performed well in this regard although we continue to work to improve our performance across the group results and dividend ebitda in 2017 of 229 million was significantly ahead of 2016 140 million this increase was principally from producing high levels of renewable power from sustainable biomass we also benefited from our growing b2b energy supply and pellet production businesses through these activities we are improving the visibility of our earnings in june we announced a new dividend policy this policy is to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows in determining the rate of growth in dividends the board will take account of contracted cash flows the less predictable cash flows from the groups commodity based business and future investment opportunities if there is a buildup of capital the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders at the 2017 half year results we confirmed an interim dividend of 20 million 49 pence per share representing 40 of the full year expected dividend of 50 million 123 pence per share 2016 10 million 25 pence per share accordingly the board proposes to pay a final dividend in respect of 2017 of 30 million equivalent to 74 pence per share in addition the board has decided to announce a 50 million share buyback programme which will take place during 2018 which is consistent with our capital allocation policy corporate governance in september dorothy thompson cbe announced her intention to stand down as group chief executive officer ceo i would like to thank dorothy for her enormous contribution to the group over the last 13 years during her tenure dorothy led the transformation of the business and leaves the group in a strong position with a clear strategy that lays the foundations for further success in a changing energy sector dorothy is succeeded by will gardiner  who was previously group chief financial officer cfo and a key architect of the strategy his appointment follows a thorough review of internal and external candidates and is a natural progression after two years working alongside dorothy developing a strategy which i am confident will create significant benefits for all draxs stakeholders a process to appoint a permanent cfo is underway and den jones has been appointed as interim cfo den is highly experienced having previously served as cfo of both johnson matthey and bg group drax remains committed to the highest standards of corporate governance the board and its committees play an active role in guiding the company and leading its strategy we greatly value the contribution made by our nonexecutive directors neds and during a time of transition their role is especially important we indicated last year that we were seeking additional neds with experience in sustainability and energy supply to complement our already experienced board i am therefore delighted to welcome two new neds to the drax board firstly david nussbaum  whose indepth knowledge of sustainability will support our continued focus in this area and secondly nicola hodson  whose experience in technology business transformation and energy will provide real value as the group delivers its strategy sustainability remains at the heart of the business both the specific sustainability of biomass and more broadly the longterm sustainability of the business as such i am pleased to note that alongside this years annual report and accounts the group has published a comprehensive overview of our sustainability progress in 2017 on our website  full details of our corporate governance can be found on page 64 of the 2017 annual report  our people as the group grows i would also like to welcome colleagues from opus energy and our other developments onboarding is proceeding well and by working together in our common goal to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used we are creating real value for all stakeholders i must thank all the employees and contractors who have worked so hard to help the group succeed in the last 12 months it is through their skill expertise and hard work that we are able to deliver our strategy for the business my sincere thanks to colleagues for their commitment and hard work it only remains for me to say that your board remains totally committed to the complementary aims of delivering sustainable longterm value for the group and of helping our country build a lowcarbon economy read the drax group plc annual report and accounts 2017 tags about us  corporate governance  financial reports  investors appointment of interim chief financial

corporate governance  investors  will gardiner forbes drax jointsecond most trustworthy company in europe will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2016 opinion im delighted that drax group plc has been named by forbes magazine and msci esg research as one of the 50 most trustworthy companies in europe  in fact drax came joint second across the whole continent among companies judged who consistently demonstrated transparent accounting practices and solid corporate governance its a massive tribute to everyone involved with drax that worldleading business experts have recognised our commitment to trust and integrity in this way of course that commitment goes much further than our accounting practices alone i believe my british colleagues would say that it runs right through drax like the writing in a stick of rock indeed it was one of the reasons i was so honoured to be asked to join drax as cfo  from my very first meeting with ceo dorothy thompson i could see that drax would always strive do the right thing in the right way thats just as true for our sustainability data as it is for our business data it was our commitment to doing the right thing that led drax to take on the decision to convert drax power station from coal to compressed wood pellets  it is our commitment to doing the right thing that means drax is reducing emissions by over 80 per cent while giving people and businesses all over the uk the reliable renewable power that they need and we know we can save billpayers money at the same time the uk is lagging far behind the rest of europe when it comes to generating energy from compressed wood pellets drax is committed to bringing us closer to the european average while helping us move from the fossil fuels of the past to the renewables of the future and yes you can trust us on that tags corporate governance  investors  sustainability  will gardiner  1 2 3 name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive
