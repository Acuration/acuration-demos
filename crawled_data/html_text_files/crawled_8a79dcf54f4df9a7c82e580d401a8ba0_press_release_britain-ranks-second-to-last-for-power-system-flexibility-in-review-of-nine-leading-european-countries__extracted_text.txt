flexibility in review of nine leading european countries britain which ranked eighth out of the nine countries in the index scored poorly on market factors such as a clear and stable regulatory and market framework 13 november 2019 britain ranks eighth out of nine northern european countries in attracting and facilitating investment in electricity system flexibility a new industry report finds delivering flexibility is crucial to power sector decarbonisation and achieving net zero targets regulatory uncertainty lack of visibility on returns and technical challenges connecting to the network are delaying investment in flexibility and could hamper renewables deployment in the 2020s regulatory uncertainty lack of visibility on returns and technical challenges are impeding investment in flexibility services to support britains electricity network as more renewables come online risking delays in the transition to a greener future an industry report said the energy transition readiness index  a report published by the association for renewable energy  clean technology rea and commissioned by eaton and drax reviewed regulation and market access social and political support for the energy transition and deployment of enabling technologies such as smart meters in nine northern european countries britain which ranked eighth out of the nine countries in the index scored poorly on market factors such as a clear and stable regulatory and market framework the report also highlighted potential difficulties accessing the distribution network and a lack of progress on delivering smart electric vehicle charging overall results of the energy transition readiness index illustrated by a country ranking flexibility is becoming increasingly important as more variable renewables such as wind and solar replace britains large fossilfuelled power stations to meet targets to cut carbon emissions large generators typically provided flexibility by supplying power during peak demand and ensuring that the systems voltage and frequency remained within operational limits the netherlands topped the league table of nine countries finland sweden denmark ireland and norway also scored high while germany britain and france lagged dr nina skorupska chief executive of the rea said decarbonising power means delivering flexibility in a world of very lowcost variable renewable electricity generation grids need to be organised differently and some services which were once taken for granted need to be actively procured crucially as renewable power prices fall around the world every country will be experiencing the same shift if britain becomes a flexibility pioneer then a whole world of markets for exporting our products and services opens up whilst this index shows were lagging behind theres still time to bounce back thats why the rea is calling for the next government to address the barriers to flexibility by delivering wholesale systems change and reform ofgem as a priority drax head of strategy robert riley said flexibility is essential to enable netzero carbon in britain for 2050 it reduces the risks of power cuts and builds resilience into the grid so that the system can handle the volume of intermittent renewables that well need without these flexibility services its going to be much harder and more costly to transition to a cleaner electricity system theres a huge potential for innovative flexible technologies to play a role more could be done to provide a level playing field and clarity on business models so that they can contribute to the zerocarbon ambition drax already provides a number of flexibility services in the uk including frequency management inertia and reserve power from its biomasspowered plant in yorkshire hydro in scotland and is looking to provide further flexibility services including from rapid response gas plants eaton head of energy storage business fabrice roudet said we welcome britains ambition and its strong policy commitment to decarbonisation encouraging new flexibility technologies and business models however we urgently need more clarity and an end to the flux to provide the certainty needed to spur private investment in the new technologies that will be required to ease the transition to a highrenewable energy future robert hull author of the report said in britain the strong ambition for the energy transition and growing flexibility markets hasnt yet translated into the market and regulatory framework which is complex and slow to change ends media contacts selina williams drax group

renewables such as wind and solar helps maximise the value of the renewable energy and gives customers more flexibility robert hull who authored the report  is an industry leader with over 30 years experience including at ofgem national grid and consultancy kpmg the report was based on contributions from utilities industry associations grid operators energy technology companies and academics in northern europe as well as publicly available data on the sector the northern european countries were selected for their similar ambitions on the energy transition the index ranked the countries as follows the netherlands finland sweden denmark ireland norway germany great britain france case study on battery energy storage drax has partnered with eaton to supply and connect battery storage systems to small businesses that are already customers of drax such as farms and offices so they can store power generated from onsite micro renewables like wind turbines and solar this allows draxs customers to maximise the value of the renewable energy they generate either using it when it is required or selling it back to the grid during peak demand drax and eaton have connected three eaton xstorage buildings storage systems and are installing another five by the end of this year and four early next year with a total capacity of around 600 kwh these are a mix of 40 kwh and 80 kwh capacity from new and secondlife batteries about rea the rea is the uks largest trade association for renewable energy and clean technologies with around 550 members operating across heat transport
