investors uk biomass strategy  highly supportive of biomass and a priority role for beccs 10 august 2023 investors the strategy outlines the potential extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon removals will gardiner drax ceo said will gardiner drax group ceo we welcome the uk governments clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that beccs can play in achieving the countrys climate goals the inclusion of beccs at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the uk wants to be a leader in carbon removals and drax is ready to deliver on this ambition we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in delivering beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire simultaneously providing reliable renewable power and carbon removals we look forward to working alongside the government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy through further progression of plans for beccs and ensuring an evidencedriven best practice approach to sustainability a priority role for beccs the strategy reiterates the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 with the potential for this to increase to 23mt by 2035 and up to 81mt by 2050 with beccs expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050 in the period to 2035 government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating whilst supporting projects transitioning to beccs beccs projects which includes drax power station are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and carbon capture and storage ccs technology ready to be deployed beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without beccs in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security the strategy notes the active work in government to support beccs including the development of business models biomass availability and sustainability the strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6 th carbon budget alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors a link to the strategy can be found here  scientific assessment of carbon removals from beccs alongside publication of the strategy the government has published an evidencebased assessment of beccs as a route to negative emissions the report sets out how well regulated beccs can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people the environment and the climate beccs at drax power station in march 2023 the government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of largescale powerbeccs projects by 2030 and that the drax power station beccs project had passed the deliverability assessment for the powerbeccs project submission process formal bilateral discussions with the government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 these discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of beccs at drax power station drax believes that beccs at drax power station is the only project in the uk that can enable the government to achieve this ambition in addition to the largescale renewable power and system support services it provides to the uk power system in july 2023 the government designated the viking ccs cluster as a track 2 cluster progressing a co 2 transport and storage network in the humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of highskilled jobs and energy security for decades to come along with the east coast cluster viking creates an additional potential pathway to support beccs at drax power station the government has also confirmed that during 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of its wider ccs programme for individual projects including beccs track 1 expansion and track 2 enquiries drax investor relations mark

and carbon removal technologies drax is a growing and sustainable international business providing flexible renewable energy and carbon removals solutions via beccs which put us at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security our plans to invest billions in critical renewable energy and carbon removal technologies will help to tackle the climate crisis and could create thousands of jobs whilst generating secure renewable power this investment is underpinned by our strong operational performance capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the groups strategy market opportunities and development projects including the progress drax is making in the development of beccs in north america and the opportunities this represents for the group purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies that increasingly recognise the role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change the groups three strategic pillars remain 1 to be a global leader in carbon removals 2 to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets and 3 to be a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation global need for carbon removals research by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 3  the worlds leading authority on climate science states that cdr methods including beccs are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit global warming to 15 o c all of the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the ipccs latest report use significant volumes of carbon removals including beccs as a key tool for mitigating climate change the ipcc believes that globally up to 95 billion tonnes of cdrs via beccs will be required per year by 2050 in the usa the supportive investment environment created by the inflation reduction act is stimulating action and robust pricing for cdrs beccs  north america over the past two years drax has been progressing a number of work streams to develop its options for beccs with a primary focus on north america drax has continued to develop plans for a newbuild beccs power unit capable of producing c2twh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and capturing c3mt of carbon per year two initial sites in the us south have been selected and are progressing to option although the precise details remain commercially sensitive the two sites combined could enable the capture of c6mt of carbon per year by 2030 total investment would be in the region of 2 billion per plant with a target fid in 2026 and commercial operation by 2030 the capital cost reflects the construction of newbuild power generation as well as carbon capture and storage ccs systems the design of newbuild beccs enables a wider choice of biomass materials including nonpelletised material such as woodchips drax aims to locate new plants in regions which are closer to sources of sustainable biomass and ts systems to permanently store co 2  this is expected to significantly reduce the operating cost of newbuild beccs compared to retrofit as well as carbon emissions in the supply chain the group is continuing to evaluate nine further sites in north america creating a pipeline of development opportunities into the 2030s commercial arrangements the commercial model for us beccs includes power purchase agreements longterm cdr offtake agreements and a direct pay tax incentive under the inflation reduction act of 85tonne drax believes that the role of highquality permanent removals such as beccs and direct air capture will grow significantly as governments and companies take action to address their own carbon footprints in september 2022 drax announced a memorandum of understanding mou for one of the worlds biggest carbon removals deal with respira a carbon broker under the terms of the mou respira will be able to purchase up to 2mt of cdrs over a fiveyear period from draxs north american beccs projects drax has also agreed mous with czero a carbon broker for the sale of cdrs at c300tonne resourcing to support the development of its beccs projects in north america drax has hired 80 employees across the us and canada and is in the process of establishing a global beccs headquarters in houston texas which will provide access to the highly skilled workforce needed to support the growth of this part of the group other developments in addition to newbuild beccs drax is currently developing an option for a project to add a carbon capture process to an existing pellet plant in louisiana the project would have the capacity to capture over 100k tonnes of co 2 per year from the pelleting process providing an early demonstration of the technology and creating cdrs which can help to stimulate this nascent market the project which has a capital cost in the region of 150 million is targeting fid in 202425 and commissioning in 2026 the group is also assessing options for beccs on existing nondrax assets and is continuing to screen other regions including europe and australasia capital allocation the group has previously outlined a fully funded plan to invest c3 billion in two beccs units at drax power station pellet production and pumped storage hydro today the group expands on this plan to include two newbuild beccs plants and ccs on a pellet plant increasing the total potential investment to c7 billion between 2024 and 2030 any final investment decisions will be subject to the achievement of project milestones including further progress on commercial arrangements as well as clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms reflecting strong expected cash generation from existing assets and new investments drax can fully fund the 7bn of opportunities and return to net debt to adjusted ebitda below 2x by the end of 2031 drax will also continue to assess a wider range of funding

by output than any other company during the difficult winter ahead we will continue to optimise our biomass operations to ensure that more renewable power is available when the country needs it most as governments around the world increasingly look to introduce supportive policies for carbon removals drax is considering more exciting global opportunities for deployment of beccs advancing our ambition to be a leader in this critical technology drax is a growing international business at the heart of the green energy transition and we are accelerating our plans to invest billions of pounds in critical renewable energy and carbon removal technologies which could create thousands of jobs and generate the secure renewable power that this planet urgently needs pellets production the groups sustainable biomass pellet business has continued to support efforts to optimise biomass power generation and security of supply in the uk at times of higher demand this winter as outlined at the groups half year results in july 2022 there has been an incremental increase in costs in north america primarily in transportation and utility costs these cost increases have continued in the second half of 2022 and taken together with costs incurred in providing supplyside flexibility production costs for the business are expected to be higher in 2022 and 2023 these increased costs have been considered in an adjusted transfer price which was implemented in the second half of the 2022 drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce the cost of biomass but will balance this against the need to optimise its supply chain to deliver value for the group in the second half of 2022 drax commissioned a second 40kt satellite plant at russellville arkansas and in august 2022 drax acquired a 90kt pellet plant in princeton british columbia from princeton standard pellet corporation in addition following commissioning in the first half of 2022 both the demopolis alabama and leola arkansas pellet plants have continued to work towards full production and these four plants combined will add over 500kt of full production capacity investment in new production capacity drax has taken a final investment decision fid to invest in two new pellet production projects  a 450kt newbuild pellet plant at longview washington state including the development of a new port facility at this location and a 130kt expansion of its aliceville site alabama the combined investment in these three projects is expected to be in the region of 300 million inclusive of the effect of inflation on construction costs the development of the new plant at longview will provide the group with access to a new fibre basket and drax will also develop port infrastructure at the port of longview adding a fifth port to the groups north american supply chain with the opportunity to consolidate additional capacity in the future the us pacific northwest will be the groups fourth major fibre basket alongside the us south british columbia and alberta the new facility is expected to support further diversification of the groups fibre sourcing production and export capacity supporting sales into asian and european markets as well as ownuse the longview plant will be located next to the port of longview removing the need for rail or road transport of pellets significantly reducing transport time cost and carbon emissions the plant and port are expected to begin commissioning in 2025 the aliceville expansion includes upgrades to existing systems as well as new truck dumps and pelletiser units which will allow for an increase in the amount of sawmill residuals processed the additional capacity is expected to begin commissioning in 2024 generation the groups biomass pumped storage and hydro assets have continued to support uk security of supply providing power system stability at a time of higher gas prices and volatility on the power system drax has continued to optimise biomass generation across all four biomass units roc and cfd maximising generation in the winter based on system need and sustainable biomass supply in october 2022 due to a fall in gas prices and a consequential fall in shortterm power prices drax bought back certain existing forward sold power sales for 2022 on its roc units as a result drax has taken steps to reprofile and optimise biomass supplies between ownuse and thirdparty supply the groups pumped storage and hydro assets have performed strongly in the second half of 2022 providing a wide range of services to the system operator in support of system stability and renewable electricity generation contracted power sales as at 8 december 2022 drax had 283twh of contracted power sales between 2022 and 2024 on its roc and hydro generation assets at an

over the past 12 months the cost of biomass in the european spot market has increased significantly with cargoes trading at over three times their historic average reflecting higher production costs in its own supply chain those of third parties and higher spot market prices drax has incurred additional costs in the second half of 2022 securing biomass to support its reliable and dispatchable generation accordingly the group currently expects its allin contracted cost of biomass for the uk generation business to be over 100mwh in 2023 this is above the historic average in part reflecting increased transportation and fuel costs associated with higher energy costs inflation and the lower value of sterling captured in the groups foreign exchange hedges these factors alongside the electricity generators levy egl see note below could make generation at certain times less economic and is expected to restrict the groups purchase of additional biomass cargoes at spot prices coal in july 2022 at the request of the uk government drax entered into an agreement with national grid to provide a winter contingency service to support the uk power system via its legacy coal units the units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and will only operate if and when instructed to do so by national grid to date national grid has not instructed the units to run other than for testing the contract which covers the period october 2022 to march 2023 provides drax with a fixed fee for the provision of the units with national grid remunerating drax for costs including the coal and carbon associated with any generation draxs decision in 2020 to end coal generation supports the groups purpose of enabling a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and the transition to a flexible renewable generation model this has led to a c99 reduction in the groups scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions since 2012 and enabled drax to become the uks largest source of renewable electricity by output full year expectations reflecting these factors and the strong pumped storage and hydro performance in the second half of 2022 drax now expects that full year adjusted ebitda 1 for 2022 will be slightly above the top of the range of analyst expectations 2  subject to continued good operational performance and logistics for the remainder of the year the power sales reflected in the generation businesss contracted power sales book includes some exchange traded contracts with higher power prices resulting in an increase in collateral payments on these contracts in 2022 inclusive of these temporary cash outflows the group continues to expect net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 to be significantly below 2x at the end of 2022 electricity generators levy in november 2022 the uk government announced a windfall tax on renewable and lowcarbon generators the egl the egl which is expected to be implemented from 1 january 2023 represents a levy on power sales above a threshold and would apply to draxs three biomass units operating under the renewable obligation scheme and its run of river hydro operations but does not include the sale of rocs draxs cfd biomass unit is exempt along with cruachan pumped storage hydro power station and coal generation through november and december drax has engaged with the uk government regarding the precise details of the egl including uk investment allowances and the treatment of costs for dispatchable generators drax notes the uk governments reference to the potential for cost adjustments in its egl technical note published in november 2022 drax anticipates an update from government on these issues shortly bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs  uk drax has continued to commit development expenditure into its drax power station beccs project including continuing a frontend engineering design study the project would see the addition of post combustion carbon capture and storage ccs to two of the existing biomass units using sustainable biomass and adapting a proven technical solution from drax technology partner mitsubishi heavy industries by 2030 the project aims to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 per annum from the atmosphere in doing so drax power station aims to become one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide removals negative co 2  in the world the uk government recognises the important role which beccs has to play in delivering net zero requiring at least 5mt of co 2 removals per annum from beccs and other engineered greenhouse gas removal technologies by 2030 in august 2022 the uk government published a powerbeccs business model consultation which set a viable investment framework based on a cfd mechanism for both power generation and negative emission production in addition the uk government also set out the timeframe for the selection of track 1 powerbeccs projects stating that shortlisted projects could be confirmed from december 2022 with draft heads of terms for the contracts in the first half of 2023 track 1 projects are expected to commission in the mid2020s and along with expected clarity on the financial model this supports draxs aim to take a fid in 2024 and commission a first unit in 2027 with a second by 2030 the sixmonth extension of coal unit availability to march 2023 is not expected to impact the timing of a fid or intended commissioning date for the project site preparation works for beccs are ongoing and will continue following formal closure of the coal units in march 2023 on conclusion of the contract with national grid see above beccs  north america drax aims to realise its ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 primarily through the development of beccs including the development of beccs globally to realise these opportunities the group is progressing a number of work streams including regulation and policy technology fibre sourcing logistics and commercial over the course of the year the group has made good progress towards its ambition to deliver 4mt per annum of cdrs from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 with a primary focus on north america opportunities under consideration include two newbuild 300mw beccs power units each capable of producing 2twh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and each capturing over 2mt of co 2 per annum drax is also developing options for a pellet plant with beccs and the addition of beccs to existing generation assets including coaltobiomasstobeccs key considerations for these opportunities include proximity to sustainable biomass fibre ccs infrastructure regulatory support commercial potential and technology drax is evaluating a range of potential financial models for these projects which could include longterm power purchase agreements ppas longterm cdr offtake agreements and government investment frameworks as part of the development of these models in september 2022 drax announced a memorandum of understanding mou for the worlds biggest carbon removals deal with respira a carbon broker under the terms of the mou respira will be able to purchase up to 2mt of cdrs over a fiveyear period from draxs north american beccs projects regulation and policy development the regulatory environment for beccs in the us has continued to develop in 2022 with the inclusion of beccs as an eligible technology under the department of energy climate goals funding scheme and the increase in 45q support to 85 per tonne of co 2 captured under the inflation reduction act a recent national renewable energy lab report highlights that by 2035 the us could need c100mt of negative emissions from beccs to offset remaining carbon emissions in the power sector in addition recent state level developments in louisiana and california have both been supportive of the development of beccs the louisiana congress approved a bill that classifies biomass as carbon neutral and beccs as carbon negative similarly californias net zero strategy identifies beccs as a critical tool in the delivery of their climate targets the california air resources board which is responsible for climate policy has stated its intention to deploy 75mt of carbon removals including beccs by 2045 potential for significant growth in cdrs research by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the worlds leading authority on climate science states that cdr methods including beccs are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit warming to 15 o c all the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the ipccs latest report use significant volumes of cdrs and specifically beccs as a key tool for mitigating climate change the ipcc believes that globally between 05 and 95 billion tonnes of cdrs via beccs will be required and the unbacked principles for responsible investment estimate that the cdr market could be worth over a trillion dollars by 2050 drax sees significant growth opportunities linked to beccs in north america and in order to progress these opportunities in 2023 expects to invest in development expenditure in the region of 30 million with a view to progressing these opportunities to a fid drax expects to update on progress with these opportunities in the first half of 2023 biomass sustainability delivering positive outcomes for people climate and nature are at the core of draxs business model and ensuring that drax only uses biomass which is sourced sustainably is central to this ambition biomass  when sustainably sourced  supports good forestry is a renewable source of energy and an important part of both uk and international renewable energy policy drax sources its biomass from wellestablished forestry markets in the us and canada as well as europe the main output from these markets is sawlogs which are processed for use in construction and manufacturing such as house building when used in this way these materials represent a source of longterm carbon storage and when the forest regenerates or is replanted these growing trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere drax supports these forest economies by providing incremental secondary revenues to forest landowners through the purchase of material which is not merchantable to a sawmill such as bark branches lowgrade wood and woody material from forest management activities thinning in addition to purchasing sawmill residues from sawmills these materials often have limited alternative uses in some instances where there would otherwise be no demand for these materials they are burned to reduce the risk of wildfire the spread of disease and to allow the forest to be replanted  this is especially prevalent in canada in the us south the periodic thinning of a forest helps improve the size and quality of sawlogs when the trees reach maturity the economic value of the timber produced and the carbon absorbed and stored as well as forest health and biodiversity if forests were not thinned the revenue from sawlogs would be reduced and landowners may consider other uses for their land such as agricultural crops and livestock farming the management of forestland to produce sawlogs ensures forests are growing vigorously absorbing carbon and forests remain a carbon sink forests in the areas where drax sources material are subject to national and regional regulation and typically supported by and independently monitored for compliance by forest certification schemes such as the forestry stewardship council  fsc 3  sustainable forestry initiative sfi and programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc drax supplements this regulation through its own biomass sourcing policy and checks of its supply chain with third party verification
