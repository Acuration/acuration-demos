power station spokesperson statement on drax power station unit 6 testing testing follows the completion of essential maintenance on the coal power generation unit 16 june 2020 essential maintenance has been carried out on one of our coal generating units as is usual during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and the coal units are not required to run following the completion of this work we need to make sure the unit is performing well ready for the winter when demand for power increases and the coal units are expected to run as a result tests are being carried out now which require the unit to generate power ends notes to editors drax has announced it will stop generating power using coal in march 2021  well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline the power stations transformation from coal to converting twothirds of its units to using sustainably sourced biomass wood pellets is europes largest decarbonisation project drax has set a commitment to become carbon
