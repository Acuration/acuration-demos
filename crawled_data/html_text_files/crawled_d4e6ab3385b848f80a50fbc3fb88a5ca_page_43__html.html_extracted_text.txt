Press Release
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, comments on ippr North energy report
22 October 2018
Press releases

“The north is ideally placed to take advantage of the opportunities a lower carbon economy creates for clean growth – playing a vital role in helping the UK and the world to meet its climate targets.
“Over a decade ago, Drax started its journey to phase out coal. We are now by far the biggest renewable power producer in the UK, having converted two-thirds of our generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal.
We have also reskilled our colleagues to use a renewable fuel and play an active role in the low carbon transition.
“We’re exploring new carbon capture technologies which could enable us to further decarbonise and deliver negative carbon emissions – vital if we are to meet the climate challenge set out by the IPCC.
“We plan to complete the phase out of coal well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline but we will still provide flexible, dependable electricity by repowering our remaining two coal units to use natural gas – providing highly efficient, flexible power when it is most needed.
“This will not only help support the power grid as it transitions to a low carbon system, it will also preserve the life of the plant and help protect jobs.”

Drax Group B2B power suppliers set new record for businesses using 100% renewable power
18 October 2018
Press releases

This is a new record number of UK business sites to receive certified 100% renewable power – making Opus Energy and Haven Power collectively the largest suppliers of renewable energy to UK businesses.
Jonathan Kini, CEO of Drax Group’s retail businesses, says power suppliers have a responsibility to encourage and support businesses to be more sustainable and enable the UK to achieve the clean growth needed to meet our climate targets.
A recent Haven Power survey found 59% per cent of businesses think renewable energy is key to a cleaner future, but 80% expect suppliers to take the lead in educating them about their renewable energy options.
Jonathan Kini said:
“Every business is different, but it seems most want to be more sustainable and play a part in reaching our climate targets – they just need us, the suppliers, to help them achieve these aspirations.
“By making renewable electricity the standard, businesses become instantly a lot more sustainable, which allows us to move the conversation with our customers on to talking about other steps they can take, such as reducing their energy consumption, generating their own renewable power or even using batteries.
“Opus Energy has more than 2,200 SMEs which are already generating their own renewable power – so the appetite for more sustainability is definitely there.
“Green GB Week and the tenth anniversary of the Climate Change Act is an ideal time for businesses to celebrate how far we have come in the last decade, and also to look ahead to what we still need to do to achieve our ambitions.”

Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner responds to IPCC and IEA reports on climate change and renewable energy
8 October 2018
Press releases

Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said:
“The IPCC is right to highlight
the scale of the challenge ahead if we are to tackle climate change
. Net zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be required to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees and
Drax is focused on creating a zero carbon, lower cost energy future
.
“Since we converted two thirds of the power station in Yorkshire to use biomass instead of coal, we have transformed the business to become the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe – delivering carbon savings of more than 80% and enough renewable power for around four million homes. At the same time we are supporting sustainable forestry and improving the world’s long-term forest carbon sinks. But we’re not stopping there.
“We are now investing in a
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) pilot project
– the first of its kind in Europe, which is due to get underway this autumn.
“This technology has the potential to make the electricity we generate carbon negative, reducing the CO
2
accumulating in the atmosphere and helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
“Today’s IEA Market Report confirms
bioenergy must play a critical role in delivering a secure and sustainable energy system of the future
– it can support the grid as more renewables come online and has the potential to help other sectors such as transport and heat to decarbonise – vital if we are to meet the challenge set out by the IPCC.”

Leeds MP visits ‘ground-breaking’ carbon capture company
Press releases

During the visit to C-Capture’s premises, Rachel Reeves MP heard how a Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot project is expected to get underway at Drax Power Station this autumn, which will be the first of its kind in Europe.
The chemistry being used in the pilot project has been developed by
C-Capture
– a Leeds University spin-out. During her visit to the company’s facilities, Rachel Reeves, who is MP for Leeds West, got to see some of the equipment which will be installed at Drax Power Station for the pilot.
Rachel Reeves said:
“This BECCS project between C-Capture and Drax is ground-breaking. If it works, it could put Yorkshire and the UK at the forefront of the race to develop the BECCS technology which is essential to tackling climate change. It’s very exciting and I look forward to hearing more as the pilot progresses.”
BECCS is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced. This means power generation would no longer contribute to climate change, but would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere.
Drax, the biggest power station in the UK, near Selby in North Yorkshire, is investing £400,000 in the
BECCS pilot project
with C-Capture. Since it converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal it has become the biggest single site renewable power generator in the country and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“This BECCS pilot has the potential to make the renewable electricity produced at Drax Power Station carbon negative. If we’re serious about meeting our climate targets, then negative emissions are a must – and BECCS is what’s going to get us there.”
Chris Rayner, founder of C-Capture and Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Leeds, added:
“During the six month pilot at Drax, we aim to use our chemistry to capture a tonne of carbon a day and in the process demonstrate that if the project was scaled up we could achieve one of the holy grails of CO
2
emissions strategies – negative emissions in power production. That’s where we believe the potential CO
2
emissions reductions are likely to be the greatest.”
C-Capture
is a spin-out from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Leeds, established through funding from IP Group Plc.

Editor’s Notes
Drax Power Station is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world – 65% of the electricity it produced in 2017 was renewable, enough to power four million households.
Biomass, such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets, is a renewable fuel – the CO
2
captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere. When coupled with CCS, the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more CO
2
from the atmosphere than it releases.
A report by the Energy Technology Institute in 2016 has suggested that by the 2050s BECCS could deliver
roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year
in the UK – approximately half the nation’s emissions target.
The government’s Clean Growth Strategy identified ‘sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with CCUS technology’ as a potential route to achieving long-term decarbonisation between now and 2050.
C-Capture is a spin out from the Chemistry Department at Leeds University and has attracted support from IP Group, the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy’s Energy Entrepreneurs Fund and the CO
2
Capture Project for CO
2
capture technology, which has potential in a range of areas including biogas upgrading, natural gas sweetening and hydrogen production.

Drax puts innovative robot technology to the test
3 October 2018
Press releases

Hundreds of train movements each month at Drax, the UK’s biggest power station, could soon be managed by the robot – reducing the time needed to check-in fuel deliveries by up to six hours each day.
The innovative pilot project at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire will begin this month (October) within its commercial services team to see if the use of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can help manage the booking in of millions of tonnes of fuel delivered to the power station each year.
An average of 20 freight trains a day deliver the biomass and coal needed at Drax so it can produce the power required to keep the lights on for around six million households.
Predominantly a biomass power generator, more than 70% of the electricity produced by Drax is renewable with the majority of rail deliveries bringing wood pellets into the power station to supply its four biomass generating units.
The process of booking in each rail delivery requires the use of eight separate systems and involves 167 individual steps for one staff member to complete the task, which takes them between four and seven hours to complete, depending on the number of deliveries.
The team believes that the use of a purpose-built, digital robot, which will handle the processes automatically, could deliver the same result in just 40 minutes.
People would then be required to intervene when the robot identifies anomalies and further investigation or more detailed work is required.
They believe the time needed for manual intervention would be cut from up to seven hours per day, to just one – giving individuals six hours back each day to focus on other, more rewarding and engaging tasks.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“We’re constantly looking for new ways to improve our operations, to increase efficiency and make staff roles as fulfilling as possible.
“If we can use this robot technology to free up time and allow people to put their skills and expertise to good use, so they’re not getting bogged down in the admin we all love to hate, then I think we’ll see all sorts of benefits, both in terms of efficiencies but also in levels of staff motivation.
“Innovation is at the heart of our business – we were pioneers in transforming the UK’s largest coal-fired power station to become the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe, and are exploring the use of Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage to help us deliver negative emissions and tackle climate change. The use of RPA is another example of how we’re using new technologies to deliver our strategy.”
Beth Clifford, Commercial Services Supervisor, who will be trialling the robot, said:
“Potentially, this could massively reduce the more mundane and tedious parts of my job.
“Having more time to focus on other tasks will hopefully mean I feel like I’m adding more value, will enjoy my job more and can also take on new work which will be more interesting. I can’t wait to see how this goes and my colleagues are the same.”
Vicky Harris, Commercial Service Centre Manager, who is leading the pilot project, said:
“We’ll be measuring how effective the trial is and whether it delivers the savings we expect before a final decision is made about rolling it out.
“But we’re confident this is going to be a really positive development and we will be scoping out other processes at the power station which we think would also benefit from this kind of automation.”
The pilot project using RPA to book-in Drax’s rail deliveries will run for up to a month.
RPA is a form of automation using a software robot that mimics human actions – such as mouse clicks on a computer, but does not engage in any decision-making or the kinds of ‘thought processes’ associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.

Editor’s Notes
Two thirds of Drax Power Station now runs on biomass, producing enough renewable power for around four million households.
It has plans to repower its remaining two coal generating units to develop high efficiency Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) with battery storage.
If successful it could stop using coal as early as 2023, well ahead of the Government’s 2025 deadline for getting coal off the power system.
Drax uses around 7.5 million tonnes of biomass each year, the majority of which comes from north America and Europe.
Its UK biomass supply chain runs from coast to coast – Tyne, Hull, Immingham and Liverpool – with an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day (over a six-day working week).
Each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the UK with enough electricity for a year.
Using rail saves approximately 270,000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 32,622.50 tonnes of C0
2
per year.

Drax staff raise £2,500 for Macmillan
1 October 2018
Press releases

Runners completed either a 5km or 10km route around
Drax’s Skylark Nature Reserve
as part of the company’s Macmillan World’s Biggest Coffee Morning event on Friday (September 28).
Each member of the Drax team donated £1 per kilometre to take part in the event with those completing the 10km route climbing to the top of local landmark Barlow Mound which is next to the power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire.
Staff also contributed to Macmillan’s ‘World’s Biggest Coffee Morning’, by making home-baked cakes and treats to sell in aid of the charity – with staff contributing to cake stalls around the power station site.
The monies raised were then match funded by Drax. In total they raised £2,500 for the charity, which provides support and advice to people with cancer and their families.
Macmillan Area Fundraising Manager for North and East Yorkshire, Clara White, who was on hand to start the race, thanked the runners as they came over the finish line.
She said, “I was delighted to be able to attend the Big Skylark Fun Run – the money raised by Drax Power Station staff is vital to the work we do to help thousands of people affected by cancer and their families across Yorkshire very year.
“Congratulations to all the runners, and thanks also to everyone who baked and bought cakes during the coffee morning. I hope all the runners treated themselves to an extra large slice of cake afterwards – they certainly earned it!”
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner, who participated in the 5k run, said:
“Congratulations to all the staff involved today – it was great to see such a fantastic turn out for a worthy cause. The run has been such a success we hope to make it an annual event.”
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss, who completed the 10k course added:
“The run was a lot of fun – the run up Barlow Mound was a little challenging, but worth it for the views from the top!”
“The work of Macmillan in supporting cancer patients and their families is vital – most of us have been affected by cancer at some point in our lives, so perhaps it’s no surprise that so many of our staff got involved and showed their support. The runners and bakers were brilliant – but the team which organised the event was also fantastic. Well done all.”

Emergency training exercise at Drax Power Station
29 September 2018
Press releases

Emergency services from Yorkshire and Humberside are working with the UK’s largest power station to test their combined capabilities in dealing with complex emergency incidents in the biggest training exercise of its kind at a power station in the region.
A training exercise will be staged at Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, on Saturday September 29 at 11am, when emergency services staff will team up with power station employees to test their skills.
The scenario they will be faced with will include a staged tanker explosion, which for the purposes of the training exercise will cause multiple issues at the industrial site, requiring specialist search and rescue skills to be deployed.
Jez Rushworth, assistant chief fire officer (operations) from North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (pictured), said:
“By providing all of the agencies and Drax staff, with an opportunity to test their collective capabilities in this manner it enables us to build on the high level of expertise we already have in responding to and managing very serious and complex incidents across the county.
“We’ll be practicing skills in tackling different kinds of fires, working within unfamiliar industrial environments, managing and minimising environmental hazards, as well as rescuing casualties with a range of injuries – all of which is vital training so when it comes to saving real lives, we’re as prepared as we can be.”
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“At Drax we have an excellent safety record, but as a responsible business and the operator of the UK’s biggest power station we want to do everything we can to reduce the likelihood of emergency incidents happening, as well as minimising their impact should the worst happen
“Creating this complex scenario in a live industrial setting like Drax Power Station, should make it more realistic for everyone involved, so they get the most out of it. The power station will be in operation as normal throughout the event.
“People living nearby might see some smoke at around 11am on Saturday morning as the exercise gets underway. They may also see some emergency services activity on or near the site throughout the day.”
Staff from the following agencies are taking part in the exercise, alongside around 40 staff from Drax Power Station:
North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service
West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service
Humberside Fire and Rescue Service
North Yorkshire Ambulance Service Hazardous Area Response Team (HART)
North Yorkshire County Council
The Environment Agency
The staged incident will take place at the southern side of the 1,850 acre Drax Power Station site.

Drax Power Station


Delivering social, economic and environmental benefits for the Northern Powerhouse region
26 September 2018
Press releases

THE North is well placed to be the driving force behind new technologies that will power the UK for years to come – and power our economy too.
That’s according to Drax’s Group Director of Corporate Affairs, Clare Harbord, who will give the keynote speech at the West and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce AGM, today (Wednesday September 26) in Leeds.
“As a responsible, sustainable business Drax takes its role in the Northern Powerhouse very seriously. We’re proud of our Yorkshire roots and we’re a growing British company delivering social, economic and environmental benefits across the country.”
Drax contributes more than £500m a year to the Northern economy, employing around 900 people at the power station near Selby, and supporting a further 6,000 jobs in the wider supply chain across the region.
Having been the UK’s biggest coal-fired power station, Drax has transformed itself to become the country’s biggest renewable power generator, and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It has converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass from coal. In the process it has protected jobs and is securing the long term future of the power station.
Clare Harbord explained that there are some major opportunities for the North to be at the heart of innovative new technologies within the energy industry, building on the region’s industrial past and now more recently as a world leader in lower carbon technologies like offshore wind, nuclear and biomass.
“Innovation is a fundamental requirement for the clean growth needed if we are to meet our climate targets – that’s why we’re investing £400,000 in a pioneering bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot with Leeds University spin out C-Capture, which could enable us to make the power we produce carbon negative.
“If we capitalise on the innovation and expertise we have here, then in the process we can deliver environmental, social and economic benefits for our communities too,” she explained.
“Having a highly skilled, diverse and inclusive workforce is vital to all of this. In the North we already have world-class engineers but we need to do more to invest in the next generation so they have the right education and skills, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.
“Businesses have a key role to play and I’m proud to say Drax is working hard to inspire the next generation of engineers through school visits to the power station as well as apprenticeships – we’ve increased our intake of engineering apprentices at the power station by fifty percent this year.
“We’re also supporting academic research within our Northern Powerhouse universities to keep the region at the forefront of developments and maintain our position as world leaders.
“By working together with education providers, academics, businesses, local and regional government and our communities, we can develop opportunities which allow us to reach the great potential we have here in the North.”

Editor’s Notes
Drax announced
it is working with C-Capture, a Leeds University spin-out, on the first bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project of its kind in Europe, earlier this year. The pilot is due to get underway this autumn and is expected to capture a tonne of carbon dioxide each day. Drax is in discussions with the British Beer and Pub Association to see if the CO2 it captures during the trial could be used by
the drinks industry
.
The company
converted its fourth generating unit
from coal to biomass this summer, enabling it to produce more renewable power at the times the grid needs it the most.
Drax is pushing ahead with plans to repower its remaining coal units to gas and develop large-scale battery storage. It’s application for a Development Consent Order has been accepted for examination by the Planning Inspectorate with a decision expected from the Secretary of State for BEIS next year.
The government has said it wants there to be no more coal used to generate power in the UK from October 2025. If Drax’s gas plans are approved, it could stop using coal well ahead of the government’s deadline.
Drax welcomed 13,000 visitors to the power station near Selby, North Yorkshire, in 2017
Its new apprentices began work at the power station
last month
.
Drax is sponsoring
PhDs at Sheffield University, researching a range of areas including the impact of human behaviour on vehicle to grid technologies for electric vehicles.
