sustainable bioenergy humans have used wood as a source of fuel for over a million years  modern biomass power however is a far cry from humans early taming of fire and this is down to constant research and innovation in fact today its one of the most extensively researched areas in energy and environmental studies with biomass accounting for 64 of total renewable energy production in the eu in 2015 the development isnt likely to stop ongoing advancements in the field are helping the technology become more sustainable and efficient in reducing emissions here are seven of the projects businesses ideas and technologies pushing biomass further into the future torrefaction  supercharging biomass pellets when it comes to making biomass as efficient as possible its all down to each individual pellet improving whats known as the calorific value of each pellet increases the overall amount of energy released when they are used in a power station one emerging process aiming to improve this is torrefaction which involves heating biomass to between 250 and 300 degrees celsius in a lowoxygen environment this drives out moisture and volatiles from woody feedstocks straw and other biomass sources before it is turned into a black biocoal pellet which has a very high calorific value this year estonian company baltania is constructing the first industrialscale torrefaction plant in the country with the target output of 160000 tonnes of biocoal pellets per year if its successful power stations worldwide may be able to get more power from each little pellet biobean  powered by caffeine biofuels dont just come from forest residues every day more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed globally as people get themselves caffeinated for the day ahead in london alone this need for daily stimulation results in more than 200000 tonnes of coffee waste produced every year more often than not this ends up in landfills biobean aims to change this by collecting used coffee grounds from cafes offices and factories and recycling them into biofuels and biochemicals the company now recycles as much as 50000 tonnes of coffee grounds annually while one of its products b20 biodiesel has been used to power london buses biobean also produces briquettes and pellets which like woody biomass can serve as an alternative to coal biomass gasification  increasing the value of biomass waste biogas is often seen as a promising biofuel with fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels or biomass pellets its an area undergoing significant research as it points to another means of creating highervalue products from biomass matter the finnish town of vaasa is home to the worlds largest gasification plant  the facility is part of a coal plant where cofiring biogas with coal has allowed it to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by as much as 230000 tonnes per year as well as reducing emissions cofiring allows the power plant to use 25 to 40 less coal and when demand is low in the autumn and spring months the plant runs entirely on biogas more than that the forestry residues which are used to produce the biogas are sourced locally from within 100 km of site as part of our transition away from coal cofiring biomass with that fossil fuel took place at drax power station from 2003 until full unit conversions became a reality in 2013 lynemouth power station  powering the move away from coal after 44years the coalfired lynemouth power station in northumberland is the latest uk power producer converting to biomassfuel set for completion this year the plant will supply 390 mw of lowcarbon electricity to the national grid enough to power 700000 homes  every new power station conversion poses different challenges as well as the opportunity to develop new solutions but none are as crucial as the conversion of the materials handling equipment from coal to biomass pellets while coal can sit in the rain for long periods of time and still be used biomass must be kept dry with storage conditions constantly monitored and adjusted to prevent sudden combustion at lynemouth the handling of 14 million tonnes of biomass annually has required the construction of three 40metre high concrete storage silos as well as extensive conveyor systems to unload and transport biomass around the plant biotrans  two birds with one stone energy and food are both undergoing serious changes to make them more sustainable danish startup biotrans is tackling both challenges by using one of the food industrys key pain points  wastage  to create energy with its biogas systems the company installs systems that collect leftover food from restaurants and canteens and stores it in odourproof tanks before collecting and turning it into biogas for heating and electricity production more than just utilising this waste stream the byproduct of the gasification process can also be sold as a fertiliser drax and ccapture  cutting emissions from the source carbon capture usage and storage ccus is one of the most important fields in the energy sector today the technologys ability to capture co 2 from the electricity generation process and turn it into a revenue source before it can enter the atmosphere means its attracting significant investment and research drax is partnering with ccapture  a company spun out of the university of leeds chemistry department to trial a new form of ccus the pilot scheme will launch in november and aims to capture a tonne of co 2 per day from one of draxs biomass units ccaptures technology could make the process of capturing and storing co 2 less costly and energy intensive it does this using a specially developed solvent capable of isolating co 2 before being recycled through the system and capturing more if the pilot proves successful the technology could be implemented at an industrial scale seeing up to 40 of the co 2 in the flue gases from draxs biomass units captured and stored if the technology tested at drax leads to the construction of a purposebuilt carbon capture unit elsewhere scientists and engineers at ccapture believe the co 2 captured could exceed 90 back in north yorkshire the eventual goal is negative carbon emissions from drax power station  its biomass units already deliver carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when they used coal and if a new revenue stream can be developed from the sale of the carbon captured then the power produced from biomass at the power station could become even more cost effective with thanks to biomass uk and the european biomass
