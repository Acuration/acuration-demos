construction project which involved a workforce peaking at around 8000 in 2003 drax power station started cofiring biomass as a renewable energy alternative to coal doosan babcock has supported drax with research and development of biomass firing equipment through to the full project delivery of key technologies in this conversion process draxs biomass conversion project was one of the largest power plant modernisation programmes in uk history drax committed to transforming the business into a mainly biomassfuelled generator using compressed wood pellets in place of coal during the summer this year a fourth generating unit was converted from coal to use biomass  enabling drax to generate more renewable power at the times the grid needs it the most around 70 of the power produced by drax is now renewable enough for four million households drax power also plans to repower the remaining two coal units to use high efficiency gas turbine technology and build up to 200mw of battery storage on site to provide additional flexibility if these plans are approved drax could stop using coal as soon as 2023  well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline for unabated coal to no longer be
