was signed uk climate action can help the rest of the world meet its net zero commitments says drax ceo will gardiner will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 11 december 2020 opinion december 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the paris agreement it represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat climate change and build a better future  however global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treatys target of keeping global warming below 152 degrees celsius explore carbon capture by drax countries have set their own decarbonisation targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative  as we at drax intend to achieve by 2030  while these leading ambitions are important for the uk and the world to meet the goals of the paris agreement real action polices and investment are needed at scale we have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago we know from the recent 6 th carbon budget that renewable energy as well as carbon capture usage and storage ccus are essential for the uk to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in that detailed 1000page report  the climate change committee ccc was clear that progress must be made immediately  the country as a whole must be 78 of the way there by 2035 by investing where its needed the uk can lead the world in a whole new industry one that may come to define the next century  leading the world in decarbonisation it was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the uk to launch the industrial revolution some 250 years ago today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world as a country  one that i moved to over 20 years ago now  we have decarbonised at a greater pace than any other over the past decade investing in renewable generation such as wind solar and biomass has allowed the uk to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for net zero emissions  to remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future power grids will require vastly increased support from energy storage systems such as pumped hydro  as well as flexible reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation however the urgency of climate change means the uk must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing negative emissions technologies which remove more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit the ccc as well as national grids future energy scenarios report have emphasised the necessity of negative emissions for the uk to reach net zero  by removing co 2 not just from energy but other industries too the uk can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cuttingedge green technology that can take the country to net zero establishing it as a world leader for others to follow creating an industry exporting it to the world when the paris agreement was signed i was just joining drax i had been impressed by the power stations transformation from coal to biomass  europes largest decarbonisation project  supporting thousands of jobs in the process five years on and im excited for the next stage delivering negative emissions by deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs we can permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere while producing renewable electricity drax has successfully piloted beccs and is ready to deploy it at scale as part of our zero carbon humber partnership click graphic to view find out more about bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and negative emissions  im confident the partnership with other leading energy industrial and academic organisations can act as a revitalising force in a region that has historically been underinvested in  protect 55000 jobs and create 50000 new opportunities developing the supply chain surrounding a worldleading zerocarbon cluster in the humber could deliver a 32 billion economic boost to the wider economy as we emerge from the covid19 pandemic i believe we can establish a new industry to export globally the humbers ports have a long history of trade and we can build on this legacy the machinery equipment and services needed to develop beccs and zero carbon humber will be an essential export as the rest of the world races to decarbonise unloading sustainable biomass wood pellets destined for drax power station from a vessel at the port of immingham by providing training and partnering with educational institutions we can increase scientific and technical skills net zero industrial clusters can enable more in society the opportunity to have rewarding and fulfilling engineering energy and environmental careers this model can reach around the world  positioning people and businesses to help countries to reach the collective goals of paris agreements the economic benefits for such achievements far outweigh the costs of failing to stem global warming and we are ready to invest in the technologies needed to do so with robust government policies in place a net zero future could cost as little as 1 of gdp over the next 30 years  countering climate change is a onceinalifetime challenge for the world but also a onceinalifetime opportunity to build a sustainable future with sustainable jobs improved standards of living health and wellbeing the uk has a responsibility to use its expertise and resources setting in place the structures that can allow companies like mine  drax  to lead the world to reaching the paris agreements targets and beyond find
