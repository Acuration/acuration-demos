september 2020 sustainable bioenergy think of carbon emissions and the image that comes to mind is often of industrial sites or power generation  not of what we eat and what we throw away but food waste is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions globally food loss and waste from across the food chain generates the equivalent of 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  a year  or about 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions but what if there was a way to reduce those emissions and generate power by using discarded food and other organic waste like grass cuttings or nut shells a technology known as anaerobic digestion is increasingly making this idea a reality how anaerobic digestion works all organic waste products have energy in them but its tied up in the form of calories when food and vegetation rots microorganisms break down those calories into gases and other products methane or ammonium molecules exactly what these other products are depends on whether there is any oxygen present with oxygen the products are water co 2 and ammonia but remove oxygen from the equation and a very valuable gas is produced methane ch 4  the lack of oxygen is also what gives anaerobic digestion its name  when oxygen is present it becomes aerobic digestion during the anaerobic digestion process bacteria and other microorganisms break down organic matter gradually deteriorating complex polymers like glucose or starch into progressively simpler elements such as alcohol ammonia co 2 and ultimately ch 4  a biogas with huge potential as a fuel for other processes anaerobic power in practice the ch 4 produced in anaerobic digestion is incredibly useful as a fuel  turn on a gas hob or stovetop and its predominantly methane that provides the fuel for the flame the chemical compound is also the main component in the natural gas that makes up much of great britains electricity supply this means using anaerobic digestion to create ch 4 out of waste products turns that waste into a valuable power source but its not as simple as putting a bag over a rubbish tip and hoping for the best instead anaerobic digestion is carried out in large tanks called digesters these are filled with feedstocks from biological substances that can include anything from food scraps to alcohol and distillery waste to manure under the right conditions microorganisms and bacteria begin to digest and breakdown these substances into their basic elements the air quantity and temperature of the digesters is carefully regulated to ensure the microorganisms have the best possible environment to carry out the digestion of the feedstock with different types of feedstock and microorganisms operating best in different conditions the biogas created as a result of this digestion is then captured ready to be turned into something useful making use of biogas three different things can happen to the biogas produced during the course of the digestion locally it can be combusted onsite to provide further heat to regulate the temperature of the anaerobic digestion units or it can be combusted in a combined heat and power chp generator where it can generate electricity to be used on site  for example to power a farm  or sold through energy suppliers such as opus energy onto wider regional or national electricity networks this biogas electricity is an important element of great britains energy supply accounting for 6600 gwh or 73 of all power generated by solid and gaseous fuels in 2017 some of the biogas can even be cleaned to remove co 2  leaving behind pure methane that can be pumped onto natural gas grids and used to provide heat and power to households government research estimates a fully utilised biogas sector could provide up to 30 of the uks household gas demands  after the digestion process has been completed and the biogas has been removed what is left behind in the digester is a mass of solid matter called digestate this is extremely rich in nutrients and mineral such as potassium and nitrogen making it an excellent soil enhancer where anaerobic digestion is being used today today much of anaerobic digestion power is generated on farms  unsurprisingly given the ready access to biological waste material to use as feedstock as well as a potential source of electricity and heat it also gives farmers access to a new revenue stream by selling electricity or biogas as well as reducing utility and fertiliser costs while many of these installations are smaller scale some can get quite big linstock castle farm in north cumbria for example has a biogas facility with a 11 megawattmw operating capacity enough to power as many as 2000 homes at a time it was originally installed by the farmers as a more costeffective way of growing their business than buying more dairy cows there is however potential for anaerobic digestion to operate on an even larger scale in the us the city of philadelphia is developing a system that will link all newly built households together into a network where food waste is automatically collected and transported to a biogas generating facility closer to home northumbrian water uses 100 of its sludge the waste produced from purifying water to produce renewable power via anaerobic digestion  its estimated to have reduced the carbon footprint of the facilitys operations by around 20 and saved millions of pounds in savings on operating costs there have also been experiments with using biogas to power vehicles the biobus was the first bus in the uk to be powered by biomethane made from food sewage and commercial liquid waste and ran between bath and bristol airport but anaerobic digestion power is not a magic bullet it will be right in certain situations but not all if utilised effectively anaerobic digestion and biogas could fill a vital role in national electricity and gas networks while at the same time helping dispose of waste products in an environmentallyfriendly and costeffective way tags gas  biomass energy  customers  electricity generation  opus energy  renewable energy could hydrogen power stations offer flexible electricity for a net zero future 26 august 2020 power generation were familiar with using natural gas every day in heating homes powering boilers and igniting stove tops but this same natural gas  predominantly methane  is also one of the most important sources of electricity to the uk in 2019 gas generation accounted for 39 of great britains electricity mix  but that could soon be changing hydrogen the super simple super light element can be a zerocarbon emissions source of fuel while were used to seeing it in everyday in water h 2 o as a gas it has been tested as an alternative to methane in homes and as a fuel for vehicles  could it also replace natural gas in power stations and help keep the lights on the need for a new gas hydrogen fuel station natural gas has been the largest single source of electricity in great britain since around 2000 aside from the period 2012 14 when coal made a resurgence due to high gas prices the dominance of gas over coal is in part thanks to the abundant supply of it in the north sea along with carbon pricing  domestic supply makes gas much cheaper than coal and much cleaner emitting as much as 60 less co 2 than the solid fossil fuel added to this is the ability of gas power stations to start up change their output and shut down very quickly to meet sudden shifts in electricity demand this flexibility is helpful to support the growth of weatherdependant renewable sources of power such as wind or solar the stability gas brings has helped the country decarbonise its power supply rapidly hydrogen on the other hand can be an even cleaner fuel as it only releases water vapour and nitrous oxide when combusted in large gas turbines this means it could offer a low or zerocarbon flexible alternative to natural gas that makes use of great britains existing gas infrastructure but its not as simple as just switching fuels switching gases some thermal power stations work by combusting a fuel such as biomass or coal in a boiler to generate intense heat that turns water into highpressure steam which then spins a turbine gas turbines however are different engineer works on a turbine at drax power station instead of heating water into steam a simple gas turbine blasts a mix of gas plus air from the surrounding atmosphere at high pressure into a combustion chamber where a chemical reaction takes place  oxygen from the air continuously feeding a gaspowered flame the highpressure and hot gasses then spin a turbine the reaction that takes place inside the combustion chamber is dependent on the chemical mix that enters it natural gas turbines have been tailored and optimised for their working conditions explains richard armstrong drax lead engineer hydrogen is a gas that burns in the same way as natural gas but it burns at different temperatures at different speeds and it requires different ratios of oxygen to get the most efficient combustion switching a power station from natural gas to hydrogen would take significant testing and refining to optimise every aspect of the process and ensure everything is safe this would no doubt continue over years subtly developing the engines over time to improve efficiency in a similar way to how natural gas combustion has evolved but its certainly possible what may be trickier though is providing the supply of hydrogen necessary to power and balance the countrys electricity system  making hydrogen hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but its very rare to find it on its own because its so atomically simple its highly reactive and almost always found naturally bonded to other elements water is the prime example its made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom making it h 2 o hydrogens tendency to bond with everything means a pure stream of it as would be needed in a power station has to be produced rather than extracted from underground like natural gas hydrogen as a gas at standard temperature and pressure is known by the symbol h 2  a power station would also need a lot more hydrogen than natural gas by volume it would take three times as much hydrogen to produce the same amount of energy as would be needed with natural gas however because it is so light the hydrogen would still have a lower mass a very large supply of hydrogen would be needed which doesnt exist in the uk at the moment says rachel grima research  innovation engineer at drax so at the same time as converting a power plant to hydrogen youd need to build a facility to produce it alongside it one of the most established ways to produce hydrogen is through a process known as steam methane reforming this applies high temperatures and pressure to natural gas to break down the methane which makes up the majority of natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide co 2  the obvious problem with the process is it still emits co 2  meaning carbon capture and storage ccs systems are needed if it is to be carbon neutral source zero carbon humber its almost like capturing the co 2 from natural gas before its combusted rather than postcombustion explains grima one of the advantages of this is that the co 2 is at a much higher concentration which makes it much easier to capture than in flue gas when it is diluted with a lot of nitrogen using natural gas in the process produces whats known as grey hydrogen adding carbon capture to make the process carbon neutral is known as blue hydrogen  but there are ways to make it with renewable energy sources too electrolysis is already an established technology where an electrical current is used to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen this green hydrogen cuts out the co 2 emissions that come from using natural gas however like charging an electric vehicle the process is only carbonneutral if the electricity powering it comes from zero carbon sources such as nuclear wind and solar its also possible to produce hydrogen from biomass by putting biomass under high temperatures and adding a limited amount of oxygen to prevent the biomass combusting the biomass can be gasified meaning it is turned into a mix of hydrogen and co 2  by using a sustainable biomass supply chain where forests absorb the equivalent of the co 2 emitted but where some fossil fuels are used within the supply chain the process becomes low carbon carbon capture use and storage ccus incubation area drax power station ccs can then be added to make it carbon negative overall meaning more co 2 is captured and stored at forest level and in belowground carbon storage than is emitted throughout its lifecycle this form of green hydrogen is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen or negative emissions hydrogen there are plenty of options for making hydrogen but doing it at the scale needed for power generation and ensuring its an affordable fuel is the real challenge then there is the issue of transporting and working with hydrogen the difficulty is less in converting the uks gas power stations and turbines themselves thats a hurdle but most turbine manufacturers already in the process of developing solutions for this says armstrong the challenge is establishing a stable and consistent supply of hydrogen and the transmission network to get it to site working with the lightest known element today hydrogen is mainly transported by truck as either a gas or cooled down to minus253 degrees celsius at which point it becomes a liquid lh 2  however there is plenty of infrastructure already in place around the uk that could make transporting hydrogen significantly more efficient the uk has a very advanced and comprehensive gas grid a conversion to hydrogen would be more economic if you could repurpose the existing gas infrastructure says hannah steedman innovation engineer at drax the most feasible way to feed a power station is through pipelines and a lot of work is underway to determine if the current natural gas network could be used for hydrogen hydrogen is different to natural gas in that it is a very small and highly reactive molecule therefore it needs to be treated differently for example parts of the existing gas network are made of steel a metal which hydrogen reacts with causing whats known as hydrogen embrittlement which can lead to cracks and failures that could potentially allow gas to escape there are also factors around safety and efficiency to consider like natural gas hydrogen is also odourless meaning it would need to have an odourant added to it experimentation is underway to find out if mercaptan the odourant added to natural gas to give it a sulphuric smell is also compatible with hydrogen but for all the challenges that might come with switching to hydrogen there are huge advantages the uks gas network  both power generation and domestic  must move away from fossil fuels if it is to stop emitting co 2 into the atmosphere and for the country to reach net zero by 2050 while the process will not be as simple as switching gases it creates an opportunity to upgrade the uks gas infrastructure  for power in homes and even as a vehicle fuel  source zero carbon humber it wont happen overnight but hydrogen is a proven energy fuel source while it may take time to ramp up production to a scale which can meet demand at a reasonable cost transitioning to hydrogen is a chance to futureproof the gas systems that contributes so heavily to the uks stable

executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags gas  biomass energy  sustainability  energy policy  careers  about us  investors  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation britains power system has never been closer to being fossilfree iain staffell imperial college london 23 july 2019 opinion electricity generation is decarbonising faster in britain than anywhere else in the world 1 changes to the way we produce power over the last six years have reduced carbon emissions by 100 million tonnes per year 2 the carbon savings made in britains power sector are equivalent to having taken every single car and van off our roads 3 this puts britain at the forefront of the wider trend towards clean electricity coal generation is collapsing in germany  having fallen 20 in the last year due to rising carbon prices renewables have beaten fossil fuels as the largest source of generation in europe  a third of americas coal power stations have retired over the last decade as they switch to cleaner natural gas britains coal power stations made international headlines in may for sitting completely idle for two full weeks but coal is only part of the story the second quarter of 2019 saw three major milestones that signal britains progress towards a clean power system the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh across a whole day for the first time renewables hit an alltime high supplying more than half of britains electricity over a full day and for the first time ever less than a tenth of electricity was produced from fossil fuels going below 100 grams 100 grams of co 2 per kwh is an important number two years ago the committee on climate change recommended it as the target for 2030 that would mean our electricity system is in line with the national commitment to decarbonise britains electricity has dipped below 100 grams for single hours at a time but until now it had never done so for a full day june 30 th was a sunny sunday with a good breeze that brought a 33c heatwave to an end electricity demand was among the lowest seen all year while wind output was at a threemonth high the carbon intensity of electricity sat below 100 gkwh for half of the day falling to a minimum of just 73 gkwh in the midafternoon carbon emissions averaged over the day were 97 gkwh beating the previous record of 104 gkwh set a year ago fig 1  britains generation mix during june 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kwh click to viewdownload going above 50 renewables june 30 th was a recordbreaker in a second way wind solar biomass and hydro supplied 55 of electricity demand over the day  smashing the previous daily record of 49 set last summer for the first day in the national grids history more electricity came from renewables than any other source that day britains wind farms produced twice as much electricity as all fossil fuels combined a quarter of the countrys electricity demand was met by onshore wind farms and 15 from offshore 4 despite several reactors being offline for maintenance nuclear power provided nearly a fifth of electricity again more than was supplied by all fossil fuels heading towards fossilfree electricity the rise of renewable energy has been a major factor in decarbonising britains electricity complemented by the incredible fall in coal generation every single coal plant in britain has sat idle for at least two days a week since the start of spring it has been three years since britains first zerocoal hour a year later came the first full day and earlier this year we saw the longest coalfree run in history  lasting 18 days this summer could see the first full month of no coal output if this trend continues fig 2  number of hours per week with zero generation from britains coal power stations click to viewdownload attention must now shift from zero coal to fossil free unabated natural gas without carbon capture and storage needs to be removed from the grid mix by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis and ensure the uk hits netzero emissions across the whole economy at the start of this decade britains power system had never operated with less than half of electricity coming from fossil fuels as renewables were rolled out across the country the share of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically by 2014 the grid was able to operate with less than onethird from fossil fuels and by 2016 it had gone below onefifth on may 26 th  the share of fossil fuels in britains electricity fell below 10 for the first time ever fig 3  the record minimum share of fossil fuels in britains electricity mix over the last decade with projections of the current trend to 2025 click to viewdownload this record could have gone further though during the afternoon 600 mw of wind power was shed  enough to power half a million homes national grid had to turn off a tenth of scotlands wind farms to keep the system stable and secure this wind power had to be replaced by gas biomass and hydro plants elsewhere in the country as these were located closer to demand centres and could be fully controlled at short notice this turndown coincides with ten straight hours where power prices were zero or negative going down to a minimum of 71mwh in the afternoon national grids bill for balancing the system that day alone came to 66m if the power system could have coped with all the renewable energy being generated fossil fuels would have been pushed down to just 8 of the generation mix this highlights the challenges that national grid face in their ambition to run a zero carbon power system by 2025  and the tangible benefits that could already be realised today if the trend of the last decade continues britain could be on course for its first fossilfree hour as early as 2023 this will only be possible if the technical issues around voltage and inertia at times of high wind output can be tackled with new lowcarbon technologies other countries are grappling with questions about whether renewables can be relied on to replace coal and gas britain is proof that renewables can achieve things that werent imaginable just a decade ago zero carbon electricity is  the job that cant wait  britain only has a few more years to wait before the first fossilfree hours become a reality 1 over the last decade the carbon intensity of electricity generation in britain has fallen faster than in any other major economy source energy revolution global outlook  2 in the 12 months to july 2019 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation totalled 605 million tonnes in the 12 months to july 2013 these emissions were 1602 million tonnes both figures include emissions from imported electricity and from producing and transporting biomass see electric insights and our peerreviewed methodology paper for
