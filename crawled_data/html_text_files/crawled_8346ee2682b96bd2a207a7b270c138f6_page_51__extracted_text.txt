drax starts planning process for battery storage and gas options on site 13 september 2017 uncategorized drax today gave notice to the planning inspectorate of its intention to consult on longterm options to repower up to two coal units to gas and build battery storage at drax power station plans for gas on site were announced in june and are part of an ongoing research and development project the options could create up to 36gw of new gas generation capacity and 200mw of battery storage they are subject to a positive investment decision and would need to be underpinned by a 15year capacity market contract the upgrade would enhance drax power stations flexible and responsive capability and make yorkshire the home of large scale battery technology at this early stage in the planning process these figures represent the maximum parameters of the project these options would if developed increase draxs ability to provide the flexible generation and grid support services britains electricity system will need as coal and other large power stations are turned off todays notice to the planning inspectorate is a step in developing these options as part of draxs strategy to play a vital role in changing the way energy is generated as the uk moves to a low carbon future the options complement draxs ongoing work to explore converting a fourth unit to sustainable biomass three units have already been successfully upgraded ontime and onbudget they account for 70 of the electricity drax produces  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool and 16 of the uks total renewable power drax expects to begin consulting on these options with local communities and national stakeholders over the coming weeks andy koss ceo of drax power said we are at the start of the planning process but if developed these options for gas and battery storage show how drax could upgrade our existing infrastructure to provide capacity stability and essential grid services as we do with biomass this would continue to keep costs low for consumers and help to deliver governments commitment to remove coal from the uk grid drax power station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the north of england these options could repurpose up to two of our coal assets and extend their operation into the 2030s we have always supported and worked with our

coal on the power system  the electricity we use is getting cleaner making electric cars and suvs better than ever for lowering our carbon emissions the latest electric insights report produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax analysed electricity generation data from april to june this year it showed that the power produced during this quarter contained 199g of co 2 per kwh  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year dr iain staffell from imperial college london explained it is widely accepted that electric cars dramatically reduce air pollution in cities but there is still some debate about how clean they actually are  it varies depending on where the electricity to charge them with comes from according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models  they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are much better for example producing the electricity to charge a tesla model s back in 2012 would have created 124g of carbon per km driven nowadays emissions from charging the same car have halved to 74g per km driven in winter and just 41g per km in summer  thanks to the decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk smaller electric cars like the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can be charged for less than half the co 2 of the cleanest nonelectric car on the market  the toyota prius hybrid in the uk there are now more than 100000 electric vehicles on the roads  pure electric and plugin hybrid numbers have grown 30fold in four years representing 18 of new car registrations the following table shows the change in carbon intensity of electricity for some of the most popular models of electric vehicle make and

rover evoque emits 125gkm and a toyota prius emits 70gkm based on data from the governments vehicle certification agency at the same time as electric car numbers are increasing britains electricity has been decarbonising andy koss drax power ceo said its very exciting to see from this analysis by dr staffell and the team at imperial how we at drax are contributing to helping the uk to decarbonise our biomass generating units deliver carbon savings of 68 compared to gas power stations and more than 80 compared to when they used coal biomass is cost effective reliable and flexible  this is important not just in terms of reducing emissions in the energy sector but also the far reaching impacts this can have in transforming other sectors like the automotive and rail industries the need for more flexible renewable power generation is a real example of the challenges dieter helms review for beis must address since upgrading half of the power station at drax to sustainable biomass more than two thirds of the power produced is renewable in the first half of this year drax produced 17 of the uks renewable electricity  enough for four million households electric insights is published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  wwwelectricinsightscouk  which provides live data from 2009 until the present the data sources and methodology used in electric insights are listed in full on the website commissioned by drax group owner and operator of the uks largest power station and europes biggest biomassfuelled power plant the report is delivered

lewis drax group head of media relations e email protected t 01757 612165 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 01757 612848 editors notes the calculation to determine the carbon emissions from electric vehicles relies on a number of variables including the time of day or night a vehicle is charged and which power stations increase their output to meet additional demand electric insights has illustrated how these emissions have changed recently by assuming that vehicle charging is spread evenly across the day and uses the average electricity mix during each period the average electricity consumption was averaged across five variants of tesla model s which achieve over a 300 mile driving range  75d  90d  100d  p90d  p100d  these average 322 miles per kwh this was converted to 0194 kwh per km driven the data was taken from the vehicle certification agency direct co 2 emissions are listed as 0 gkm emissions from electricity production were taken from electric insights averaging all halfhourly periods in march 2012 the carbon intensity of production was 569gkwh we assume 75 of electricity is lost in transmission and distribution and 4 in charging the electric vehicle the carbon intensity of electricity consumed was 641gkwh 641 x 0194  1244gkm co 2  fuel economy listed for a 2016 model year toyota prius active 8 with 15 wheels ecvt 941 mpg 70 gkm co 2  other model variants have different fuel economy and carbon emissions the disclaimer from the vehicle certification agency applies to the data used the carbon intensity data for the mitsubishi is for when that suv is driven in electriconly mode not when driven in hybrid mode this edition of electric insights also found reduced carbon intensity is the new norm for britains power system it averaged 199gkwh  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year this is down from 740gkwh in the 1980s and 500gkwh in the 2000s there are seasonal variations in the carbon intensity of the uks electricity generation  more power generation is required to meet higher demand in the darker colder winter months than the summer when there is more power available from low carbon weatherdependent renewables like solar in the second quarter of this year weatherdependent renewables like solar and wind continued to grow with solar breaking a number of records during the period including supplying 25 of demand on april 8 and producing 891gw on may 26 over the quarter solar produced 4twh of electricity  12 above the previous maximum set in 2015 there is a move towards a decentralised power system as 10 of junes electricity did not use the national grid small renewables particularly solar make up a growing portion of the supply and are embedded into local distribution networks rather than connected to highvoltage transmission system the rise of solar has given rise to the proportion of generation which is bypassing the grid reaching its highest ever level in june  more than 25 of demand was met by embedded generation for 41 hours over the quarter primarily on sunny weekend afternoons having more intermittent renewables on the system is also having an impact on prices prices spike when wind and solar output drops and other generators are needed to plug those gaps the analysis by the team at imperial college london found that balancing market prices leapt from around 40 per mwh up to as high as 1500 on may 17 when solar and wind output fell sharply about electric insights electric insights quarterly was commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by national grid and elexon which run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year it will focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the

forest2market report showing increasing demand for wood fibre leads to forest growth 28 july 2017 uncategorized dorothy thompson  drax group ceo said the findings from this independent report are significant the research focuses on the us south where we source the majority of the compressed wood pellets we use to produce 16 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power four million homes it demonstrates quite clearly that the forests in this region are growing  not declining and forest2markets analysis also shows that having a healthy market for forest products incentivises landowners to grow more trees which in turn increases productivity and the carbon storage in these forests our operations are therefore contributing not only to reducing emissions but also in ensuring these

uncategorized an idea to generate renewable electricity for use in a york school while also establishing zero carbon transport between its two sites has won first place in a regional competition sponsored by drax power with a total prize fund of 10000 the project reinvent challenge invited pupils across yorkshire aged 1119 to use their learning and knowledge in stem subjects science technology engineering and maths to develop a workable idea to help improve life in their community a team of five year 7 pupils from all saints school in york impressed judges with their entry dynamo which plans to create a free cycle hub providing 40 bikes for teachers pupils and visitors to travel the half mile between the schools two campuses each bike will be fitted with a bottle dynamo which allows energy generated from cycling to be stored the dynamos are then hooked up to transfer the stored energy to batteries which will be connected into the schools electricity distribution network drax awarded the winning idea 6000 to help it get started with the remaining prize fund being split between the runners up all saints teacher sarah bilton said this is a fantastic achievement were very proud of our pupils and the hard work thought and determination they have shown she added this challenge really got pupils thinking and was a great opportunity to help their understanding of enterprise and investigate ecofriendly ways to benefit the community lots of people drive between the sites or of course have to walk this will simplify and speed up getting from one side of the school to the other and in a way thats better for the environment it will be useful to the whole school community i cant think why someone hadnt thought of this before drax visitor centre manager and member of the judging panel rachael baldwin said all four finalists presented well thought out creative ideas but the dynamo team really impressed us with the technical thinking behind their project as well as coming up with an idea that would benefit their school and local community the team was presented with a trophy by andy koss drax power ceo he said its been tremendously rewarding to see young people harness their imagination and stem learning to find new ways to support their local communities the diverse range of ideas we have seen and presented by the competition finalists shows there is plenty of innovation within schools and colleges across yorkshire we hope this will inspire these students to pursue careers using stem subjects the runnersup were barlby high school near selby with their idea for a learning garden based around science nidderdale high school in pateley bridge with designs for 3 peaks a new climbing wall and scarborough university technical college with
