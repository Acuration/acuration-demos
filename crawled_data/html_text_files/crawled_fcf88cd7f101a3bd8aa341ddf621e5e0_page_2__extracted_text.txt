highlights targeting biomass selfsupply capacity of five million tonnes by 2027 15 million tonnes of existing capacity plus 035 million tonnes of lowcost capacity announced at the 2019 half year results evaluating options for a further three million tonnes over the next seven years supports target to reduce biomass cost by c30 percent to c50mwh targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital trading update  inline with expectations acquired assets performing strongly capacity market restored and included in 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 will gardiner drax group ceo said draxs purpose is to enable a zerocarbon lower cost energy future we believe sustainable biomass has a longterm critical role to play thats why we plan to supply 80 percent of our biomass from our own sources  a significant increase on the 20 percent we currently selfsupply supplying more of our own biomass will cut costs and reduce supply chain risks ensuring our biomass power generation remains viable in the long term when combined with carbon capture it will also enable negative emissions helping the uk on its path to net zero by 2050 will gardiner ceo drax group click to viewdownload in high res capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and his management team will update on how the group is delivering on its purpose the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees in growing its biomass supply and renewable generation businesses investment in biomass to increase capacity and reduce cost as a part of the groups key strategic objective of building a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce its cost of biomass to a level which is economic without subsidy in 2027 these savings will be delivered through further optimisation of existing biomass operations and greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other renewable fuels and a significant expansion of selfsupply capacity drax is targeting five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity by 2027 15 million today plus 035 million tonnes in development with greater scope for operational leverage and cost reduction drax will continue to work with its current suppliers to develop its portfolio at the 2019 half year results drax announced an investment in lowcost capacity at its existing three sites in the us gulf adding 350k tonnes of new capacity by 2021 the capital cost is in the region of 50 million enabling targeted fuel cost savings in excess of 15mwh on the additional capacity once commissioned drax is evaluating options to deliver an additional three million tonnes of capacity these options are expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital with strong cash flow generation and a fast payback these activities would enable drax to develop an unsubsidised biomass generation business by 2027 with the option to service wood pellet demand in other markets  europe north america and asia biomass sustainability is at the heart of the groups activities and drax has implemented industry leading processes which support this expansion encourage forest growth and make a positive contribution to climate change drax lasalle bioenergy wood pellet plant in louisiana is now colocated with a sawmill a new rail spur became operational at lasalle earlier in 2019 click to viewdownload options for gas generation drax continues to see flexible gas generation as an enabler of greater renewable and low carbon generation in addition to supporting the development of hydrogen any investment decision would reflect draxs objective of delivering earnings visibility and be underpinned by a 15year capacity agreement to support a low doubledigit rate of return drax would consider a range of funding options including partnerships consistent with draxs balance sheet objective of around 2 x net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 over time capital allocation and dividend drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 trading and operational performance the performance of the assets acquired from iberdrola in december 2018 has been strong particularly the pumped storage business which has performed well driven by the system support market drax reiterates the adjusted ebitda 1 guidance provided at the time of acquisition of 90110 million in the 2019 financial year in july drax completed the refinancing of the acquisition bridge facility used to acquire these assets these facilities now extend the groups debt maturity profile to 2029 adding an esg 2 facility with a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on draxs carbon emissions against an annual benchmark the groups cost of debt is now below four percent and below three percent on the new facilities reflecting the groups reduced business risk the group continues to identify opportunities to optimise its balance sheet and cash flow during the summer drax completed major planned outages on two biomass units following a delayed return to service the plan is to run all four roc 3 units at high utilisation levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 the outlook for coal generation remains challenging and drax continues to monitor the situation with regards to future operation noting that all unabated uk coal generation must close by 2025 following formal confirmation from the uk government drax expects the capacity market to be reinstated shortly with full retrospective payments made for the capacity provided capacity payments due to drax for 2019 and since the suspension of the capacity market in 2018 are 75 million drax expects these to be included in 2019 adjusted ebitda 1  with cash settlement in january 2020 these factors underpin the groups expectations for full year adjusted ebitda 1  which remain unchanged and around 2 x net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 when adjusted to

political donations 15 october 2019 investors in the lead up to the 2019 agm the company undertook initial consultation with major shareholders and received a variety of feedback on both the resolution and the companys approach to engagement with regulators and policymakers including political parties and governments following the agm the board of directors initiated further engagement to facilitate a clear understanding of the reasons underpinning the votes cast against the resolution this included writing to the companys largest shareholders and offering to discuss how the company proposed to respond to points raised during the initial consultation and policy on stakeholder engagement the company is grateful to those shareholders that provided feedback at that time the company regularly engages with regulators and policymakers in the uk europe and usa including those associated with political parties and governments to understand and contribute to discussions on a wide range of matters which are associated with our business and delivering increased value to our shareholders this approach is detailed on pages 32 and 33 of the 2018 annual report as a fundamental aspect of our stakeholder engagement political and regulatory risk has been identified by the board as one of the nine principal risks that the business faces activities of this nature are not designed to support any political party or to influence public support for a particular party and would not be thought of as political donations in the ordinary sense of those words reflecting the feedback received from shareholders it has been determined that within future annual reports additional disclosure will be provided this will describe the forms of engagement that have taken place with regulators and policymakers in the financial year as well as additional disclosure regarding the oversight of that engagement to assure shareholders of the governance associated with managing engagement and transparency the company has also developed and published a policy explaining how stakeholder engagement is undertaken including oversight and associated reporting  the term political donation is widely defined in the companies act 2006 the act for clarity the company has not made and does not intend to knowingly make political donations the company continues to believe it is in the best interests of the business and shareholders to renew the authority most recently granted at the 2019 agm to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the act prior to 2019 the company had proposed an authority to spend up to 50000 under each of the three categories covered by the act at the 2019 agm drax sought an authority to spend up to 100000 under the same three categories which was approved by a majority of shareholdersnonetheless and reflecting feedback received in connection with the resolution at the 2020 and future agms the company will propose an authority to spend up to 100000 in each of the three categories but will introduce an aggregate cap of 125000 further explanation on these matters and our ongoing engagement with shareholders will be included in the 2019
