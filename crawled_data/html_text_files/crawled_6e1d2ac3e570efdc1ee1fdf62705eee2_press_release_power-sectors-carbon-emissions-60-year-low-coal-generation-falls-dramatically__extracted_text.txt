during the last quarter of 2016 carbon emissions from britains power sector fell to their lowest level for 60 years as more coal came off the system making way for renewables the new figures were revealed in the latest electric insights quarterly report produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax 2016 saw the most dramatic shift in the makeup of electricity generation since the 1984 miners strike coal generation fell 61 from the previous year as a mixture of low gas prices and the carbon price floor continued to force it off the system gas generation was up by more than 50 the septemberdecember period saw low carbon sources provide an average of 40 of britains electricity needs over the quarter peaking at a record 81 high over the christmas period wind output was low  over the quarter it was 7 down on the same period in 2015 this winter has seen fewer large storms resulting in lower average wind speeds compared to previous years wind speeds in q4 2016 were down 15 on 2015 the lowest since 2012 despite this when storm barbara passed through just before christmas it enabled wind power to pass the 10gw barrier for the first time in britain beating the previous record of 94gw set in 2014 however wind farms also spent a whole day producing on average less than 07gw  an output of just 5 of their installed capacity andy koss drax power ceo said these figures highlight a truly seismic shift in the balance of power coal continues to disappear at a dramatic rate and we can see the impact of intermittent renewables which have been affected by dramatic weather events low gas prices and the carbon price floor are forcing coal off the system and helping to ensure the uk is on track to meet its carbon targets for the power generation industry its essential the uks energy system is supported by the right mix of power generation coaltobiomass conversions and gas peaking plants are the best way to get coal off the system quickly and cost effectively whilst ensuring security of supply dr iain staffell of imperial college london said these figures clearly show that the carbon price floor cpf has played an important part in relegating coal to a more climatefriendly role providing infrequent peaking power at times of greatest need allowing lower carbon gas to take over as the baseload generator over the last two years the cpf has added 05pkwh to the cost of generation or about 3 of a household electricity bill in return it has played a major part in reducing carbon emissions by a third making it excellent value for money the report also found that britain became a net exporter to france for the first time in six years due to a crisis with french nuclear stations but exports were limited due to the interconnector being damaged the loss of imports from france left the power market tight with national grid issuing notices of thin margins power price volatility grew with peak prices over 1500mwh electric insights will be published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  wwwelectricinsightscouk  which provides live data from 2009 until the present the data sources and methodology used in electric insights are listed in full on the website commissioned by drax group owner and operator of the uks largest power station and europes biggest biomassfuelled power plant the report will be delivered independently by dr iain staffell from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the full report can be read here ends contact jenny

was commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by national grid and elexon who run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year it will focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009 until the present it was designed by the economist groups independent data design agency signal  noise generation from coal fell 61 in 2016 from the previous year whilst gas was up 51 and low carbon reached its highest ever output this was the largest annual swing in fuel shares since the miners strike of 1984 and the largest ever in percentage terms during storm barbara wind generation peaked at 108gw throughout a 30minute period on december 23 however wind farms also spent a whole day producing on average less than 07gw each half hourly period  an output of just 5 of the installed capacity about drax drax
