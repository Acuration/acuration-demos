climate policy forests and biomass transport contact us drax starts operations at leola satellite pellet plant in arkansas drax group the worlds leading producer and user of sustainable biomass is ramping up to full production at leola  the first of three new satellite pellet plants it plans for arkansas 10 february 2022 leola in grant county arkansas is part of a 40 million investment by drax in the state creating approximately 30 new direct jobs across all the three sites planned for arkansas as well as many more indirect jobs including leola draxs operates six pellet plants in the us which use biomass sourced from sustainably managed working forests in louisiana arkansas and mississippi the pellets are used at drax power station in england to generate renewable electricity for millions of uk homes and businesses draxs conversion of its uk power station to sustainable biomass from coal was europes largest decarbonisation project reducing emissions from draxs power generation by 90 since 2012 sustainable biomass is enabling draxs plans to deploy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  a pioneering negative emissions technology which permanently removes millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere matt white drax executive vice president pellet operations said drax has made excellent progress in delivering our 40m investment in arkansas with leola  the first of three planned satellite pellet plants  now in operation the investments were making will bring 30 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs and opportunities to rural communities in arkansas alongside supporting international efforts to tackle climate change these plants support draxs plans to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  a vital negative emissions technology that will be needed around the world to tackle the climate emergency the three satellite plants in arkansas are expected to produce a total of around 120000 tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets a year from sawmill residues this supports draxs plans to double its pellet production capacity to 8 million tonnes by 2030 to meet its own requirements as well as its customers needs in europe and asia amid an expected increase in global demand for the lowcarbon fuel the satellite plants are located near sawmills so they can use the sawdust and other byproducts produced when timber is processed to make the pellets siting the pellet facilities near sawmills reduces infrastructure operational and transportation costs construction of the second arkansas satellite plant in russellville pope county is underway with commissioning expected this year drax is continuing to develop plans for a third plant picture caption aerial view of the drax leola pellet plant site in grant county arkansas media contacts selina williams media manager e email protected t 44 7912 230 393 editors notes the sustainable biomass pellets produced at the new satellite plants will be transported to bruce oakley terminal in little rock ark before being shipped south to louisiana to oceangoing vessels each pellet plant is expected to produce 40kt per year with the cluster expected to produce120kt per year in total in addition to leola drax has 13 operational pellet plants across the us south and western canada with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further plant currently commissioning in demopolis alabama with other developmentsexpansions which will increase production capacity to c5mt the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to draxs power station in the uk and thirdparty customers in europe and asia to generate renewable power in 2020 around 43 of the material used to produce the pellets used to generate renewable power at drax power station came from sawmill residues sawdust and other byproducts the rest came from lowgrade material such as treetops limbs and misshapen and diseased trees not suitable for other use and thinnings  small trees removed to maximise the growth of the forest about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 3400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 13 operational pellet plants with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further two plants currently commissioning and other developmentsexpansions which will increase this to c5mt once complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers drax is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses supplying 100 renewable electricity as standard to more than 370000 sites through drax and opus energy it offers a
