archives press release new smart meter to give draxs business customers more control of their energy 17 june 2020 press releases trial of polyphase smets 2 smart meters aimed at giving draxs larger business customers better control of their power use making them more sustainable the trial is the first of its kind to develop technology that will pave the way for more sophisticated smart metering solutions the technology needed to install the newest smart meters in businesses with larger and more complex electricity supplies such as schools or large commercial premises hasnt been available so some of the largest energy users have been unable to benefit from the smartest technologies polyphase smets2 smart meters will allow larger businesses to track their energy usage and use the same software used by the millions of singlephase smart meters installed in homes and small businesses across the uk the new technology could enable draxs energy supply businesses haven power and opus energy to offer large business customers access to smart metering technology giving them greater control over their energy use with the potential to operate more sustainably paul sheffield managing director of draxs customers business said were confident that this new smart meter technology is going to be a game changer for thousands of our larger customers this technology will enable them to enjoy greater flexibility and control over their electricity use making them more sustainable which will be good for both the environment and their bottom line the meters will be field tested with selected drax business customers such as utilities and large nhs trusts in the autumn the work by drax the dcc and edmi has continued despite the covid19 pandemic with all partners working remotely to develop and test the technology the project has included establishing a new polyphase smart meter testing lab where the new technology is being developed within the dccs manchester facility the operational headquarters of britains smart meter network the facility can test 2400 smart meters simultaneously and has a technical operation centre which can monitor the install and operation of every smart meter across the country the new smart meters will operate securely on the network using a specialist software platform from utiligroup a key technologyservices partner of drax dan lambert chief operating officer for the dcc said the dccs network is the digital backbone of the energy industry and our customers like drax are constantly working to help us extend its reach to more homes and businesses polyphase smart meters will make it available to even more businesses from farms to tech startups its been impressive how well the whole sector has collaborated throughout lockdown on this complex work with our customers were making britain more connected so we can all lead smarter greener lives alan masterman managing director of smart meter manufacturer edmi europe limited said we are incredibly proud of the work this partnership is achieving smart meters are the foundation of the energy revolution and are therefore an essential component for large businesses that have previously not had access to smart technology at edmi we are committed to the development of products that best meet market demands for our customers the close working of both drax and the dcc has

drax power station 11m refurbishment of historic drax hydro power station 10 june 2020 press releases the lanark hydro scheme which comprises both stonebyres and bonnington power stations was the first largescale hydroelectric scheme in britain when it was completed in 1927  producing enough electricity for around 17000 homes using the plentiful supply of water from the river clyde to spin the power stations turbines the hydro scheme can operate almost continuously throughout the year to provide a reliable and sustainable source of renewable electricity senior civil engineer anne kerr and head of hydro ian kinnaird view the station from a bridge over the river clyde the refurbishment of the power station was a complex task due to stonebyres being a category a listed building  the highest possible grading as a result of it being designated as a site of national architectural importance  the restoration of the historic site was led by drax group senior civil engineer anne kerr restoring stonebyres has been a labour of love for my team she explained it was a complex and challenging project involving a great deal of care to protect the stations many original features it has been a real privilege to not only safeguard stonebyres history but to play a part in its future too anne kerr and ian kinnaird in front of the newly refurbished power station as part of the project every original pane of glass and window frame in the building was painstakingly replaced using stronger modern materials but which retain the stations original design the power stations exterior received a new concrete coating as well as a coat of mineralbased paint to protect the integrity of the building for decades to come the 11m refurbishment has transformed stonebyres ian kinnaird draxs head of hydro said stonebyres power station has been producing reliable renewable electricity for almost a century and this major refurbishment will ensure it continues to do so for many years to come since the refurbishment the station looks almost brand new  you would be forgiven for not realising it has been generating electricity for the area since 1927 scotland has a long and proud history of hydroelectricity and with this project drax is ensuring these power stations play an important part in securing a net zero carbon future for our country drax acquired the lanark hydro scheme alongside the galloway hydro scheme and the cruachan pumpedhydro storage facility in argyll in january 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible low carbon and renewable power generation
