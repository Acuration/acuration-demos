from building giant power station chimney one of the workers who built the uks tallest industrial chimney at a north yorkshire power station has returned to the site to mark its anniversary  half a century on from the structure being completed 23 may 2019 harry shann now 83 was part of the team who worked at drax power station 50 years ago constructing the 850ft high chimney which has three flues linked to the sites six generating units four of which now run on sustainable biomass instead of coal the chimney took just four months to build after work started in early 1969 and was completed four months ahead of schedule by a team of around 30 workers with the topping out ceremony held in may to celebrate its completion now harry who was just 33 when he joined the project and still lives locally in selby has spent time back at the drax site to reflect on his involvement in the recordbreaking construction project he said i still see it pretty much every day it was definitely the highest build i ever worked on im very proud of it even after all these years and i can still remember the time i spent on site considering the size of it though we werent there long we really got a move on due to the height of the structure reaching the top can only be achieved by an eightminute journey in an industrial lift or by scaling the 1460 steps spiralling up the central void of the chimney views from the top can stretch as far as the humber bridge more than 30 miles away on a clear day  and harry admits it was only a job for those who were comfortable working high above the ground i just never had a fear of heights i was in the parachute regiment before i became a scaffolder so that might have had something to do with it the octogenarian said on his return visit to view the huge structure he helped to create being back at drax power station i realise just how much its changed when i worked here looking down from the chimney the area was bare with hardly any buildings now its just amazing its a wonderful site and i feel proud that the chimney is still standing 50 years later the north yorkshire power station which first began generating electricity in 1974 when the first of its six generating units was commissioned now produces enough electricity to supply five per cent of the uks power and is the biggest decarbonisation project in europe drax power ceo andy koss said harrys efforts along with his colleagues in building such an important and iconic part of the power station are an integral part of draxs history and ongoing success 50 years on it is still the tallest industrial chimney in the uk  in many ways its completion marked the start of a rich heritage for engineering excellence and innovation at drax which has continued to the present day earlier this year drax confirmed that its groundbreaking trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs using technology developed by leedsbased ccapture had become the first project of its kind in the world to capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock drax has converted twothirds of its generating units at the site near selby to use sustainable biomass instead of coal transforming the business to become the largest renewable power generator in the uk ends chimney facts drax chimneys foundations are 70ftdeep the 44000 tonne chimney cost around 1 million to build its almost twice the height of the great pyramid of giza the record for the highest chimney in the world belongs to the gres2 power station in kazakhstan built in 1987 it stands 1377ft 420m tall media
