clean is my electric car while many see evs as the cleanest way to drive they are still the subject of much speculation electric insights special report by dr iain staffell iain staffell imperial college london 29 august 2019 opinion electric vehicles are fast becoming mainstream there are now well over 200000 on britains roads and this number is growing by 30 per year 1 in 40 cars sold in britain is now electric around one third of which are pure battery models and two thirds are plugin hybrid 1 this radical shift is just beginning though britains electric vehicle fleet is expected to expand tenfold over the next five to ten years in more optimistic scenarios half of all vehicles on the road could be electric just fifteen years from now 2 while many see evs as the cleanest way to drive they are still the subject of much speculation recent criticisms range from a uk government report saying they wont end air pollution 3 to a string of studies often debunked claiming they emit more co 2 than diesel equivalents 4 the arguments are simple how can it be cleaner to swap a petrol car for electric if it is recharged using electricity from dirty coal or gas secondly how can electric vehicles repay the energy needed for mining lithium and to assemble the huge batteries that power them we review academic studies of battery manufacture and use data from electric insights to answer these questions on average britains evs emit just one quarter the co 2 of conventional petrol and diesel vehicles if the carbon emitted in making their battery is included this rises to only half the co 2 of a conventional vehicle electric vehicles bought today could be emitting just a tenth that of a petrol car in five years time as the electricity system is widely expected to continue moving towards lowcarbon sources manufacturing each kwh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol 5 electric vehicles typically have a battery capacity ranging from 30 kwh for small city hatchbacks up to 100 kwh for topend models  manufacturing the latter emits as much carbon as three roundtheworld flights more co 2 is emitted in building the battery for premium ev model than from the recharging it over a 15year lifetime 6 however the most efficient ev models could need just two to three years of driving to save the amount of carbon emitted in producing their batteries smaller evs with modest battery sizes are better for the environment whereas the largest luxury ev models could need three times longer to pay back their carbon cost hatchbacks small hatchbacks are the bestselling type of electric vehicles led by the nissan leaf they are also the cleanest to drive as they are small and light electric models currently emit around 33 grams of co 2 per km driven which is one quarter that of the most popular conventional vehicle a 2019 ford fiesta volkwagen eup electric car showcased at the frankfurt iaa motor show 2017 these electric models typically come with a 3045 kwh battery which pushes their lifetime emissions up around 60 gkm this is still less than half the emissions of a petrol or diesel car with the projected changes to the grid mix this will fall to less than one third of a standard car in just five years time ev models nissan leaf renault zoe volkswagen egolf and eup hyundai kona and bmw i3 battery size 39 kwh on average 3146 kwh central range lifetime carbon content of the battery 26 gkm driven on average 1834 gkm central range emissions with 201819 grid mix 2838 gkm from recharging 4572 gkm including battery emissions with 2025 grid mix 1220 gkm from recharging 2852 gkm including battery luxury luxury saloons and suv models include the iconic tesla models s and x and the new jaguar ipace these are much larger and need more energy to move meaning they have higher emissions than hatchbacks at 4454 gkm this is still just a quarter of the emissions from a comparable conventional car a top of the range mercedes sclass jaguar i pace ev the lifetime emissions of these luxury evs are notably higher though pushed up by the enormous 90100 kwh batteries they use to provide a driving range of over 250 miles these batteries are responsible for more co 2 emissions than driving the car over its entire lifetime models considered jaguar ipace tesla model s and model x battery size 97 kwh on average 90100 kwh central range lifetime carbon content of the battery 63 gkm driven on average 4780 gkm central range emissions with 201819 grid mix 4454 gkm from recharging 92133 gkm including battery emissions with 2025 grid mix 1929 gkm from recharging 63103 gkm including battery vans electric vans are quickly taking off with over 8000 sold in britain to date their performance is comparable to small hatchbacks and they also currently emit around a quarter of the co2 of the most popular conventional van with around 40 gkm a white nissan env200 electric van makes deliveries in london with their 3040 kwh battery pack included this rises to just below half the co 2 of a small ford transit models considered nissan env200 and renault kangoo battery size 37 kwh on average 3340 kwh central range lifetime carbon content of the battery 24 gkm driven on average 1831 gkm central range emissions with 201819 grid mix 3743 gkm from recharging 5474 gkm including battery emissions with 2025 grid mix 1523 gkm from recharging  3252 gkm including battery payback time a typical driver filling their car up once a month and driving around 7500 miles per year will produce one and a half tonnes of co 2 per year in a modern petrol or diesel hatchback an electric vehicle doing the same mileage would take 4 years to produce this amount with a conventional vehicle there is no scope for reducing emissions over its lifetime as petrol and diesel fuels cannot become carbonfree on the contrary national grid expect the carbon content of britains electricity to continue falling so that an electric vehicle bought now will be emitting half as much co 2 in 2025 as it does today it is inconceivable that an electric vehicle in the uk could be more polluting than its conventional equivalent this would require electricity to have a carbon intensity of around 850950 gkwh values not seen since the 1960s 7 electric vehicles can be thought of as having an upfront carbon cost for manufacturing the battery which can then be repaid through lower emissions as they are driven with britains current grid electricity producing 205 gkwh smaller electric cars and vans will take between 2 and 4 years to have saved the amount of co 2 than was emitted in making their batteries for the larger luxury models it will take more like 56 years of driving to pay back that carbon with each passing year as the electricity mix gets cleaner this payback time will continue to fall and the environmental credentials of electric vehicles will keep growing stronger about this study the fuel economy and climate impact of vehicles are measured by the government through the amount of co 2 they release for every kilometre driven the uks most popular car the ford fiesta emits around 120 gkm in its cleanest models and 160 gkm in the sportier versions 9 electric vehicles dont emit any co 2 while driving but the power system does when producing the electricity needed to recharge them britains power system has changed dramatically over the last five years with carbon emissions halving and the share of coal generation falling from 36 to just 3 one kwh of electricity in britain is now contains 204 grams10 of co 2  less than the carbon released from burning one kwh of petrol an electric vehicle can drive up to four times further on 1 kwh than a petrol or diesel car could because electric motors are so much more efficient the charts above look at three categories of vehicle  small hatchbacks luxury saloons and suvs and small commercial vans each chart shows how the carbon emissions from an electric vehicle have fallen over the past decade and how they are expected to continue falling in the years to come the charts consider changes to the electricity generation mix used for recharging 11 and a gradual reduction in emissions from battery manufacture as the electricity mix changes in other countries 12 the range in direct emissions from recharging the dark blue bands covers the main ev models currently on sale in each segment and variants on each model available the top of each band highest emissions shows the least efficient ev model the bottom of each band lowest emissions shows the most efficient in the forecast these bands also include the range of emissions factors for electricity production coming from national grids scenarios there is a larger range in the estimated wholelifecycle emissions the lighter blue bands due to the additional uncertainty in the emissions caused by manufacturing 1 kwh of battery capacity and the range of battery sizes seen across ev models studies have estimated a wide range of emissions depending on the type of battery type its design where it is manufactured and how old the study is current estimates range from 40 up to 200 kg of co 2 emitted per kwh of battery capacity 13 we take the average across eight studies and assume 75125 kgco 2 per kwh the true value may be less than this as endoflife batteries could be recycled 14 or could be repurposed as a secondlife home or grid storage batteries it will also reduce in future as the electricity used to make batteries is decarbonised or as more factories

manufacture of 75125 kgco2 per kwh 7 this includes the carbon cost of manufacturing the battery if just the emissions from driving are considered electric vehicles would need to be charged with electricity containing 9001000 gkwh to emit more co2 than petrol or diesel equivalents 8 each electric vehicle model was matched to an approximate equivalent the average and range across all model variants both diesel and petrol was considered and all vehicles used emissions measured under the wltp test where wltp test data were not available emissions were estimated from the nedc test cycle

testing method which aims to represent realworld driving 10 12 month average to june 2019 having fallen from 444 gkwh in the 12 months to june 2014 11 using the four scenarios presented by the national grid future energy scenarios  12 assuming a 1 per year reduction in the carbon intensity of electricity worldwide based on historic progress over the last decade note that decarbonisation
