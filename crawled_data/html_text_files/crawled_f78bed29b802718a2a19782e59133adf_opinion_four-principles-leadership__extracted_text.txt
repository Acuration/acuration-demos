four principles of leadership drax group chief executive dorothy thompson reflects on her career so far drawing on lessons of leadership from britain to botswana dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 2 june 2016 opinion 1 have vision the first task of any leader is to have the vision for the future of their organisation this doesnt mean creating it on his or her own it means that a leader needs to be ready to challenge assumptions embrace change have courage and be brave when necessary when i think about this im reminded of the challenges we faced when we decided to upgrade our power station in yorkshire to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal  in delivering this strategy we faced three major hurdles nobody had ever done it before there was no technical solution readily available we had to create one ourselves using our own engineering knowhow there was no supply chain for the compressed wood pellets we would need to build our own civil servants doubted we could deliver it and regardless there was no government support for our vision because we had been so thorough i knew that we had our facts right in particular i was certain that we could produce the same amount of electricity while cutting carbon by 80 per cent the only logical conclusion was to drive forward it would never have happened if we hadnt been confident about our vision im particularly proud of the way drax engineers have developed a worldleading technology to transform the way the uks largest power station works without any interruption to supply in 2015 we generated 79 of the uks electricity or 267 twh from the one single site in north yorkshire according to data in our annual report and from the department for energy and climate change decc  that included 115 twh of compressed wood pellet power  equal to around 13 of the uks total renewable electricity up from 12 a year earlier or enough to meet the needs of around three million homes one in every 10 in the country from the fourth quarter of 2015 we began generating more electricity from sustainable biomass than from coal theres still a long way to go  at least three years if not more  before we can say our work is done but its already a massive achievement 2 always be open and approachable everyone in your organisation needs to understand what youre seeking to achieve and why for me being open is also about being honest approachable and interested in other views not just as an individual but as an entire organisation as president obama said while addressing young people on his recent visit to the uk seek out people who dont agree with you and it will also help you to compromise in some instances you need to push forward while in others you need to compromise that means a leader needs to trust in their vision while being open to challenges at drax we know our employees have integrity and can be trusted at all levels people need to have highly sensitive information to do their job this can be a very challenging issue for a company listed on the london stock exchange where a leak could do very serious damage indeed when we first listed in 2005 this led to boardroom disagreement on one side directors wanted to restrict information to a minimum because they felt this was the best way to limit risk as chief executive i strongly disagreed with this obviously some things need to be kept confidential but i really believe that it is important for a leader to be open in fact i think one of the key strengths of the group is our open and frank culture we have never suffered a significant leak in my time in charge 3 together were stronger a leaders role is not to take all the decisions leadership is about getting the best out of everyone around you that includes the team you work with on a daytoday basis the wider team across the whole organisation and all your stakeholders you never know in advance where the best idea is going to come from if youre recruitment is right youre surrounded by highly qualified experts at drax i encourage colleagues to have their say i am surrounded by people who are willing and able to challenge my views and those of my colleagues on our executive committee i would be silly not to listen to them we all are more engaged when were involved in finding the solution to a problem than when were merely dictated to central business district gaborone botswana 4 drive the future no leader can wait for events to unfold you have to drive your organisation forward in order to shape its future in my opinion indecision is the worst decision of all in my 20s i worked for the national development bank of botswana in gaborone the bank provided farmers with short term loans to buy seed to grow their crops one day a farmer who was clearly very poor turned up to see the loan officer who shared an office with me he hadnt received his loan because the loan officer hadnt processed his application in time so there were no seeds to plant and no crops for the next season for years i blamed the loan officer for the farmers misfortune however from my practical experience as a leader i now know better the loan officers manager who was afraid to reprimand him because he came from a privileged local family should have had more courage because they couldnt decide how to handle the situation the company and the community it served suffered leadership is not an exact science and nothing can compare to experience for the sake of future generations the world needs to urgently move away from coal unlike the manager in gaborone who jeopardised a farmers future my drax colleagues and i know our leadership is driving the future towards the decarbonisation of our economy share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways
