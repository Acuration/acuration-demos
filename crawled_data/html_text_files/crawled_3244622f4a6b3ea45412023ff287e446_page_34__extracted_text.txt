engineering design feed study at drax was secured through the governments ccud phase 2 competition the fuelcell system captures up to 85 tonnes of co 2 per day while generating additional power the fuel cell runs on natural gas which creates additional co 2 emissions  these are also captured during the process it will also destroy up to 70 of the nox emissions from draxs flue gases fces carbonate fuel cell is modular and this demonstration project will utilise two standard fuel cell modules similar to fces suresource3000 commercial power generation system drax power station is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world  around 75 of the electricity it produces is renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  delivering negative emissions the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 drax is already capturing a tonne of co 2 from its first beccs pilot project  the first of its kind in the world using an organic solvent developed by leeds university spin out ccapture drax announced in may it had signed a

minister for energy and clean growth said carbon capture usage and storage technologies are not only putting fizz in our drinks but feeding fish too as we move towards net zero emissions and end our contribution to global warming innovative projects like this will help reduce agricultural emissions and meet increasing demand for animal feed demonstrating the enormous global potential ccus has to tackle climate change peter rowe deep branch biotechnology ceo explained that the method they have developed for producing proteins from co 2  relies on an edible microbe that consumes carbon dioxide when fed carbon dioxide the microbes grow and reproduce enabling them to be continually harvested for protein whilst maintaining a growing culture under optimal conditions up to 70 per cent of the material produced is protein download graphic high res no logo high res with logo the benefits of this process over other carbon capture technologies is that the co 2 does not need to be separated from the power stations flue gases before being fed to the microbes peter said meat production is set to double by 2050 as global populations increase but using existing methods of producing animal feeds to meet this growing demand is completely unsustainable the technology weve developed is an exciting solution we can convert up to 6070 of co 2 into protein helping to both minimise the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere during power generation and other industrial processes whilst producing protein for animal feeds which will help reduce the impact of agricultural sectors on the environment as well the usa is the worlds biggest soy producer producing one third of global supply and uses 97 to produce animal feed over 60 of cereals grown globally are being used in animal feeds along with 20 million tonnes of oceancaught fish concerns about overfishing have seen the aquaculture farmed fish industry boom yet this industry uses more than 15 of oceancaught fish for feed in the form of fishmeal the new proteins created using the deep branch biotechnology could help reduce the quantities of fish removed from the oceans this not only minimises the impact on ecosystems but decreases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mitigating the harmful effects of climate change the deep branch pilot will get underway in the autumn when a demonstration plant will be installed within the drax ccus incubation area it aims to capture enough co 2 to produce 100kg of protein to be used to create feedstocks for fish and livestock the protein generated from the project will be used in a trial project with a major feed producer if successful deep branch biotechnology plans to build a larger production facility by 2020 so it can produce several tonnes of protein per

from its four biomass generating units the agricultural sector was one highlighted by the committee on climate change in its net zero report as being too slow to make progress in reducing emissions the uns food and agriculture organisation has found that around a third of all global cropland is used to grow animal feed in the form of soy around 15 per cent of all fish caught globally are turned into feed for commercial fisheries according to analysis by the uks sea fish industry authority  using bacteria to make protein for animal feed was first considered in the 1970s it is now more economically viable as producing fishmeal powder from milling and drying fish parts has become more expensive and has not kept up with growing human demand for fish about deep branch biotechnology

response from industry following committee on climate changes net zero report plan could deliver the uks first zero carbon cluster and help position great britain at the heart of the global energy revolution this is the first significant action from industry since the uk committee on climate change ccc recently published its net zero report which found that ccus and hydrogen technology developed in regional industrial clusters is essential if great britain is going to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050 the partnership could lead to the humber becoming the worlds first net zero carbon region and home to a new world leading hydrogen economy viewdownload graphic with grey background or white background commenting on the partnership will gardiner drax group ceo said the committee on climate change was clear  the uk needs both bioenergy with ccs and hydrogen production at scale by 2030 to achieve a net zero carbon economy this partnership is committed to meeting this challenge putting great britain at the heart of the global energy revolution with draxs carbon negative power station the humber region could lead the world in new technologies that can deliver for the climate and the economy helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses were excited to be working with national grid ventures and equinor on this project  for decades the humber has been a strategically important industrial cluster for the uk  it has the skills industrial capability as well as offshore storage to transform itself into a cuttingedge low carbon hub drax power station north yorkshire click to viewdownload irene rummelhoff equinors executive vice president for marketing midstream and processing said as a global leader in ccs and a major gas supplier to the uk for many decades we are committed to helping shape sustainable solutions for a low carbon future we are pleased to be partnering with drax and national grid ventures in looking at how the humber region can be a launch pad for wider decarbonisation in the uk economy and be an example for others to learn from globally we must see substantial decarbonisation of industry and energy in the years ahead and we believe ccs and hydrogen must play a significant role in this equinors snøhvit offshore development in the

private sectors to harness the humbers key strengths and capabilities and help it become the worlds first netzero carbon industrial cluster these include its position as the largest industrial cluster in the uk by emissions its proximity to drax power station which could become the single largest source of negative emissions in the uk through its beccs project the extensive engineering design work previously undertaken to develop a largescale carbon transportation and storage network in the region as part of the white rose ccs project its proximity to the endurance and bunter aquifer in the north sea a large natural co 2 store which could be used by the humber and other nearby industrial clusters to permanently store their carbon emissions drax announced in february that is has started to capture carbon dioxide from its beccs pilot project using technology developed by leeds university spinout company ccapture this is the firsttime carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100 biomass feedstock anywhere in the world since starting its innovative beccs pilot project drax has been talking to several industries about using its co 2 in their processes this could be to produce concrete within the food and drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hardtodecarbonise sectors like aviation it has set up a dedicated incubation area at the power station that will give other technology companies the opportunity to test their processes on its carbon dioxide drax power station is already the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal if the beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 mt co2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero today drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its pilot  once scaled up it would be capturing 40000 tonnes of carbon a day from its four biomass generating units thats at a 90 capture rate the cccs net zero report also identified that at least one of the uks ccus regional clusters should involve substantial production of lowcarbon hydrogen by 2030 to stay on track for net zero it also recommends that infrastructure development for ccus should start as early as possible in all regional clusters with large industrial emissions the recently published h21 north of england study has also shown that up to 37 million homes as well as other industrial processes could be converted from natural gas to hydrogen to meet the uks climate change targets about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its

chimney 23 may 2019 press releases harry shann now 83 was part of the team who worked at drax power station 50 years ago constructing the 850ft high chimney which has three flues linked to the sites six generating units four of which now run on sustainable biomass instead of coal the chimney took just four months to build after work started in early 1969 and was completed four months ahead of schedule by a team of around 30 workers with the topping out ceremony held in may to celebrate its completion now harry who was just 33 when he joined the project and still lives locally in selby has spent time back at the drax site to reflect on his involvement in the recordbreaking construction project he said i still see it pretty much every day it was definitely the highest build i ever worked on im very proud of it even after all these years and i can still remember the time i spent on site considering the size of it though we werent there long we really got a move on due to the height of the structure reaching the top can only be achieved by an eightminute journey in an industrial lift or by scaling the 1460 steps spiralling up the central void of the chimney views from the top can stretch as far as the humber bridge more than 30 miles away on a clear day  and harry admits it was only a job for those who were comfortable working high above the ground i just never had a fear of heights i was in the parachute regiment before i became a scaffolder so that might have had something to do with it the octogenarian said on his return visit to view the huge structure he helped to create being back at drax power station i realise just how much its changed when i worked here looking down from the chimney the area was bare with hardly any buildings now its just amazing its a wonderful site and i feel proud that the chimney is still standing 50 years later the north yorkshire power station which first began generating electricity in 1974 when the first of its six generating units was commissioned now produces enough electricity to supply five per cent of the uks power and is the biggest decarbonisation project in europe drax power ceo andy koss said harrys efforts along with his colleagues in building such an important and iconic part of the power station are an integral part of draxs history and ongoing success 50 years on it is still the tallest industrial chimney in the uk  in many ways its completion marked the start of a rich heritage for engineering excellence and innovation at drax which has continued to the present day earlier this year drax confirmed that its groundbreaking trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs using technology developed by leedsbased ccapture had become the first project of its kind in the world to capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock drax has converted twothirds of its generating units at the site near selby to use sustainable biomass instead of coal transforming the business to become the largest renewable power generator in the uk ends chimney facts drax chimneys foundations are 70ftdeep the 44000 tonne chimney cost around 1 million to build its almost twice the height of the great pyramid of giza the record for the highest chimney in the world belongs to the gres2 power station in kazakhstan built in 1987 it stands 1377ft 420m tall media contacts mark duffell mcd communications
