statement drax group plc annual general meeting 25 april 2018 investors rns number  0475m drax group plc drax holds its annual general meeting at 1130am today at the grand hotel  spa station rise york yo1 6gd at this meeting philip cox cbe  chairman of drax group and will gardiner  chief executive officer ceo of drax group will make the following comments philip cox cbe chairman said 2017 was an important year for the group with the development of our strategy a new dividend policy and the departure of dorothy thompson who announced her intention to stand down as ceo i would like to thank dorothy for her enormous contribution to the group over the last 13 years dorothy is succeeded by will gardiner who was previously group chief financial officer cfo and a key architect of our strategy his appointment follows a thorough review of internal and external candidates and is a natural progression after two years working alongside dorothy developing our strategy which remains clear and unchanged i am confident this strategy will create significant benefits for all draxs stakeholders will gardiner ceo said i am very pleased to have taken over as ceo of the drax group i have greatly enjoyed working alongside dorothy thompson for the past two years as cfo having worked closely with the board and executive team  i know that i will be leading a great team i have also worked closely on developing our strategy and i look forward to continuing to deliver it and taking advantage of the opportunities ahead in 2017 we made significant progress with the strategy we announced in december 2016  we completed the acquisition of opus energy  a leading challenger brand in the uk small and mediumsized enterprise sme energy market we acquired a third biomass pellet plant  lasalle bioenergy  which significantly increases our pellet production capacity and we continued to develop options for flexible gas generation at four sites around the uk as well as the exploration of coaltogas repowering at drax power station to support our strategy we completed a refinancing in may and announced a new dividend policy in june we have a major role to play in supporting the uk energy system as it becomes increasingly ambitious in decarbonising with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we are working on a fourth biomass unit conversion  through this flexible lowcarbon and customerfocused approach we aim to deliver higher quality earnings with a reduction in commodity exposure alongside opportunities for growth safety remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we have performed well in this regard although we continue to work to improve our performance across the group biomass is a challenging fuel to manage we work very hard to manage it carefully but unfortunately in december we had a fire at drax power station it cost us several weeks of production but most importantly no one was hurt we are currently incorporating the lessons learned from that incident in our operations to ensure that we operate as safely as we can our financial performance which we measure with reference to ebitda was 229 million in 2017 significantly ahead of 2016 140 million this increase was principally from producing high levels of renewable power from sustainable biomass and growth in our energy supply and pellet production businesses i am very pleased that all three of our businesses generated positive ebitda 1 last year for the first time in june we announced a new dividend policy this policy is to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows in determining the rate of growth in dividends the board will take account of contracted cash flows the less predictable cash flows from the groups commodity based business and future investment opportunities if there is a buildup of capital the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders for 2017 we are recommending a total basic dividend of 50 million 123 pence per share inclusive of a final dividend of 30 million equivalent to 74 pence per share we are also currently undertaking a 50 million share buyback programme this is consistent with our capital allocation policy and commitment to returns to shareholders sustainability remains at the heart of the business both the specific sustainability of biomass and more broadly the longterm sustainability of the group biomass sustainability is in the financial and longterm interests of the business and we always strive to ensure all our pellets comply with our policy it is fundamental to us that the biomass we use is sustainable and meets statutory requirements we have a dedicated sustainability team whose role is to ensure the wood pellets we manufacture and use to generate electricity meet the requirements we have set ourselves in our sustainability policy and the criteria for sustainable biomass as established by the uk government philip cox cbe chairman added the board and its committees play an active role in guiding the company and leading its strategy we greatly value the contribution made by our nonexecutive directors and during a time of transition their role is especially important the board has been complemented by the appointment of two new nonexecutives firstly david nussbaum  whose indepth knowledge of sustainability will support our continued focus in this area and secondly nicola hodson  whose experience in technology business transformation and energy will provide real value as the group delivers its strategy as a board we are well aware that to achieve our strategic objectives our commitment to diversity is crucial and reducing our gender pay gap is an important part of this we must do more to attract retain and progress women to ensure were an employer of choice for everyone who sees their future in energy in this context we are supportive of the goals of hampton alexander  it only remains for me to say that your board remains totally committed to the complementary aims of delivering sustainable longterm value for the group and of helping our country build a lowcarbon economy  enquires investor relations mark strafford 44 0 1757 612491 media ali lewis 44 0 1757 612165 website
