great britains lowest carbon christmas 27 december 2017 great britains fairy lights and roasted turkeys were powered by the cleanest electricity mix ever on christmas day 2017  rounding off a record breaking year for power generation in britain according to analysis of electric insights data by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax 2017 is on course to be the cleanest year for electricity generation carbon emissions from power generation were just 142gkwh on christmas day  more than 10 lower than on december 25 2016  gas generators provided over 30 of the required capacity and coal provided just 14 on christmas day  compared to 179 for gas and 71 for coal in 2016 roasted turkeys were powered by the greenest electricity mix ever in 2017 dr iain staffell of imperial college london said this was achieved in spite of generation from renewables being lower than on christmas day last year mainly due to the continued reduction in coal over this year being swapped for gas power stations the low carbon christmas comes after a whole host of renewables records were broken throughout the year and with much less coal on the system helping to reduce britains carbon emissions by around half of what they were five years ago dr staffell explained the carbon intensity of britains electricity halved between 2012 and 2016 and we think that by new year the 2017 figure will be at least another 10 lower than last years record this means the average british household produced 100 kg less co 2 this year than they did last year without having to lift a finger all the changes are being made behind the scenes electric insights data also shows that january 17 2017 was the dirtiest day of the year with carbon intensity reaching 398g co 2 kwh despite this britains carbon emissions have fallen sharply as renewables records were broken throughout the year dr staffell said several real milestones were reached by renewable electricity throughout 2017  we set a new record in march for renewable generation which was then broken again in june it helped that wind speeds were relatively high during the year so wind farm output was up by around one third compared to last year also electricity demand was a little lower meaning that renewable output formed a bigger part of the mix the records broken throughout the year include february was a record breaking month for biomass with 21gw produced from biomass generation a new record for wind solar hydro and biomass power was made in the first three months of 2017 with 232 of britains power coming from these technologies over the first quarter however this record was then broken again in the next three months with almost a quarter of the uks electricity between april and june being generated sustainably  wind solar hydro and biomass accounted for 249 of the uks energy mix no coal was used in power stations for the first time in more than 130 years on april 22 nd dr iain staffell of imperial college london added this was a huge milestone the first day in which no electricity came from coal since the first steamdriven power station opened in the 1880s on 26 th may a new solar record was made with 31gw of energy produced throughout the day from solar  almost triple the yearly average of 12gw per day dr staffell said a great deal of new solar has been installed on the system which meant that the previous record was smashed june was the cleanest month of the year with 188g per kwh of carbon emitted compared to 339g per kwh in january  the dirtiest month dr staffell said this is due to demand being lower so we could make do with very little coal generation and gas was much lower too 8 th december saw a new record for wind energy with 116gw of electricity from wind power produced over the day dr staffell explained as with solar electricity new capacity made it easy for the previous wind power record to be broken 2017 was also a very windy year compared to 2016 interconnectors also had a recordbreaking year with the link to france reaching new highs for both imports and exports 26 th march saw 1994mw imported into britain from france while conversely 16 th november saw 2020mw exported from britain to france andy koss drax power ceo said britains energy system is rapidly changing as the carbon price floor continues to force coal off the system and gas and renewables play an increasingly important role in helping to reduce carbon emissions  all year round at drax we have upgraded half of the power station to run on flexible reliable sustainable biomass around 70 of the power we produce is now renewable  enough for four million households we are also looking at repowering two of our remaining coal generating units with gas to provide up to 36gw of power and developing up to 200mw of battery storage with the four rapid response gas power stations we are developing which will help to support the system and enable more renewables onto the grid here at drax we are playing an important part in helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media relations e email

th in the world following a 47 drop in emissions last year electricity generation in the uk is playing a vital role in the reduction of carbon emissions enabling other sectors like transport to become greener fewer fossil fuels on the system means electric vehicles are greener than ever before  the electricity sector has many accounting conventions to be aware of power flow is measured in gigawatts gw volumes of energy are measured in megawatthours mwh producing 1 gw constantly for an hour would give 1 gwh  1000 mwh producing 1 gw constantly for a year would give 8760 gwh which is enough to power 265 million homes about electric insights electric insights quarterly was commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the reports analyse raw data that is made publicly available by national grid and elexon which run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year the reports focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009 until the present it was designed by the economist groups independent data design agency signal noise total emissions are calculated from british electricity consumption in tonnes per hour including emissions from imported power and the carbon intensity of electricity  total emissions divided by total demand in grams per kilowatt hour
