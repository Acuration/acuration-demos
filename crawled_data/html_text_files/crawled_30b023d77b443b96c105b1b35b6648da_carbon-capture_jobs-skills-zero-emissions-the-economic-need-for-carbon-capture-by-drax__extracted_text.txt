revitalising the humber and building a net zero uk 18 november 2020 carbon capture the humber estuary is one of the most distinctive features of the uks eastern coastline viewed from above it is a crack in the land where the north sea merges with england  its this connection to the sea that has defined it as a region and led to its rich industrial history but in recent years as sectors such as heavy manufacturing move overseas the humber has begun to sink into economic decline these challenges are now being exacerbated by covid19  almost 60 of workers in the yorkshire and the humber construction industry were furloughed in august 2020 stimulation is needed to rejuvenate the humber and prevent lasting economic scars on the region and its workingage population decarbonisation offers the opportunity to rebuild the region for the 2020s and decades ahead technologies that have been identified as essential for the uk to reach its legallybinding commitment of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include carbon capture usage and storage ccus  trapping transporting and storing or recycling carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial processes and energy generation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  carbon removal from renewable sustainable biomass power generation that leads to negative emissions hydrogen production  switching processes from natural gas to this zeroemissions fuel the humber has unique capabilities that positions it as a hub for developing all three zero carbon humber zch  the partnership between a number of leading companies including drax aims to bring together these essential technologies and create the foundations from which the regions emissionsheavy industries can regain their competitive edge create jobs and rejuvenate the area a new report by vivid economics for drax investigates the potential economic impact of carbon capture and hydrogen it concluded that nearly 48000 jobs could be created and supported in the industrial cluster at the peak of the construction phase in 2027 its a chance to not just revitalise a powerhouse of northern england but to collaborate with other industrial clusters and build a ukwide green economy ready to export globally and attract international business to the region rejuvenating the humber the north sea has helped forge hulls strong industrial heritage of ship building and fishing in the 1950s the flat lands of the south bank enabled postwar industries such as refining chemicals and steel to thrive the regions economy is built around the ports and accessibility to europe and the north sea explains pauline wade director of international trade at the hull and humber chamber of commerce they are the biggest ports in the uk in terms of tonnage and the energy and chemical industries hinge on materials coming in and going out of them but these are also emissionsintensive industries and as a result the humber has the highest co 2 emissions of any uk industrial region  emitting 30 more than the second largest industrial cluster decarbonisation is vital in modernising and protecting these sectors and the 55000 manufacturing jobs they support decarbonisation brings opportunities many businesses in this region have that target very firmly set in their business plans says beckie hart regional director of the yorkshire and the humber cbi confederation of british industry many are high polluters  they know that but they are very keen to became part of the solution developing beccs ccus and hydrogen as well as building the infrastructure needed to capture and transport co 2  offers both immediate construction jobs and longterm skilled jobs the main construction period of the project would run from 2024 to 2031 and support up to 47800 new jobs at its peak in 2027 when 31 billion a year would be added to the regional economy these include up to 25200 high quality jobs in construction and operations as well as a further 24400 supported across the supply chain and wider economy these construction roles include jobs such as welders  pipe fitters  machine installers and technicians  with immediate government backing these jobs could be available in as little as four years ongoing operations will also create 3300 long term skilled jobs in the cluster in the early 2030s the supply chain needed to provide the materials and parts for the regions industrial revitalisation will also support further indirect jobs in fact businesses of all kinds stand to benefit  the increased spending by workers also could support further jobs across businesses ranging from cafes to professional services these indirect jobs go on to induce further employment and spending out across more of the economy overall the report suggests an annual average of more than 7000 indirect and around 10800 induced jobs could be supported during the construction phase with 452 million in indirect and 581 million in induced value added to the wider economy annually on average however transformation is costly and today the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk this has contributed to a pronounced skills gap in the region as opportunities decline and more people fall out of the workforce bridging the skills gap in the humber projects such as zch depend on availability of skilled workforces to build and operate the next generation of energy technologies however the humber currently has a low proportion of school leavers with the right qualifications to take on roles with specialist technical and practical skills this skills gap is only expected to get worse the governments working futures model forecasts that from 2022 key sectors such as electricity and gas engineering and construction in the region will require higher qualifications than are currently available in the local labour market the skills gap is also compounded by covid19 as it creates economic uncertainty it pushes more people out of work and further reduces skills in the workforce this has a particularly pronounced impact on young people who are less established in careers threatening to create a covidgeneration that feel discouraged and detached from the labour market but this is not an inevitability with the right intervention from government and business the humbers workforce can be upskilled and drive a green recovery a number of different approaches are possible apprenticeships have historically proved a valuable means of training the next generation of workers companies and schools should work together to highlight the opportunities of vocational training to school leavers  universities and colleges must work a lot more closely with the businesses in the region to have an honest conversation about what they need explains hart a good example is the ron dearing university technical college its a businessled college that has only been open about 18 months but has had great results from the students because they offer specific courses that the regions employers actually need for older generations of workers who have been out of the labour force for extended periods of time skills vouchers are a timely intervention these work by offering grants to cover the cost of flexibly retraining meaning longterm unemployed workers of any age can ease back into new types of jobs training local people for the future is key to decarbonising the humber and creating jobs as well as protecting industries but a net zero industrial cluster could also have an impact beyond just the humber carbon removal in yorkshire and the humber the committee on climate change ccc has made it clear that for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 ccus and negative emissions from beccs are essential  as is hydrogen as a zerocarbon source of fuel these will be needed at scale across the uk and in the humber they are already underway engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station drax power station is piloting beccs technology and has proven it can deliver negative emissions generating electricity using biomass from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 is a carbon neutral process as part of the power generation process adding ccus and capturing the co 2 emitted storing it permanently under the north sea turns the process into a carbon negative one deploying beccs across four of draxs generating units would support 10304 jobs and create 673 million in value at the peak of the construction phase when operations get underway as early as 2027 750 permanent operations and maintenance jobs could be created drax aims to operate as a carbon negative power station by 2030  of the 10491 jobs supported by deploying beccs 10300 at the peak 6367 of these would be within the projects supply chain and wider economy 9073 in 2028 such supply chains needed across the north of england offer further potential to establish yorkshire and the humber as a hub for decarbonisation technology facilities such as an advanced manufacturing research centre amrc have been proven to make regions of the uk more competitive locations for advanced industries by bringing together business with universities they can focus on sectorspecific challenges for technical industries by creating a manufacturing hub dedicated to research and innovation in a specific industry amrcs also encourage crowingin investments this is when private sectors investments enter into a region in the wake of government spending a zero carbon technologyfocused amrc in the humber would also position the region to offer decarbonisation skills and products to other industrial clusters in the uk and further afield from the humber to the world up the north coast from the humber is net zero teesside a neighbouring industrial cluster with its own aims for decarbonisation through collaboration with clusters such as this zch can offer even wider reaching benefits and enable ukwide carbon capture negative emissions and hydrogen however for the entire uk to reach net zero clusters all across the country must decarbonise  the report suggests as much as 190 million tonnes mt co 2 could be captured and stored every year across the country beyond just the clusters themselves 193000 jobs could be created at the peak for uk deployment in 2039 these jobs would add 139 billion in value to the economy building a strong zero carbon economy based around the combined strengths of beccs ccus and hydrogen can provide the uk with a worldleading export at a time when countries across the globe all face the same decarbonisation challenges successfully building clusters like zch will allow the uk to export knowledge skilled labour technology and services around the world as a port city hull has always had an international influence the chamber of commerce was set up in 1837 by the merchant adventurers who were seafaring traders that history is inbuilt into the local dna says wade today were trying to create the environment for international companies to invest and locate in the humber it serves as a further example of how investing decisively in projects such as carbon capture by drax and ccus and hydrogen clusters such as zero carbon humber today will bring long term economic benefits taking the uk from a green recovery to a worldleading green industrial powerhouse the humber has evolved from the fishing industry to a generator of highemissions products like steel chemicals and power explains hart now it is keen to be the clean corner and teach everyone else how to decarbonise there is a single vision of where we want to go and how they want to get there jointly read the full report pdf  executive summary and press release  share
