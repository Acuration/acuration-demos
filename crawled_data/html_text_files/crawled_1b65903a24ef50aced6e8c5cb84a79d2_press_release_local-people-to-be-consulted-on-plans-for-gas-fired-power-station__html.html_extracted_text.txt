Local people to be consulted on plans for gas-fired power station
Abergelli Power Limited is proposing to build a rapid response gas power station on land at Abergellli Farm, south of Felindre and to the north of the M4.
2 January 2018
The proposed Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) power station would produce up to 299 MW of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of about 150,000 homes.
It is intended to be able to be up and running quickly to provide back-up power to the National Grid during periods of peak demand, to support the growing number of renewable and low carbon energy sources.
As a rapid response and flexible power station it would not be operational all the time – it would be producing power for up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in a given year.
The development will contribute millions of pounds of investment into the local economy, create up to 15 full time skilled jobs once operational, and up to 150 jobs during the two-year construction period.
Local people were originally consulted on proposals for the power station in 2014, but the project was put on hold in 2015 due to market uncertainty. The project is now under the new ownership of the British energy company, Drax Group plc, and is once again being taken forward.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said: “As a result of what was learned during the consultation undertaken in 2014 and other studies, we have made a number of changes to the original proposals. For example, the cable for the electrical connection has been put underground instead of having an overhead line; we have selected an access route from the B4489 to the west of the site, and reduced the number of stacks from five to one.
“We are looking forward to sharing our latest plans at the public exhibitions next month and hearing what local people think about them before we finalise the scheme and submit a Development Consent Order application.”
Abergelli Power Limited is holding public consultation events from 7 February 2018 to 10 February 2018 at Lllangyfelach, Clydach, Tircoed and Felindre. Members of the project team will be on hand to discuss the proposals and consultation process.
The consultation will run from 16 January 2018 until 19 February 2018 and full information about the project, the public exhibitions and the preliminary findings of the environmental impact assessments will be available online on Abergelli Power
here
.
As the capacity of the power station is over 50 MW, the scheme is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, which means a Development Consent Order application will need to be submitted to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, who will make a decision on whether to give the plans the go ahead.
Subject to the public consultation, planning process and market conditions, the power station could be operational in 2022.
