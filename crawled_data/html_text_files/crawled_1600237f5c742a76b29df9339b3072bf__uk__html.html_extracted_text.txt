UK’s largest renewable power station lights up for Poppy Appeal
10 November 2023
Press releases

Drax Power Station, which is located near Selby in North Yorkshire, will project a poppy onto one of its 114-metre-tall cooling towers in a unique act of remembrance. The projection will be illuminated onto the site on Armistice Day (November 11) and Remembrance Sunday (November 12) between 6pm and midnight.
This year marks the fourth time that Drax has paid tribute in this manner. Members of the public can safely view the display from the Drax Sports and Social Club parking area, which is situated opposite the power station.
Bruce Heppenstall, Plant Director at Drax, said:
“Drax has supported the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal for many years, and this projection is a heartfelt tribute to the enduring sacrifices made by generations of armed forces personnel.
“We have many veterans working at Drax, and I know this weekend is a particularly poignant one for them. This is not only a moment to remember those sadly no longer with us, but also an opportunity to help those who have served in the armed forces and are transitioning to civilian life today. That is why we are so proud to support the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal as all the money raised goes to providing financial, social, and emotional support to veterans and their families.”
One of the veterans who now work at the power station is Holly Clough, who served for over four years in the Royal Air Force as a driver and three years as a civilian with the NAAFI. Her roles in the RAF included helping to transport the iconic Vulcan bomber aircraft.
Holly, and a dedicated team of around 50 veterans at Drax Power Station, help organise the plant’s annual Poppy Appeal. She said
: “The work that the Royal British Legion does is essential in helping smooth the difficult transition to civilian life for veterans.
“It is wonderful that Drax is again supporting the annual Poppy Appeal and I know that the money raised will go a long way for veterans and their families.”

This Halloween celebration wasn’t just about thrills, but also helping local animals who call the site and nearby area home. The on-site café raised funds for the local swan and wildlife hospital during the events, with more than £522.00 being donated.
Jane Breach, UK Community and Education Manager at Drax, said
“We were thrilled to welcome more than 600 people to the Skylark Centre to entertain and educate young people during Halloween. Drax is committed to building a strong and positive community connection in the areas that we operate in the UK and around the world. We hope we’ve inspired families to reconnect with nature and get outdoors more often and enjoy the incredible sights we have on our own doorsteps.”
Established by Drax in the early 1970s, Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve now houses a variety of wildlife and serves as an important educational resource for schools, colleges, and local nature organisations.

Drax and Glasgow Science Centre join forces to deliver innovative hydropower programmes for schools
26 October 2023
Press releases

Drax Foundation and Glasgow Science Centre have worked together to develop the bespoke programmes that will support schoolchildren to build their STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills and inspire them to consider careers in hydropower.
The hydropower sector in Scotland is growing, with plans being developed to expand pumped storage hydro stations including Drax’s Cruachan plant, and it is set to remain a long-term source for careers in renewable energy.
Sarah Cameron, Community Manager for Scotland at Drax Group, said:
“We are proud to support Glasgow Science Centre and the work they are doing to develop STEM skills among young Scottish people. The learning lab and workshop are pioneering hydropower education programmes that will help students develop their STEM knowledge and hopefully get excited and interested in a career in hydropower.
“We are committed to giving back to our communities, it’s important to us to help children develop the skills, particularly in STEM, that can help solve challenges like climate change and develop and deploy technologies which can further decarbonise our energy system.”
The primary schools programme is run through Glasgow Science Centre’s ‘
Learning Lab
’ and lasts between four to six weeks. It uses case studies of Drax’s Scottish assets to teach children how different forms of hydropower operate, this includes pumped hydro and run of river plants. It also includes a visit for participating classes to Glasgow Science Centre or a visit to their school from the science centre’s On Tour team.
Students in secondary schools can participate through
STEM Futures Work Readiness Workshops
. These workshops are for fifth and sixth year pupils and are delivered on site at Glasgow Science Centre. In the training, young people work together to explore the careers available in hydropower in Scotland as well as the skills they would need to develop to access them.

Dr Stuart Meiklejohn, STEM Futures Project Coordinator, at Glasgow Science Centre, said:
“This exciting new partnership will deliver invaluable hydro-themed education resources and is the first of its kind in Scotland. Using Glasgow Science Centre’s innovative Learning Lab approach, we will help pupils learn about the importance of, and science involved in, hydro energy in their everyday lives.
“The engaging programmes encompass teacher training to build classroom confidence and hydropower content designed for primary pupils in Scotland, along with opportunities to hear from experts working in the sector. Older pupils will also be able to learn how they can pursue their lifelong relationship with STEM as they are thinking about their future careers.
“We are excited to be working with Drax and look forward to the amazing impact this work will have on the students of Scotland.”
The programmes are fully funded by Drax and there are resources available for 50 primary schools to participate in the Learning Labs as well as 20 workshops for up to 400 secondary school pupils.  Schools can apply for the programmes, which will launch in early 2024, by contacting Glasgow Science Centre via their website:
glasgowsciencecentre.org
.
The launch of the programmes follow on from Drax’s corporate foundation, Drax Foundation’s, recent funding of EDI bursaries with EngineeringUK which will help support underrepresented young people into engineering careers.  The Foundation is a key part of Drax’s community strategy, which is focused on ensuring that the business delivers a positive impact in the communities where it operates.
Alongside these new programmes Drax offers free educational tours for schools of its Cruachan site in Argyll and Bute. These tours offer insights into what a career in engineering involves, how pumped storage hydro works and how Cruachan supports meeting Net Zero targets. For more information on tours and their availability schools can contact the Cruachan Visitor Centre via:

Offshore wind shortfall risks higher power prices and carbon emissions
24 October 2023
Press releases

The latest UK offshore wind auction failed to procure new power, leaving a key climate target at risk
Plugging this new gap could mean an additional 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and a more than 20% rise in wholesale electricity prices
Imperial College academics warn the country is too reliant on a single technology and that the CfD system may have to become more flexible in the future
New analysis by academics at Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights reveals that the UK’s stalled offshore wind developments jeopardises its climate targets, potentially leading to substantially higher power prices and increased carbon emissions.
Rising inflation left the auction unable to deliver new offshore wind projects as the upper limit set for prices through the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme was now too low. The Government had hoped to secure up to 5 GW of power at the auction to help meet its target to install 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030.
In a special report on the fallout from the auction, Drax Electric Insights estimates that the impact of this auction could be felt into the future and later this decade the country runs the risk of an annual shortfall of 26 TWh electricity generation. This gap will most likely be filled by increased reliance on gas and imports from abroad, leading to an additional 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and a more than 20% rise in wholesale electricity prices.
The report’s authors suggest the current framework’s dependence on wind means it is “relying too heavily on a single technology to support the decarbonisation of the UK’s electricity system,” and proposes “taking a more balanced approach that distributes the share of heavy lifting done by different low carbon technologies would be more effective.”
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report series, said:
“The UK’s decarbonisation strategy is focused heavily on offshore wind, but the auction shows the danger of putting all your eggs in the one basket. The UK has to triple its offshore wind capacity in just seven years to meet the government’s target. With the auction delivering no new capacity, there’s now a huge shortfall and the goal is looking increasingly unattainable.
“This auction should serve as a wake-up call for both government and industry. It may be time to re-evaluate the CfD design to ensure it continues to incentivise not only new projects, but also generation once they are operational. We need to ensure investment is going into a range of low carbon technologies to share the load of decarbonisation.”
Other low carbon or renewable technologies which have been gaining interest from industry and government in recent years include small nuclear modular reactors, long-duration energy storage and carbon capture.
Drax was the first energy company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 through utilising Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology. The company has radically decarbonised its business by transforming its largest power plant – Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire – to use biomass to generate renewable electricity instead of coal.
The company plans to deploy BECCS technology at its UK plant this decade, permanently capturing and removing up to 8 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year – more than enough to cover the additional emissions created from the offshore wind auction’s failure.
Penny Small, Drax’s Group Generation Director, said:
“The UK cannot reach net zero without deploying carbon capture and storage technologies at scale. That’s why we are progressing plans to deploy BECCS at Drax Power Station so we can capture and permanently remove up to 8 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.
“In addition to removing carbon from the atmosphere, BECCS simultaneously provides the country with reliable, renewable electricity. We are engaged in formal discussions with the Government about the project and, providing these are successful, we plan to invest billions in delivering BECCS in the UK.”

Accelerating the development of CCS clusters could deliver an extra £32BN for the UK economy per year from 2050
19 October 2023
Press releases

New research shows that cluster development could be worth hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of pounds in GVA to the UK’s economy by 2050.
With over 80% of the UK’s licensed storage in the North Sea, the majority of these economic benefits could go to the North of England and create an additional 330,000 jobs.
If the UK fails to deliver on its CCS rollout 136,000 jobs could be at risk.
A new independent research report, UK Cluster potential – how the UK can lead the world in Carbon Capture and Storage, by Development Economics, finds that if the UK Government accelerates and expands the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Clusters across the country it could generate an extra £32bn of gross value added (GVA) for the economy from 2050 onward and nearly 500,000 additional jobs.
The research, commissioned by Drax Group, demonstrates that in the most optimistic scenario the UK Government could enhance our energy security, turbo-charge economic growth across the country and cement the UK’s position as a world-leader in carbon capture and removals technology.
It states that this scenario could be delivered through policy changes which can unlock investment and clarify how CCS Clusters are developed. These include:
Finalising CCS business and financial models;
Confirming the role of the UK ETS scheme and voluntary carbon markets in supporting investment in CCS;
Providing a near-term incentive for prospective storage operators to appraise storage locations building on recent North Sea Transition Authority licencing rounds.
The North of England would be the region to benefit most with £22bn added to the economy per year from 2050 onward and 330,000 additional jobs.
The report also explores the economic impacts of two additional scenarios, one where the UK delivers on current CCS policy commitments and another where it does not.
If the UK does fulfil its ambitions, it will be worth an additional £23bn per year from 2050 and an additional 310,000 jobs.
Richard Gwilliam, UK BECCS Programme Director at Drax Group, said:
“Carbon capture and removals can be a catalyst for growth, stronger energy security, increasing employment and reaching Net Zero in the UK. This research demonstrates that if the UK puts its foot on the accelerator and expands the rollout of CCS Clusters across the country, a unique prize worth tens of billions of pounds to the economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs is within reach.
“At Drax, we want to play our part in ensuring the UK becomes a global leader in CCS and that is why we are working towards installing two bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) units at Drax Power Station. This would see us become a key part of a Humber-based carbon capture cluster and we are currently working on routes to deployment through the Track 1 Expansion and Track 2 processes.”
Steve Lucas, Director at Development Economics, said:
“This research demonstrates the significant opportunity for the UK to be a global leader in carbon capture and storage and the importance of CCS for key industries which provides jobs, growth and opportunity across the UK. With ambition, clarity, and the necessary support from Government – following the key suggestions outlined in the report’s roadmap – there is a significant prize to be won for the UK economy and environment”.
However, in its recent progress report the Climate Change Committee warned that the rollout of CCS is already behind schedule and Development Economics’ research shows that if this trend continues and the UK fails to deliver on its CCS policy commitments, the economic effects could be severe.
This includes the loss of 136,000 jobs and £9bn GVA per year from 2050 from heavy-emitting companies, which will have no other route to decarbonise and therefore could move their operations abroad to countries with better resourced and more CCS clusters.
The report argues that the combination of additional support delivered in the most optimistic scenario, the country’s past hydrocarbon expertise and £15bn from the investment community for the energy transition, would put the UK on the map as a world-leader in CCS.
It also demonstrates that the Humber, with existing plans to become the world’s first carbon negative region and 80% of the UK’s licensed CO
2
storage, could become a global model for regional cluster development. The research shows that with increased ambition the Humber could benefit from an additional 42,000 jobs and £3.4bn GVA per year by 2050.
Drax plans plan to invest billions in its BECCS plans at North Yorkshire’s Drax Power Station to develop two units which could remove 8Mt of carbon from the atmosphere per year while continuing to provide renewable baseload power to the UK grid.
This will ensure the station continues to generate secure renewable electricity into the future while delivering up to 10,000 high-skilled jobs in the Humber at the project’s peak and playing a critical role in delivering carbon removals so the UK can meet its binding engineered greenhouse gas removal target.
Drax is currently exploring the roles the Track-1 Expansion and Track-2 CCS cluster sequencing can play in supporting the transition to BECCS at the Selby site. Power-BECCS remains eligible to participate in either process.
