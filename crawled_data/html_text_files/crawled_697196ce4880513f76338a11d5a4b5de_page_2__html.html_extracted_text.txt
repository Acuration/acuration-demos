The world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
13 April 2021
Opinion

Today we
completed a transformational deal
– our acquisition of Canadian biomass pellet producer Pinnacle Renewable Energy.
I’m very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the Drax family – together we will build on what we have already achieved, having become the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe and the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal.
The deal positions Drax as the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business – making us a truly international business, trading biomass from North America to Europe and Asia. It also advances our strategy to increase our self supply, reduces our biomass production costs and creates a long-term future for sustainable biomass – a renewable energy source that the UN’s IPCC says will be needed to achieve global climate targets.
It’s also an important milestone in Drax’s ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our
pioneering negative emissions technology BECCS
.
That’s because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) at Drax.
Negative emissions from BECCS are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy, supporting jobs and clean growth in a post-Covid recovery.
Inside a Pinnacle pellet mill
We already know Pinnacle well – it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with Drax.
Our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so I’m looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together.
We will benefit from Pinnacle’s scale, operational efficiency and low-cost fibre sourcing, that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues. In 2019, Pinnacle’s production cost was 20% lower than Drax’s.
Completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 4.9 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets
at 17 plants in locations across Western Canada and the US South
– up from 1.6Mt now.
It also expands our access to three major North American fibre baskets and four export facilities, giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base, which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply.
This positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass. The market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in Europe and Asia is expected to grow in the current decade, principally driven by demand in Asia.

We believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets, the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play, will result in continued robust demand.
Pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with C$6.7 billion of long-term contracts with high quality Asian and European customers, including Drax, and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027.
Drax aims to leverage Pinnacle’s trading capability across its expanded portfolio. We believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and third-party suppliers.
The transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics, helping to reduce distance, time, carbon footprint and cost.
Train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at Drax Power Station
Importantly – there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group.
We recognise that the forest landscape in British Columbia and Alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern US where we currently operate.
In line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy, Drax will work closely with environmental groups, Indigenous First Nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental, social and climate outcomes in Pinnacle’s sourcing areas.
We are determined to create a long-term future for sustainable biomass and deliver BECCS –  the negative emissions technology that will be needed around the world to meet global climate targets. The acquisition of Pinnacle takes us a big step forward in achieving our goals.

Standing together
against climate
change
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
27 January 2021
Opinion

Tackling climate change requires global collaboration. As a UK-US sustainable energy company, with communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we at Drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders.
Joe Biden has become the 46
th
President of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change. Starting with re-joining the Paris Agreement, I am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this once-in-a-lifetime challenge.
This is why Drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic
coalition
of negative emissions producers. This can foster collaboration and shared learning between the
different technologies and techniques
for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy.

Whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead, clear long-term policies that spur collaboration, drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the UK and US’ aligned targets of reaching
net zero
carbon emissions by 2050.
Collaboration between countries and industries
What makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects. This is why the Paris Agreement and this year’s COP26 conference in Glasgow are so vital.

Our effort towards
delivering negative emissions
using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (
BECCS
) is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated, collaborative energy system. The technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions, such as the US South where our American communities operate. Carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help Drax to be carbon negative by 2030 – an
ambition I announced at COP25
, just over a year ago in Madrid.
Will Gardiner announcing Drax’s carbon negative ambition at COP25 in Madrid (December 2019).
Our cutting-edge carbon removal technologies will help the UK, and the world, hit net zero.
Experts on both sides of the Atlantic consider BECCS essential for net zero. The UK’s Climate Change Committee says it will play a major role in
tackling carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions that will remain in the UK economy after 2050
, from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise. Meanwhile, a report published last year by New York’s Columbia University revealed that
rapid development of BECCS is needed within the next 10 years
in order to curb climate change.
A variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between
10% and 20% of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon
produced annually that the International Energy Agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
We believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry, bioenergy, and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries, industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies.
A formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management,
afforestation and reforestation
, as well as technical solutions like direct air capture (DAC), as well as BECCS, would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally.
Direct air capture (DAC) facility
It would also offer flexibility in countries’ paths to net zero emissions. If one approach under-delivers, other technologies can work together to compensate and meet CO
2
removal targets.
As with renewable energy,
working in partnership with governments
is essential to develop these innovations into the cost-effective, large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the mid-century.
A shared economic opportunity
I agree whole heartedly that a nation’s economy and environment are intrinsically linked – something many leaders are now saying, including President Biden. The recently approved US economic stimulus bill, supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and which allocates $35 billion for new clean energy initiatives, is a positive step for climate technology and job creation.
Globally as many as
65 million well-paid jobs
could be created through investment in clean energy systems. In the UK, BECCS and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change, but are also a
vital economic force
as the world begins to recover from the effects of COVID-19.
Engineer inside the turbine hall of Drax Power Station
We all want the UK’s recovery to be a green recovery – one which benefits the North, along with the whole of the country
Government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of well-paid jobs, new careers, education opportunities and upskill workforces.
Developing BECCS at Drax Power Station
, for example, would support around 17,000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028, including roles in construction, local supply chains and the wider economy.
Additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain. This includes the rail, shipping and forestry industries
that are integral to rural communities in the US South
.
We are also partnered with 11 other
organisations in the UK’s Humber region
to develop a carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200,000 jobs around the UK in 2039.
The expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared, traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world, allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for CCUS and
biomass sustainability
.
Clear, long-term policies are essential here, not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment. These are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact CO
2
emissions and lives of people.
Engineer at BECCS pilot project within Drax Power Station
At Drax we directly employ almost 3,000 people in the US and UK, and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic. Drax Power Station is the most advanced BECCS project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cutting-edge carbon capture and removal technology. We can then share our expertise with the United States and the rest of the world – a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green economic recovery.

What is renewable energy?
17 December 2020
Sustainable bioenergy

These differ to non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas, of which there is a finite amount available on Earth, meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out.
Renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications, including electricity generation, transportation and heating or cooling.
The difference between low-carbon, carbon neutral and renewable energy
Renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce
any

carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
when they generate power. Low-carbon sources might produce
some
CO
2
, but much less than fuels like coal.
Bioenergy that uses woody biomass
from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb CO
2
from the atmosphere as they grow, meaning the amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere remains level. Supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation. Therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel, when its
whole lifecycle
is considered.
Managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power.
Responsible biomass sourcing
also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuel-based energy generation.
Nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable. It does not produce CO
2,
but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium, of which there is a finite amount available.
Managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power.
How much renewable energy is used around the world?
Humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires, as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing. Water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources, but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels, coal in particular, have been the main source of power.
However, as the effects of air pollution and CO
2
produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent, renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change.
In the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18% of global electricity generation,
according to the IEA
. By 2019, renewable sources made up 27% of the world’s electrical power.
Why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change
The single biggest human contribution to
climate change
is greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO
2,
into the atmosphere. They create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on Earth to increase, making it less habitable.
Renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the world’s demand for power without contributing to global warming, unlike carbon-intensive fuels like coal, gas and oil.
Bioenergy can also be used to
remove CO
2
from the atmosphere
while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Forests absorb CO
2
from the atmosphere, then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same CO
2
is captured and stored permanently underground – reducing the overall amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere.
Humans have used renewable energy for millions for years, from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs.

What’s holding renewables back?
The world’s energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind. This can make
converting national grids difficult
and installing new renewable energy sources expensive. However, as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture, build and operate renewable systems, the cost of deploying them at scale drops.
There are future changes needed. Renewables such as wind, solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they can’t generate electricity when there is no sun, wind or the tidal movement. For future energy systems to deliver enough power, large scale energy storage, as well as other flexible, reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and
keep systems stable
.
Renewable energy key facts:

Renewable power in the UK has
grown six-fold
in the last decade, helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the country’s electricity system by 58%, according to Electric Insights.
The
cost of electricity from solar panels
dropped by 82% between 2010 and 2019, while the cost of onshore wind fell 40% and offshore wind 29%.
The world’s
largest power station of any kind
, the Three Gorges Dam in China, runs on a renewable energy source, hydropower, and has a generation capacity of 22.5 gigawatts (GW).
The
total capacity of the world’s installed renewable electricity
generation is forecast to reach 3,978 GW in 2025, up from 849 GW in 2000.

Committing to a net zero power system as part of COP26
30 November 2020
Carbon capture

Dear Prime Minister, Chancellor, COP26 President and Minister for Energy and Clean Growth,
We are a group of energy companies investing tens of billions in the coming decade, deploying the low carbon infrastructure the UK will need to get to
net zero
and drive a green recovery to the COVID-19 crisis.
We welcome the leadership shown on the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, and the detailed work going on across government to deliver a net zero economy by 2050. We are writing to you to call on the Government to signal what this will mean for UK electricity decarbonisation
by committing to a date for a net zero power system
.
Head of BECCS Carl Clayton inspects pipes at the
CCUS Incubation Area
, Drax Power Station
The electricity sector will be the backbone of our net zero economy, and there will be ever increasing periods where Great Britain is powered by only zero carbon generation. To support this, the Electricity System Operator is putting in place the systems, products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025.
Achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing, which has been central in delivering UK leadership in the move away from coal and has led to UK electricity emissions falling by over 63% between 2012 and 2019 alone.
It is thanks to successive governments’ commitment to robust carbon pricing that the UK is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago – before the birth of the steam locomotive. A consistent, robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment low-carbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in British history in the first quarter of 2020.
Yet, even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind, more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy.
www.drax.com/us/Captureit
In the near-term, in combination with other policies, continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation, market dispatch of upcoming gas-fired generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects and the blending of low carbon hydrogen with gas-fired generation. Further forward, a robust carbon price can incentivise 100% hydrogen use in gas-fired generation, and importantly drive
negative emissions
to facilitate the delivery of a net zero economy.
Next year, the world’s attention will focus on Glasgow and negotiations crucial to achieving our climate change targets, with important commitments already made by China, the EU, Japan and South Korea amongst others. An ambitious 2030 target from the UK will help kickstart
the Sprint to Glasgow
ahead of the
UK-UN Climate Summit
on 12 December.
Electricity cables and pylon snaking around a mountain near
Cruachan Power Station
, Drax’s flexible pumped storage facility in the Highlands
2030 ambition is clearly needed, but to deliver on net zero, deep decarbonisation will be required. Previous commitments from the UK on its
coal phase out
and being the first major economy to adopt a net zero target continue to encourage similar international actions. To build on these and continue UK leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation,
we call on the UK to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of COP26,
to match the commitment of the US President-elect’s
Clean Energy Plan
. To ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost, the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input.
Alongside near-term stability as the UK’s carbon pricing future is determined, to meet this commitment
Government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the Budget next year, with a target date to be confirmed in the UK’s upcoming Net Zero Strategy.
This commitment would send a signal to the rest of the world that the UK intends to maintain its leadership position on climate and to build a greener, more resilient economy.

COP26: Will countries with the boldest climate policies reach their targets?
30 October 2020
Carbon capture

To tackle the climate crisis, global unity and collaboration are needed. This was in part the thinking behind the Paris Agreement. It set a clear, collective target negotiated at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and signed the following year: to keep the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
In November 2021,
COP26
will see many of the countries who first signed the Paris Agreement come together in Glasgow for the first ‘global stocktake’ of their environmental progress since its creation.
COP26 will take place at the SEC in Glasgow
Already delayed for a year as a result of the pandemic, COVID-19 and its effects on emissions is likely to be a key talking point. So too will progress towards not just the Paris Agreement goals but those of individual countries. Known as ‘National Determined Contributions’ (NDCs), these sit under the umbrella of the Paris Agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries.
With many countries still reeling from the effects of COVID-19, the question is: which countries are actually on track to meet them?
What are the goals?
The NDCs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. These incorporate various targets, from
decarbonisation
and
forestry
to coastal preservation and financial aims.
While all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the Paris Agreement targets, not all have an equally sized task. The principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions, capabilities and economic conditions.
The
Universal Ecological Fund
outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters, showing that combined, they account for 56% of global greenhouse gas emissions. China is the largest emitter, responsible for 26.8%, followed by the US which contributes 13.1%. The European Union and its 28 member states account for nine per cent, while India is responsible for seven per cent of all emissions.
These nations have ambitious emissions goals, but are they on track to meet them?
China
Traffic jams in the rush hour in Shanghai Downtown, contribute to high emissions in China.
By 2030, China pledged to reach peak
carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
, increase its non-fossil fuel share of energy supply to 20% and reduce the carbon intensity – the ratio between emissions of CO
2
to the output of the economy – by 60% to 65% below 2005 levels.
COVID-19 has increased the uncertainty of the course of China’s emissions.
Some projections
show that emissions are likely to grow in the short term, before peaking and levelling out sometime between 2021 and 2025. However, according to the
Climate Action Tracker
it is also possible that China’s emissions have already peaked – specifically in 2019. China is expected to meet its non-fossil energy supply and carbon intensity pledges.
United States
The forecast for the second largest emitter, the US, has also been affected by the pandemic. Economic firm
Rhodium Group
has predicted that the US could see its emissions drop between 20% and 27% by 2025, meeting its target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels.
However, President Trump’s rolling back of Obama-era climate policies and regulations, his support of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (effective from as early as 4 November 2020), suggest any achievement may not be long-lasting.
The United States’ Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, does not include any direct support to clean energy development – something that could also change in 2021.
European Union
Carl Clayton, Head of BECCS at Drax, inspects pipework in the CCUS area of Drax Power Station
The European Union and its member states, then including the UK, pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 – a target the
Climate Action Tracker
estimates will be achieved. In fact, the EU is on track to cut emissions by 58% by 2030.
This progress is in part a result of a
large package of measures
adopted in 2018. These accelerated the emissions reductions, including national coal phase-out plans, increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency. The package also introduced legally binding annual emission limits for each member state within which they can set individual targets to meet the common goal.
The UK has not yet released an updated, independent NDC. However, it has announced a
£350 million package designed to cut emissions in heavy industry
and drive economic recovery from COVID-19. This includes £139 million earmarked to scale up hydrogen production, as well as
carbon capture and storage (CCS)
technology, such as bioenergy with carbon capture (BECCS) – essential technologies in achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and
protecting industrial regions
.
India
India, the fourth largest global emitter, is set to meet its pledge to reduce its emissions intensity by 33% to 35% below 2005 levels and increase the non-fossil share of power generation to 40% by 2030. What’s more,
the Central Electricity Agency
has reported that 64% of India’s power could come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.
Wind turbines in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India
Along with increasingly renewable generation, the implementation of India’s National Smart Grid Mission aims to modernise and improve the efficiency of the country’s energy system.
It is promising that the world’s four largest emitters have plans in place and are making progress towards their decarbonisation goals. However, tackling
climate change
requires action from around the entire globe. In addition to NDCs, many countries have committed to, or have submitted statements of intent, to
achieve net zero carbon emissions in the coming years

What is carbon dioxide?
18 September 2020
Carbon capture

What is CO
2
?
Carbon dioxide (or CO
2
) is a colourless and odourless naturally occurring gas in the earth’s atmosphere which is made up of
one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms
.  As a greenhouse gas (GHG), it traps heat, making sure the planet isn’t uninhabitably cold. However, fast rising levels of CO
2
and other long-lasting GHGs in the atmosphere are currently causing global warming to occur at an alarmingly rapid rate.
What is the carbon cycle?
Carbon is the basis of all life on earth – it is a key ingredient in almost everything on the planet. As the earth has a closed atmosphere, there has always been the same amount of carbon on the earth, but it is in a constant state of change, transitioning from gas to solid to liquid and moving between the atmosphere and the earth. This process is called the
carbon cycle
, and it is key to ensuring the earth is capable of sustaining life. CO
2
forms one part of this process and makes up the largest available source of carbon on earth.
How is CO
2
made?
Carbon is stored in oceans, soil, and living things and is released from this storage into the atmosphere in the form of CO
2
. CO
2
is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms, which join together through a number of processes, including the decay of organic matter, the combustion of materials such as wood, coal and natural gas, through the breathing of humans and animals, and from events such as volcanic eruptions.
How does CO
2
affect the planet?
An abundance of CO
2
in the earth’s atmosphere means more heat gets trapped, which in turn contributes to a rise in global temperatures and
climate change
. This acceleration in carbon entering the atmosphere began during the Industrial Revolution around the 1800s, when fossil fuels were mined and burned to create energy, which released long-stored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of CO
2
.
From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution until today, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million, to 387 parts per million, which constitutes a
39% increase
. Today, CO
2
levels are the
highest they’ve been in 800,000 years
.
CO
2
is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms, which join together when organic materials containing carbon are burned: wood, coal, and natural gas.
How can countries reduce CO
2
in the atmosphere?
According to the
Paris Climate Agreement
, nations must work to limit warming of the globe to be well under two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In the first half of 2015, the earth registered a one degree Celsius rise in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels, which means drastic and meaningful action must be taken to
decarbonise
within the next few years.
There are many ways to reduce the earth’s carbon footprint, including reforestation and using
alternative ways
to generate energy that don’t rely on fossil fuels. For example,
wind
,
solar
,
biomass
and
hydro
can all provide sustainable, carbon-neutral and low carbon sources of electricity.
Technology such as
carbon capture and storage
(CCS) can capture carbon permanently storing CO
2
from industries in which some CO
2
emissions remain. By combining
CCUS with biomass
energy (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS) it is even possible to generate negative emissions, where
more CO
2
is removed from the atmosphere than is emitted
.
CO
2
fast facts
In the 1960s, the growth of CO
2
occurred at
0.6 parts per million
per year. In the last 10 years,
the rate has been
2.3 parts per million
per year
The average human breathes out
93 kilograms
of CO
2
per year – however, our breathing only contributes
0.65 billion tonnes
of carbon returned to the atmosphere, which is
0.01%
of the amount released by fossil fuels each year
Trees absorb CO
2
in the atmosphere and release it in the form of oxygen, making them vitally important in the world’s fight against climate change. In the US alone,
forests absorb
13%
of the nation’s carbon output
There are many ways to reduce the earth’s carbon footprint, including using alternative ways to generate power.

Negative emissions


How to count carbon emissions
Iain Staffell, Imperial College London
31 August 2020
Opinion

Reduced demand, boosted renewables, and the near-total abandonment of coal pushed last quarter’s carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes.
Emissions are at their lowest in modern times, having fallen by three-quarters compared to the same period ten years ago.  The average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kWh of electricity consumed over the quarter.
The carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just
18 g/kWh in the middle of the Spring Bank Holiday
.  Clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix.
Together, nuclear and renewables produced 90% of Britain’s electricity, leaving just 2.8 GW to come from fossil fuels.
The generation mix over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, highlighting the mix on the Sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record
National Grid and other grid-monitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 g/kWh at that time.  That was still a record low, but very different from the Electric Insights numbers.  So why the discrepancy?
These sites report the carbon intensity of
electricity generation
, as opposed to
consumption
.  Not all the electricity we consume is generated in Britain, and not all the electricity generated in Britain is consumed here.
Should the emissions from power stations in the Netherlands ‘count’ towards our carbon footprint, if they are generating power consumed in our homes?  Earth’s atmosphere would say yes, as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities, CO
2
has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced.
On that Bank Holiday afternoon, Britain was importing 2 GW of electricity from France and Belgium, which are mostly powered by low-carbon nuclear.  We were exporting three-quarters of this (1.5 GW) to the Netherlands and Ireland.  While they do have sizeable shares of renewables, they also rely on coal power.
Britain’s exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt, whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources.  So, the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders.  We estimate that 1190 tonnes of CO
2
were produced here, 165 were emitted in producing our imports, and 730 avoided through our exports.
In the long-term it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used, as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out.  Over the whole quarter, carbon emissions would be 153g/kWh with our measure, or 151 g/kWh with production-based accounting.  But, it does matter on the hourly timescale, consumption based accounting swings more widely.
Imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24
th
, but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 g/kWh.
When renewable output is high in Britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it, and this helps to clean their power systems.  When renewables are low, Britain will import if power from Ireland and the continent is lower cost, but it may well be higher carbon.
Two measures for the carbon intensity of British electricity over the Bank Holiday weekend and surrounding days
This speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy.
Should we use production or consumption based accounting?  With production
(by far the most common measure)
, the UK is doing very well, and overall emissions are down 32% so far this century.  With consumption-based accounting it’s a very different story, and they’re only down 13%
*
.
This is because we import more from abroad, everything from manufactured goods to food, to data when streaming music and films online.
Either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions.  On the one hand
(production-based accounting)
, Britain could be producing 100% clean power, but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand – that should not be classed as zero carbon as it’s pushing the problem elsewhere.  On the other hand
(consumption-based accounting)
, it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running.  If we got to 96% low carbon (1300 MW of gas running), we would be down at 25 g/kWh.  Then if we imported fully from France and sent it to the Netherlands and Ireland, we’d get down to 0 g/kWh.
Regardless of how you measure carbon intensity, it is important to recognise that Britain’s electricity is cleaner than ever.
The hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception, by continuing to expand renewable generation, preparing the grid for their integration, and introducing
negative emissions technologies
such as BECCS (
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
).

What are negative emissions?
21 August 2020
Carbon capture

What are negative emissions?
In order to meet the long-term climate goals laid out in the Paris Agreement, there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air, but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide (CO
2
) currently in the atmosphere, and the CO
2
that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise.
The process of greenhouse gas removal (GGR) or CO
2
removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is possible through
negative emissions
, where more CO
2
is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere. Negative emissions can be achieved through a range of nature-based solutions or through man-made technologies designed to remove CO
2
at scale.
What nature-based solutions exist to remove
CO
2
from the atmosphere?
One millennia-old way of achieving negative emissions is
forests
. Trees absorb carbon when they grow, either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen, or storing it over their lifetime. This makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere.
Planting new forests
and
regenerating forests
has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result.
However, this can also go beyond forests on land. Vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store CO
2
, and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much
carbon as forests on land
– an approach to negative emissions called ‘blue carbon’.

Did you know?
Bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world
– its thick forests absorb three times the amount of CO
2
the small country emits.
What man-made technologies can deliver negative emissions?
Many scientists and experts
agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
(BECCS). This approach uses biomass – sourced from sustainably managed forests – to generate electricity. As the forests used to create biomass absorb CO
2
while growing, the CO
2
released when it is used as fuel is
already accounted for
, making the whole process low carbon.
By then capturing and storing any CO
2
emitted (often in safe underground deposits),
the process of electricity generation
becomes
carbon negative
, as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added.
Direct air carbon capture
and storage (DACCS) is an alternative technological solution in which CO
2
is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used. While this could hold huge potential, the technology is currently in its infancy, and
requires substantial investment
to make it a more widespread practice.
The process of removing CO
2
from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions, because more CO
2
is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it.
How much negative emissions are needed?
According to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
, negative emissions technologies could be required to capture
20 billion tonnes
of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050.
Negative emissions fast facts
Humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere (the crust of the earth) to the biosphere (where we live) at
100
times the rate of the natural carbon cycle
There is enough sustainable biomass available to the UK to support BECCS to remove
51 megatonnes of CO
2
every year by 2050, according to the Committee on Climate Change

What is carbon capture usage and storage?
Carbon capture

What is carbon capture usage and storage?
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a large-scale source – for example, a
power station
or factory – and then permanently storing them.
Carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) is where captured carbon dioxide (CO
2
) may be used, rather than stored, in other industrial processes or even in the
manufacture of consumer products
.
How is carbon captured?
Carbon can be captured either
pre-combustion
, where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used, or
post-combustion
, where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned.
Pre-combustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being
converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide
under heat pressure. The separated CO
2
is
captured and transported to be stored or used.
Post-combustion carbon capture
uses the addition of other materials (such as solvents) to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned. The isolated carbon is then transported (normally via pipeline) to be stored permanently –  usually deep underground – or used for other purposes.
Carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that CO
2
is not released into the atmosphere.

What can the carbon be used for?
Once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways. For example, material including
carbon nanofibres and bioplastics
can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles, while
several start-ups
are developing methods of turning captured CO
2
into animal feed.
Captured carbon can even
assist in the large-scale production of hydrogen
, which could be used as a carbon-neutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation.
Where can carbon be stored?
Carbon can be stored in geological reserves
, commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, or ‘unmineable’ coal beds. The process of storage is referred to as sequestration.
The underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through
mineral storage
, where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new, solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored.
Carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage.
According to the Global CCS Institute
, over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the USA, Norway and Brazil.

What are the benefits of carbon storage?
CO
2
is a greenhouse gas, which traps heat in our atmosphere, and therefore contributes to global warming. By capturing and storing carbon, it is being taken out of the atmosphere, which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change.
