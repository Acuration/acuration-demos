consultation on a proposed gasfired power plant on land at abergelli farm near to the national grid gas compressor station at felindre begins this month october 2014 10 october 2014 abergelli power limited apl an energy development company established by watt power limited will be consulting on the 200m proposal between 13 october 2014 and 16 november 2014 the proposed project would produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity and represent a significant multi million pound investment into the local economy it could support up to 150 jobs during the 23 year construction and commissioning period and up to 15 fulltime jobs when operational the modern gasfired plant would have low emissions and would help strengthen and secure the uks energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from renewable sources  primarily wind and solar it would be designed to operate flexibly ie not always running and permitted to produce electricity for no more than 1500 hours per year as the plant will produce more than 50mw of electricity it is classified as a nationally significant infrastructure project this means that a development consent order is required to build operate and maintain it an application for a development consent order will be submitted to the planning inspectorate with a final decision taken by the secretary of state for energy and climate change the proposal was first presented to the local community during nonstatutory public exhibitions in june this year and statutory consultation will show how the project has developed since then apl has taken into account initial community feedback alongside ongoing engagement with city  county of swansea ccs and authorities such as natural resources wales and the companys own technical and environmental studies the consultation period will now give members of the local community the opportunity to learn more about comment on and potentially influence the proposals before an application for a development consent order is submitted apl has produced a statement of community consultation detailing the consultation programme it includes a number of exhibition events which will be an opportunity for local people and interested organisations to see the plans and give their views on the proposals ccs has been consulted on the consultation programme the exhibitions will be held on

project team will be on hand at these events to explain the proposed project how to get involved in the consultation process and to answer any questions the community may have preliminary assessments of the likely significant environmental effects of the project will also be available for viewing apls project director norman campbell said consultation with local communities and organisations is vitally important to us it provides us with an opportunity to explain our project in detail and get feedback to help with the development of our proposals our initial phase of consultation in june gave us the chance to communicate directly with local people gather their views and address their concerns we will now explain how the project has moved forward in recent months and provide more detailed information one of the key changes we have made is to reduce the height of the stacks of the plant following community feedback and our technical and environmental work we can confirm that they will be no taller than 40 metres this decision is just one of the steps we have taken to minimise the environmental and visual impact of the project we are also looking for peoples views on the environmental work we have carried out to date the proposed route options for accessing the project and our proposed layout of the plant within the project site we hope that as many people as possible will attend our public exhibition days or see the information we have made available on the project website and deposited at local libraries we will advertise the formal consultation in local media and are also distributing more than 13000 leaflets to homes and businesses in the area in the vicinity of the site at the end of the consultation period apl will finalise its proposals before submitting an application for a development consent order subject to the consultation and planning process and financing the power plant could enter commercial operation in 20192020 for further
