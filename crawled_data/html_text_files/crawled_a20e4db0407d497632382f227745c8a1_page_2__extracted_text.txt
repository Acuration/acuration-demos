sustainability forests net zero and the science behind biomass 22 december 2021 sustainable bioenergy tackling climate change and spurring a global transition to net zero emissions will require collaboration between science and industry new technologies and decarbonisation methods must be rooted in scientific research and testing drax has almost a decade of experience in using biomass as a renewable source of power  over that time our understanding around the effectiveness of bioenergy its role in improving forest health and ability to deliver negative emissions has accelerated research from governments and global organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergys role in achieving net zero on a wide scale the european commission has also highlighted biomass potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy sustainably managed forests frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission in charge of the european green deal has emphasised its importance in bringing economies to net zero saying without biomass were not going to make it we need biomass in the mix but the right biomass in the mix the role of biomass in a sustainable future moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables supporting wind and solar by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels will require flexible sources of generation such as biomass as well as other technologies like increased energy storage  in the uk the climate change committees ccc sixth carbon budget report lays out its balanced net zero pathway in this lead scenario the ccc says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of co 2 or equivalent emissions mtco 2 e per year by 2035 increasing to 25 mtco2e in 2045 foresters in working forest mississippi biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity such as aviation shipping and industrial processes the cccs balanced net zero pathway suggest that enough lowcarbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 twh of nonelectric power in 2050  compared to the 1000 twh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today however bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks a report coauthored by ipcc experts examines the scientific literature around the climate effects principally co 2 abatement of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices the report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products including biomass that replace greenhouse gas ghgintensive fossil fuels and by storing carbon in forests and in longlived forest products the role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels the addition of carbon capture and storage ccs to bioenergy to create bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently the negative emissions made possible by beccs are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels beccs and the path to net zero the ipccs special report on limiting global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy  coupled with effective landuse that prevents it contributing to deforestation the second chapter of the report deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the midcentury bioenergy use is substantial in 15c pathways with or without ccs due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels however its the negative emissions made possible by beccs that make biomass instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios the ipcc report highlights beccs alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation ar that comes with sustainable forest management are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 15 o c graphic showing how beccs removes carbon from the atmosphere click to viewdownload there are two key factors that make beccs and other forms of emissions removals so essential the first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hardtoabate emissions negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of co 2 that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero the second reason beccs and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic co 2 emissions what makes co 2 such an important ghg to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other to help reach the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to below 15 o c removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential in the uk the cccs 2018 report  biomass in a lowcarbon economy  also points to beccs as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement it suggests that power generation from beccs will increase from 3 twh per year in 2035 to 45 twh per year in 2050 it marks a sharp increase from the 195 twh that biomass without ccs accounted for across 2020 according to electric insights data it also suggests that beccs could sequester 11 tonnes of co 2 for every tonne of biomass used providing clear negative emissions however the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and beccs is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that as a minimum requirement maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time with increased attention paid to forest management and land use there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a winwin solution that can decarbonise power and economies while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester co 2  how bioenergy ensures sustainable forests biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable climate beneficial or low carbon source of power uk legislation on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its longterm capacity to produce wood this is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from landuse changes such as urban creep where vegetated land is converted into urban concreted spaces depends on a healthy market for wood products industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higherquality wood while lowquality waste wood as well as residues from forests and woodindustry byproducts can be bought and used to produce biomass pellets  a report by forest 2 market examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the us south where drax sources about twothirds of its biomass the report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the us south instead it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the regions forests a synthesis report  which examines a broad range of research papers published in forest ecology and management in march of 2021 concluded from existing studies that claims of largescale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the south east us are not supported the use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net ghg greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels according to forest research  importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing in fact the opposite is true with annual wood growth in the us south increasing by 112 between 1953 and 2015  delivering a winwin solution the european commissions jrc science for policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report  the use of woody biomass for energy production in the eu suggests a winwin forest bioenergy pathway is possible that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term while at the same time not damaging or even improving the condition of forest ecosystems however it also makes clear loselose situations is also a possible in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policyrelevant timeframes winwin management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity a winwin future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse naturally regenerated and dedicated industrial forests the report also warns of tradeoffs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions or vice versa these must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a loselose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations while beccs fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions in a future that will depend on science working in collaboration with industries to build a net zero future continued research is key to ensuring biomass can deliver the winwin solution of renewable electricity with negative emissions while supporting healthy forests tags biomass energy  sustainability  technology  forests  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  forestry and forest

environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the paris agreement one of those components is the right workforce large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a lowcarbon future in 2020 the renewable energy sector employed 115 million people around the world but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow last year a national grid report found that in the uk alone 120000 jobs will need to be filled in the lowcarbon energy sector by 2030  to meet the countrys climate objectives that figure is expected to rise to 400000 by 2050 the uk energy sector as a whole currently supports 738000 jobs and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society  others can be reskilled and retrained helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition at a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from 18 million to 26 million by 2050  jobs that will span the full energy spectrum from researching and advising on lowcarbon solutions to installing and implementing them here are some of the roles that will be key to the lowcarbon energy transformation a wind farm under construction off the english coast wind turbine technicians according to the international energy agency iea wind power is this year set for a 17 increase in global energy generation compared to 2020 the biggest increase of any renewable power source the iea also forecasts that wind power will need to grow tenfold by 2050 if the world is to meet the goals of the paris agreement its not surprising therefore that wind turbine technicians  the professionals who install inspect maintain and repair wind turbines  are in high demand in the us wind turbine technician is the fastestgrowing job in the country  with 68 growth projected over the 20202030 period  to give just one example in the uk many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available they are not a prerequisite and many employers offer apprenticeships and onthejob training  smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role solar panel installers today solar photovoltaic solar pv is the biggest global employer in renewable energy accounting for 38 million jobs  the iea also reported a 23 uptick in solar pv installations around the world in 2020 in the uk there are currently 132 gigawatts gw of installed solar power capacity  trade association solar energy uk predicts this will need to rise to at least 40 gw by 2030 if the uk is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050 the trade association believes this could see the creation of 13000 new solar energy jobs solar panel installers  who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar pv  are essential to a lowcarbon future many solar panel installers in the uk come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering while there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers they are not a necessity particularly if you already have onthejob experience in a relevant sector this makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering energy consultants businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources as professionals who advise companies on this process renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energyintensive operations the core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a companys environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities carbon accountants a growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas ghg emissions but thats only possible if you can first determine what your ghg emissions are and where they come from which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in through what is known as physical carbon accounting companies can assess the emissions their activities generate and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring this allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions on a wider scale accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero battery technology researchers energy storage is essential to a lowcarbon energy future  the ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewablesdriven grid while many forms of energy storage already exist  developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage increased at an annual rate of 14  four times faster than the average for technology  between 2005 and 2018 however its estimated that to meet climate objectives the world will need nearly 10000 gw hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040 this is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries farmers and foresters how we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet crops like corn sugarcane and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy and farming byproducts such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrientrich enough to grow food these techniques include the use of biochar  a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer it also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrientdense forests meanwhile provide material for industries like construction the byproducts from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass primarily in the shape of lowgrade wood that would otherwise remain unused sustainably managed forests such as those from which drax sources its biomass have twofold importance they both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure co 2 is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle biofuel engineers and scientists farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels but its biofuel scientists and engineers who research develop and enhance them opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles heating and even jet engines according to the iea production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6 in 2019 however the organisation forecasts that production will need to increase 10 annually until 2030 to be in line with paris agreement climate targets scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world therefore continues to be vital as is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel the wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial lowcarbon roles geologists the overriding goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 and preferably to 15 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels this is an objective the iea has said will be  virtually impossible to fulfil without carbon capture and storage ccs technologies ccs entails capturing co 2 and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields coal seams and saline aquifers according to the global ccs institute the world will need a 100fold increase on the 27 ccs project currently in operation by 2050 knowledge and research into rock types formations and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe permanent carbon storage and sequestration skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy employees working at drax power station chemists the role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation knowledge and research around co 2 is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere technologies like ccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage becss  and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs  are based around such research carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents often based on amines and ghgs understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets chemists role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods from battery technology to reforestation chemists understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change bringing together disciplines tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the paris agreement depends on collaboration between industries countries and disciplines decarbonisation

which brings together 12 organisations including drax is expected to create as many as 47800 jobs in the region by 2027  among these are construction sector jobs for welders pipefitters machine installers and technicians in addition indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of zero carbon humber depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future draxs apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades and will continue to do so as we build a lowcarbon future options include fouryear technical apprenticeships in mechanical electrical and control and instrumentation engineering getting onthejob training and practical experience apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification such as a btec or an nvq level 3 at the end of the programme apprentices at drax power station 2021 the workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one  stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy it will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment the skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the uk and around the world

decarbonisation  careers  economic impact  engineering  technology  sustainability transporting carbon  how to safely move co 2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach its climate goals its just a matter of putting the pipes in place go deeper how do you store co 2 and what happens to it when you do tags

analysis 18 august 2021 sustainable bioenergy the enviva cottondale pellet mill has a production capacity of 760000 metric tonnes of wood pellets annually raw material used by the mill includes a combination of roundwood chips and secondary residuals ie sawdust and shavings with pine accounting for 8090 of total feedstock in october 2018 hurricane michael passed through the centre of the cottondale catchment area causing significant damage to the forest resource with more than 500000 hectares ha of forestland destroyed and an estimated loss of 42 million m 3 of timber equivalent to around 4 times the uk annual production of roundwood this event has had an impact on the data trends for forest inventory growth and harvesting removals  as harvesting levels were increased to salvage as much timber as possible before it became unusable due to decay this can be clearly seen in many of the charts below however these forest areas have been restored and now continue to grow allowing the catchment area to return to its prehurricane trends in the medium term forest area the catchment area around envivas cottondale pellet mill includes 43 million ha of land based on the historical feedstock sourcing patterns of the mill timberland represents 687 295 million ha of the total land area in the cottondale catchment area this has increased slightly since 2000 from 678 and can be considered to have remained stable over this time period there are also around 300000 ha of woodland associated with agricultural land and around 800000 ha of cropland and pastureland forestry is the dominant land use in this catchment area figure 1 figure 1 land area by usage planted pine represents 33 of the timberland area natural pine 20 with 10 mixed stands and the remainder being hardwood forest of which 94 is naturally regenerated figure 2 the breakdown of forest type and species composition has remained relatively stable and largely unchanged over the last 20 years in contrast to other parts of the us south where some natural pine stands have been converted to planted pine the pine and mixed forest areas are actively managed and produce the majority of the timber harvest in the catchment area despite the large area of hardwood forest management and timber production is limited much of this area is classified as bottomland hardwood located alongside rivers streams and creeks and in streamside management zones smzs which restricts active management in addition the proportion of this catchment area located in florida contains a large area of swampland which is largely composed of hardwoods and cannot be actively managed for timber production and is recognised as having important ecological value figure 2 breakdown of forest type volume and growth the overall trend of volume and growth in the cottondale catchment area is of a maturing forest resource and an increasing accumulation of standing volume particularly in the larger forest product classes sawtimber and chipnsaw figure 3 shows that total standing volume increased by 64 million m 3 from 2000 to 2018 with the largest increases in the pine sawtimber and chipnsaw categories in 2018 the devastating impact of hurricane michael caused a substantial reduction in the standing volume across every product category with the total standing volume being reduced by 42 million m 3  this event has had a significant impact on the forest resource and is a primary cause of recent data trends however the overall longterm trend in the catchment area is of maturing forest and increasing inventory this should continue in the longterm once the impact of the hurricane damage has been managed and replacement forest areas begin to mature figure 3 standing volume by product category pine pulpwood inventory increased steadily by around 8 million m 3 from 2000 to 2013 reaching a peak of 49 million m 3  this then declined slightly to 46 million m 3 in 2018 due to the maturing age class of the forest and pulpwood forest growing into the larger size class of chipnsaw and sawtimber forest figure 4 in addition to an increase in pulpwood demand as biomass markets became operational and ramped up production following the hurricane in 2018 the pine pulpwood inventory dropped by more than 10 million m 3  replanting and reforestation of damaged areas will ensure that future pine pulpwood production will increase again once these forests start to mature in the period from 2000 to 2018 pine sawtimber standing volume increased by 415 million m 3 78 and chipnsaw by 196 million m 3 73 indicating a maturing age class and a growing forest resource the 2018 hurricane caused a reduction in standing volume in both of these product categories of 116 and 8 million m 3 respectively 12 and 17 of the 2018 volume however the increasing trend is likely to continue once the forest area recovers figure 4 standing volume by product category the growth drain ratio gdr is the comparison of average annual growth to removals typically harvesting where the growth exceeds removals the gdr will be in excess of 1 and this is considered sustainable where removals exceed growth then the gdr will be less than 1 and this is not sustainable if maintained in the longterm  although in the shortterm this can be a factor of large areas of mature forest with low growth rates and high rates of harvesting short periods of high demand for a particular product or salvage harvesting after a natural disturbance the gdr should be considered over a longer time period to ensure it reflects the longterm trend in the period from 2003 to 2020 the combined gdr for pine products averaged 152 with a high of 184 and a low of 108 figure 5 figure 5 growth to drain ratio by product category the maturing forest resources can be clearly seen from the growth to removals data for each product category average tree sizes getting larger and more pulpwood class stands moving into the larger sawtimber and chipnsaw categories this trend can be seen by comparing the data values from 2003 and 2018 where sawtimber average annual growth increased by 90 16 million m 3  and removals by 41 098 million m 3  chipnsaw growth increased by 73 13 million m 3  whilst removals increased by 160 19 million m 3  pulpwood growth decreased by 75 04 million m 3  whilst removals increased by 63 16 million m 3  over this time period the total annual surplus of pine growth compared to removals averaged 37 million m 3 per year figure 6 figure 6 pine growth and removals by product category and year hardwood sawtimber and pulpwood removals declined by 20 and 40 respectively between 2000 and 2018 whilst growth increased by 23 for hardwood sawtimber and declined by 16 for hardwood pulpwood the average annual hardwood surplus over this time period was 15 million m 3 per year figure 7 figure 7 hardwood growth and removals by product category and year despite a shortterm imbalance in some product categories the overall surplus of pine growth compared to removals has remained strong with an average of 33 million m 3 between 2000 and 2020 which includes the increased salvage harvesting in 2018 figure 8 figure 8 cumulative annual surplus of growth compared to removals wood prices stumpage price is the value paid to the forest owner for each category of product at the time of harvesting the variation in prices in the cottondale catchment area has been significant and shows some interesting trends the higher value pine products sawtimber and chipnsaw began with high stumpage values in 2000 as markets were strong for construction and furniture grade timber and supply limited at that stage due to the young age class and predominance of pulpwood stands at that time in 2008 following the global economic crisis and the crash in housing and construction markets sawtimber prices declined substantially reaching a low of 23 per ton a 47 decline from the 2000 price this stumpage price has never recovered despite an improvement in the economy and an increase in housing starts and demand for structural timber the reason for the continued deflated sawtimber stumpage price is a substantial surplus of supply in this catchment area as the forest area has matured and more sawtimber grade stands are available markets have been able to satisfy demand without an increase in price pine pulpwood prices at cottondale were lower than the us southwide average in 2000 and remained relatively low until around 2013 a reduction in sawtimber production and consequent reduction in mill residuals due to the recession of 2008 led to a shortage of pulp mill feedstock and increased harvesting of pulpwood stands this caused an increase in pine pulpwood stumpage values alongside an overall increase in demand as biomass and pellet markets began production around this time the data shows a shortterm spike in pine pulpwood stumpage prices in 201314 but this returned to a more normal trend as more sawtimber residues became available and pulpwood stumpage values have been around 1011 per ton since 2015 figure 9 figure 9 variation in stumpage value over time biomass demand biomass demand in the cottondale catchment area began in 2008 and has averaged around 800 thousand m 3 per year since that time with a high of just over 1 million m 3 in 2013 to 2015 and a low of 200 thousand m 3 in 2008 other pulpwood markets have had an average annual demand of 397 million m 3 between 2000 and 2020 with a high of 476 million m 3 in 2018 and a low of 32 million m 3 in 2009 in 2020 the biomass market represented 16 of the total pulpwood demand in the cottondale catchment area figure 10 figure 10 total pulpwood demand forest management the average size of clearcut harvesting sites from 2000 to 2020 has been 47 ha ranging from 38 ha up to 56 ha the average size of thinning sites has been 65 ha ranging from 55 ha up to 76 ha when isolating the period from 2000 to 2010 and 2011 to 2020 the averages and range remain very similar suggesting that there has been no significant change in harvesting coupe size over this period figure 11 average size of harvesting sites the impact of biomass and wood pellet demand on the key metrics in this catchment area are considered below this is a summary of hood consultings view on the trends and impacts in the cottondale catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows a 55166hectare 19 increase in the total area of timberland in the enviva cottondale catchment area since the enviva cottondale pellet mill commenced production in 2008 furthermore a strong positive relationship was identified between biomass demand and timberland area suggesting that the increase in timberland area since 2008 can be linked to a degree to increased demand attributed to bioenergy a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however the evidence is inconclusive as to whether increased demand attributed to bioenergy has caused or is responsible for these changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that thinnings accounted for 63 of total reported harvest area in the cottondale market from 20052011 but only 39 of total harvest area reported from 20122020 specifically the decreased prevalence of thinning since 2012 can be linked to the strengthening of pine pulpwood markets and concurrent weakening of pine sawtimber markets beginning in the mid2000s prior to the bursting of the us housing bubble in 2006 timber management in this market had been driven to a large degree by pine sawtimber production however challenging market conditions saw pine sawtimber stumpages prices decline more than 40 from 20062011 at the same time pine pulpwood markets started to strengthen with pine pulpwood stumpage prices increasing more than 50 from 20062010 so with sawtimber markets weakening and pulpwood markets strengthening the data suggests that many landowners decided to alter their management approach ie to take advantage of strong pulpwood markets and focus on short pulpwood rotations that typically do not utilize thinnings bioenergy has had an impact on this market by adding an average of roughly 680000 metric tons of additional pine pulpwood demand to this catchment area annually since 2008 however bioenergy has accounted for only 17 of total softwood pulpwood demand in this market since enviva cottondales startup ultimately the shift in management approach that occurred in this market can be more closely linked to other factors such as increased softwood pulpwood demand from nonbioenergy sources ie pulppaper as well as the weakening of pine sawtimber markets diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 23 in the cottondale catchment area from 20082020 also there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused a diversion from other softwood pulpwood markets ie pulppaper as softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has increased 25 since the cottondale mills startup in 2008 an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices inconclusive the startup of enviva cottondale added more than 900000 metric tons of softwood pulpwood demand to the catchment area from 20082013 and this increase in demand coincided with a 28 increase in the delivered price of pine pulpwood ppw  the primary roundwood product consumed by the enviva cottondale mill however since 2013 delivered ppw prices have held flat despite biomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand falling to an average of roughly 635000 tons per year since 2016 down more than 40 compared to 2013 peak levels note the decrease in roundwood consumption was due to a higher utilization of secondary residuals its also important to point out that the roughly 410000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand from 2013 to 2020 was offset by a roughly 455000metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand from other sources statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however that relationship was found to be relatively weak the relationship between delivered ppw price and softwood pulpwood demand from other sources was found to be much stronger which was not unexpected to find given that softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 83 of total softwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2008 furthermore there is some evidence linking the increase in pine sawmill chip prices to increased consumption of secondary pine residuals by enviva cottondale specifically consumption of secondary pine residuals by enviva cottondale more than doubled from roughly 213000 metric tons in 2012 to nearly 490000 metric tons in 2016 and this increased consumption of pine residuals coincided with a nearly 20 increase in the price of pine sawmill chips however increased consumption of residuals by the bioenergy sector was only one of several contributing factors that can be linked to the increase in pine sawmill chip prices increased consumption of pine residuals by the pulppaper industry also contributed to higher pine sawmill chip prices in addition there is a strong linkage between pine sawmill chip prices and softwood lumber production specifically the increase in softwood lumber production that begun in the earlytomid2010s consequently resulted in the increased production of secondary residuals and the increased availability of this lowercost material led to greater competition and ultimately higher pine residual prices a reduction in growing stock timber no from 2008 the year enviva cottondale commenced production up until hurricane michael struck in late2018 total growing stock inventory increased an average of 18 per year 19 total in the cottondale catchment area specifically inventories of pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw increased 58 and 28 respectively while pine pulpwood ppw inventory decreased 4 over this same period however note that the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory from 20082018 was not due to increased demand from bioenergy or increased harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area as annual growth of pine pulpwood exceeded annual removals every year throughout this period rather this slight decrease in ppw inventory levels is more a reflection of the aging of the catchment area forest and the movement of stands classified as pulpwood to stands classified as chipnsaw a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service usfs data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber in the cottondale catchment area decreased from 59 in 2008 to 52 in 2020 suggesting that the sequestration rate of carbon also declined slightly over this period however there is little evidence to suggest that increased demand attributed to bioenergy is responsible for this change the reduction in overall growth rate and therefore reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon is more a reflection of the aging of the catchment area forest specifically growth rates decline as timber ages and this is exactly what usfs data shows in the cottondale catchment area with the average age of growing stock timber increasing from less than 44 years of age in 2008 to nearly 46 years of age in 2020 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual timber removals provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2020 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood ppw the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 126 recall that a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels note however that the ppw gr ratio averaged 157 in the catchment area from 20132017 before falling to 120 in 2018 and averaging 127 since this notable drop in 2018 was due to a nearly 35 increase in ppw removals due to hurricane michael its also important to note that while annual removals have moved back in line with premichael levels since 2019 this lower ppw gr ratio is likely reflective of the new norm at least over the midterm hurricane michael destroyed an estimated 22 of total pine pulpwood inventory in the cottondale catchment area and this loss in inventory will be reflected in reduced growth until the destroyed forests regenerate however in spite of this loss adequate ppw inventory levels still remain and sustainable market conditions are expected to persist moving forward timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood ppw decreased 25 in the catchment area from 20082020 however this substantial decrease was due to hurricane michael which destroyed nearly 520000 hectares of catchment area timberland when it hit the florida panhandle in late2018 prior to this event occurring ppw inventory levels had held relatively steady decreasing slightly but averaging 472 million m3 in the catchment area from 20082018 however the destruction caused by hurricane michael resulted in the immediate loss of more than 103 million m3 of ppw inventory or a 22 decrease compared to prehurricane levels moreover the slight decrease in ppw inventory levels that did occur from 20082018 was not due to increased demand from bioenergy typically a reduction in inventory is linked to harvest levels above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area but in the cottondale catchment area annual growth of ppw exceeded annual removals every year throughout this period ultimately the decrease in ppw inventory from 20082018 can be more closely linked to decreased pine sawtimber production beginning in the early to mid2000s specifically annual removals of pine sawtimber decreased 28 from 20032014 and the reduction in harvest levels over this period translated to a reduction in newlyreestablished pine stands and ultimately the slight reduction in ppw inventory levels that occurred in the midtolate 2010s timber growth rates neutral overall timber growth rates declined slightly in the catchment area from 2008 the year enviva cottondale commenced operations through 2020 however this decrease in timber growth rates was not due to increased demand attributed to bioenergy but rather to the aging of the catchment area forest specifically usfs data shows the average age timber inventory in the cottondale catchment area increased from an estimated 436 years of age in 2008 to 457 years of age in 2020 forest area positive in the enviva cottondale catchment area total forest area ie timberland increased more than 55100 hectares 19 from 2008 through 2020 and this increase can be linked to several factors including increases in softwood pulpwood demand from both bioenergy and other sources as well as conversion from farmland specifically the more than 55100hectare increase in catchment area timberland from 20082020 coincided with a 11million metric ton increase in annual softwood pulpwood demand roughly half of which was attributed to bioenergy while statistical analysis identified moderately strong positive relationships between timberland area and both softwood biomass demand and nonbioenergyrelated softwood pulpwood demand a strong positive correlation was found between timberland and total softwood pulpwood demand  suggesting that the increases in timberland since 2008 can be attributed in part to the increase in total softwood pulpwood demand from both bioenergy and other sources the more than 55100hectare increase timberland from 20082020 also coincided with a roughly 75000hectare decrease in farmland ie cropland woodland and pastureland over this period specifically the catchment area experienced a roughly 31800hectare loss in cropland 8900hectare loss in pastureland and 34300hectare loss in woodland from 20082020 furthermore statistical analysis confirmed this inverse relationship identifying a strong negative correlation between timberland and farmland in the cottondale catchment area wood prices negative  positive total softwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy in the cottondale catchment area increased from zero tons in 2007 the year prior to enviva cottondales startup to over 10 million metric tons in 2013 over this same period the price of delivered pine pulpwood ppw  the predominant roundwood product utilized by enviva cottondale for wood pellet production  increased 42 from 2106 per ton in 2007 to 2982 per ton in 2013 however the apparent link between increased softwood biomass demand and increased delivered ppw price is only loosely supported by statistical analysis which identified a relatively weak positive relationship between these two variables furthermore delivered ppw price has remained nearly unchanged in the catchment area since 2013 despite softwood biomass demand declining and averaging roughly 577000 metric tons per year since 2016 note that the roughly 410000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand from 20132020 was offset by a roughly 455000metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand from other sources ultimately the increase in delivered ppw prices in the catchment area can be linked to increased demand for softwood pulpwood from all sources and roughly half of the 12million metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand since 2007 can be attributed to bioenergy however its also important to note that the increase in bioenergyrelated wood demand has been a positive for forest landowners in the enviva cottondale catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood in this market but the increase in delivered ppw price resulting from increased softwood pulpwood demand from bioenergy has transferred through to landowners in the form of higher ppw stumpage prices specifically over the six years prior to enviva cottondales startup ppw stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  averaged roughly 740 per ton in the cottondale catchment area however since 2010 ppw stumpage prices have averaged more than 1115 per ton representing a more than 50 increase compared to premill startup levels markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva cottondale catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased an estimated 23 from 20082020 this increase in softwood lumber production has consequentially resulted in an increase in sawmill residuals ie chips sawdust and shavings  byproducts of the sawmilling process and materials utilized by enviva cottondale to produce wood pellets specifically softwood sawlog demand has increased more than 16 in the catchment area since 2014 and this increase in demand has coincided with a nearly 60 increase in pine residual purchases by enviva cottondale note that pine residuals constituted 25 of total raw material purchases by enviva cottondale in 2014 but 41 of total raw material purchases in 2020 so not only has enviva cottondale benefited from the greater availability of this sawmill byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as enviva cottondale has provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts read the full

is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs 9 july 2021 carbon capture what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs direct air carbon capture and storage dacs sometimes referred to as dac or daccs is one of the few technologies that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere unlike other carbon removal technologies that capture co 2 emissions during the process of generating electricity or heat dacs can be deployed anywhere in the world it can tap into a supply of electricity co 2 removal is crucial to meeting the international climate goals set by the 2015 paris agreement but its not enough just to cut co 2 emissions to achieve net zero  it will also be necessary to remove the co 2 that two centuries of industrialisation have released into the environment as a technology that removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  assuming it is powered by green electricity  dacs has the potential to play a key role in this process how does dacs work dacs could be described as a form of industrial photosynthesis just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and co 2 into sugar dacs systems use electricity to remove co 2 from the atmosphere using fans and filters air is drawn into the dacs system using an industrial scale fan liquid dacs systems pass the air through a chemical solution which removes the co 2 and returns the rest of the air back into the atmosphere solid dacs systems captures co 2 on the surface of a filter covered in a chemical agent where it then forms a compound the new compound is heated releasing the co 2 to be captured and separating it from the chemical agent which can then be recycled the captured co 2 can then be compressed under very high pressure and pumped via pipelines into deep geological formations  this permanent storage process is known as sequestration alternatively the co 2 can be pumped under low pressure for immediate use in commercial processes such as carbonating drinks or cement manufacturing a 2021 study by the coalition for negative emissions shows that dacs could provide at least 1gt of sustainable negative emissions by 2025 dacs fast facts human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of co 2 by 48 above preindustrial levels found in 1850 during prehistoric ice ages co 2 levels were around 200 parts per million ppm the average level in 2020 was more than 417ppm 101 out of 116 of the ipcc scenarios mitigating greenhouse gas emissions depend on using negative emissions technology  including dacs what role can dacs play in decarbonisation co 2 is in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world this means that dacs plants can be located anywhere unlike carbon capture systems that remove co 2 from industrial processes at source there are 15 dacs plants currently in operation worldwide  climeworks operates three in switzerland iceland and italy together these smallscale plants capture approximately 9000 tonnes of co 2 per annum the first largescale plant  currently being developed in the permian basin texas is expected to capture 1000000 tonnes one megatonne per annum when it becomes operational in 2025 at just 004 the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere is very dilute which makes removing and storing it a challenge this means that dacs costs significantly more than some other co 2 capture technologies  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne the process also requires large amounts of energy which adds to the demand for electricity however dacs has the potential to become an important piece in the jigsaw

2021 carbon capture what is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co 2  from biomass organic matter energy generation why is beccs important for decarbonisation sustainably sourced biomassgenerated energy bioenergy can be carbon neutral as plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow this in turn offsets co 2 emissions released when the biomass is combusted as fuel when sustainable bioenergy is paired with carbon capture and storage it becomes a source of negative emissions as co 2 is permanently removed from the carbon cycle experts believe that negative emissions technologies nets are crucial to helping countries meet the longterm goals set out in the paris climate agreement as beccs is the most scalable of these technologies this decade it has a key role to play in combating climate change how is the bioenergy for beccs generated most bioenergy is produced by combusting biomass as a fuel in boilers or furnaces to produce highpressure steam that drives electricitygenerating turbines  alternatively bioenergy generation can use a wide range of organic materials including crops specifically planted and grown for the purpose as well as residues from agriculture forestry and wood products industries energydense forms of biomass such as compressed wood pellets  enable bioenergy to be generated on a much larger scale fuels like wood pellets can also be used as a substitute for coal in existing power stations  how is the carbon captured beccs uses a postcombustion carbon capture process  where solvents isolate co 2 from the flue gases produced when the biomass is combusted the captured co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquidlike substance so it can then be transported by pipeline  how is the carbon stored captured co 2 can be safely and permanently injected into naturally occurring porous rock formations for example unused natural gas reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers water permeable rocks saturated with salt water this process is known as sequestration  over time the sequestered co 2 may react with the minerals locking it chemically into the surrounding rock through a process called mineral storage beccs fast facts two 600 megawatt mw biomass units upgraded with carbon

billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space around the uk according to the british geological survey is beccs sustainable bioenergy can be generated from a range of biomass sources ranging from agricultural byproducts to forestry residues to organic municipal waste during their lifetime plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere this balances out the co 2 that is released when the biomass is combusted whats crucial is that the biomass is sustainably sourced  be it from agriculture or forest waste responsibly managed sources of biomass are those which naturally regenerate or are replanted and regrown where theres a increase of carbon stored in the land and where the natural environment is protected from harm biomass wood pellets used as bioenergy in the uk for example are only sustainable when the forests they are sourced from continue to grow sourcing decisions must be based on science and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon biomass pellets can also create a sustainable market for forestry products which serves to encourage reforestation and afforestation  leading to even more co 2 being absorbed from the atmosphere go

proportion typically 2025 tonnes per acre of the lowgrade fibre produced at a harvest as a oneoff transaction for its wood pellet plant it is time consuming to walk every acre of restocked forest and it is not always possible to get an owners permission to access their land forests from space therefore an alternative methodology is required to make an assessment about the condition of forest lands that have been harvested to supply biomass without the need to physically inspect each site one option is to use remote sensing and satellite imagery to view each harvested site in the years after biomass sourcing this helps to monitor restocking and new tree growth drax has been testing the remote sensing approach using maxars commercial satellite imagery maxar has four satellites on orbit that collect more than three million square kilometres of highresolution imagery every day drax accesses this imagery through maxars subscription service securewatch  to test the viability of this methodology drax has been looking at harvesting sites in mississippi that supplied biomass to the amite bioenergy pellet plant in 2015 and in 2017 as part of the sustainability checks that are carried out prior to purchasing wood fibre drax collects information on each harvesting tract this includes the location of the site the type of harvest the owners longterm management intentions and species and volume details this data can then be used at a later date to revisit the site and monitor the condition of the area thirdparty auditors for instance through sustainable biomass program sbp certification  do visit harvesting sites however this is typically during the year of harvest rather than after restocking maxar has historical imagery of this region from 2010 which is prior to any harvesting for wood pellets the image below shows a harvesting site near the pellet plant at gloster mississippi before any harvesting has taken place march 2010 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies the image below shows the same site in 2017 immediately following harvesting december 2017 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies if we look again at this same site three years after harvesting we can see the rows of trees that have been planted and the quality of the regrowth this series of images demonstrates that this harvested area has remained a forest has not been subject to deforestation and that the regrowth appears to be healthy at this stage august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies another site in the amite catchment area is shown below the image shows a mature forest prior to harvesting the site has been previously thinned as can be seen from the thinned rows that are evident in the imagery may 2010 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies looking at the same site in the year after harvesting the clear cut area can be seen clearly some green vegetation cover can also be seen on the harvested area but this is weed growth rather than replanted trees some areas of mature trees have been left at the time of harvesting and are visible as a grey colour in the 2010 image these are likely to be streamside management zones that have been left to maintain biodiversity and to protect water quality with the grey winter colouring suggesting that they are hardwoods september 2018 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies three years after the harvest in a zoomed in view from the previous image clear rows of replanted trees can be seen in the imagery this demonstrates that the owner has successfully restocked the forest area and that the newly planted forest appears healthy and well established august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies while examining different harvesting sites in satellite imagery drax noted that not every site had evidence of tree growth particularly within the first three years after harvesting deliberate conversion of land to nonforest use such as for conversion to pasture agricultural crops or urban development is likely to be evident fairly soon after harvesting preparing for planting some forest owners like to leave a harvested site unplanted for a couple of years to allow ground vegetation and weed growth to establish this can then be treated to ensure that trees can be planted and that the weed growth does not impede the establishment of the new forest this process can mean that trees are not visible in satellite imagery for three to four years after harvesting the image below shows a site three years after harvesting with no evidence of tree growth given that no conversion of land use is evident and that the site appears to be clear of weed growth this is likely to be an example of where the owners have waited to clear the site of weeds prior to replanting this site can be monitored in future imagery from the maxar satellites to ensure that forest regrowth does take place november 2020 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies drax will continue to use maxars securewatch platform to monitor the regrowth of harvesting sites and will publish more detailed results and analysis when this process has been developed further the platform allows ongoing comparison of a site over time and could prove a more efficient method of analysis than ground survey in conjunction with the caa and hfl work phe can add remote sensing as a valuable

collaboration is key to tackling the climate crisis will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2021 opinion leaders from 40 countries are meeting today albeit virtually as part of president joe bidens leaders summit on climate  the event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change set a clear pathway to net zero emissions while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition since taking office president biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the united states back into the paris agreement ahead of the twoday summit he announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target and new nationally determined contributions the us joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per year sending it for secure storage permanently locking it away deep under the north sea experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy it would also act as an anchor project for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to create the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the humber region and more than 200000 around the uk in 2039 additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south and western canada a global company as a britishnorth american company drax embodies the positive impact that clean energy investments have we directly employ 3400 people in the us canada and the uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax is strongly committed to supporting the communities where we operate by investing in local initiatives to support the environment jobs education and skills from the working forests of the us south and western canada to the yorkshire and humber region and scotland we have a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 at drax we believe the challenge of climate change is an opportunity to improve the environment we live in we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 and transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the rest of the world  a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a
