rapid rise of electric vehicles evs over the last decade tells us anything its this the future of transport is electric but while evs may be the fastgrowing future of mobility their beginnings stretch right back to the days of the first automobiles today we associate evs with hallmark tech innovators like elon musk and his teslas but the original electric vehicle had a much more humble beginning  in a 19 th century workshop in scotland owned by a chemist named robert davidson  realising the potential of electric transport barking up the wrong electric motor tree by b bowers proceedings of the ieee 2004 using electricity to power transport has long made sense as a means of moving around quickly and efficiently robert davidson of aberdeen understood this as early as 1837 when he created his first electric motor  powered by zincacid batteries while davidson was a chemist he had a fascination with tinkering and engineering two years after creating his first motor he invited visitors to his electromagnetic exhibition where they could see a fully visualised electric model train capable of carrying two people at a time he would go on to develop a prototype dubbed the galvani which he tested on the edinburghglasgow railway in 1842 reaching a maximum speed of 4 miles per hour davidson overcame the hurdle of finding a battery strong enough to power a fullsized train by using liquid chemical batteries rather than solid ones however when they ran flat the chemicals had to be completely replaced there was a further spanner in the works when railway workers destroyed his locomotive fearing the move toward electric vehicles would put them out of a job it wasnt until 1884 that the first productionstandard electric car capable of being reproduced and sold to the public was unveiled the man behind this was thomas parker who was also responsible for electrifying the london underground his car was born out of a desire to minimise smoke and pollution in london a purpose which still rings true over 135 years later  more practical uses for these vehicles sprung from parkers initial foray with electric wagons being instituted in mines so their motors wouldnt pollute the air the parker electric 1890 invented by thomas parker the golden age mercedeselectrique advertisement from 1907  daimler ag evs came into their own in the early 1900s when popularity in europe and america surged unlike gasoline at the time petrol was the primary fuel source evs did not produce a strong stifling smell nor did they require gear changes or manual effort to start them such as using a hand crank it was during this period that many wellknown car manufacturing names began experimenting with electricity ferdinand porsche  founder of the eponymous sports car  produced an electric vehicle called p1 in 1898 before creating the worlds first hybrid offering which was powered by both electricity and a combustion engine mercedesbenz also offered up an electric model called the mercedes mixte in 1906 this car was adopted as a taxi in cities and was even developed into a race car in 1907 no longer seen as a threat to the existing coalpowered transport the evs of the time were limited by the charge in their batteries but experienced a vogue as city cars for the rich who wanted to travel short distances in style sales peaked in the early 1900s when roughly onethird of all cars on us roads were electric but evs first golden age came to an abrupt end in the 1920s with the arrival of the man whose name would become synonymous with car manufacturing the world over henry ford the rise of petrol when fords model t parked on the scene it brought with it affordable mass produced petrolpowered transport  ev popularity quickly began its descent their limited battery capacities had become a downside as road networks expanded and the discovery of more petroleum deposits meant that gasoline was more readily available and cheaper than recharging batteries electric milk float in barnet london 1970 one of the only evs that survived the next few decades was the quintessentially british milk float  which made up the majority of global evs for most of the 20 th century away from milk rounds and golf carts the entire electric automobile industry went silent and the technology stagnated  it looked like gasoline was here to stay that was until a very special electric car took a spin in outer space the moon is the limit in the summer of 1971 the world was glued to tv sets as the apollo 15 mission to the moon unfolded featuring a special guest  the new lunar roving vehicle which ran on battery power there are currently three rovers parked on the moon  and their continued evolution helped renew interest in electric powered vehicles throughout the 1960s and 70s it led to a few new batterypowered concept cars appearing manufactured by general motors apollo programme lunar rover now powered by lithium or nickelcadmium batteries these cars provided a viable option for those concerned about the economic fluctuations of the oil and gas industries with electricity not as exposed to market changes the pace of ev innovation picked up after the development of the lithiumion battery  which significantly extended life and power output opening the potential for electric vehicles to become more than just short distance city cars these cars werent produced en masse until the 2000s after more than three decades of the global environmental movement and its influence over public policy as the technology caught up with an ambition to find a practical alternative to fossil fuel powered transport the ev entered its second golden age tesla driving towards onshore wind farm where are we now today there are over 273000 electric cars on britains roads  but this is set to grow quickly and significantly by 2025 its estimated there will be 1 million evs on uk roads  by 2040 there could be as many as 11 million most mainstream car producers are now racing to take the lead in the ev market from the headline grabbing antics of tesla to the petrolpowered stalwarts of volkswagen nissan and even ford and its not just the personal vehicle industry where electricity is racing ahead as a fuel source everything from innercity scooters to the rapidlyevolving aviation industry are being electrified  the first electric passenger jet could be ready for takeoff as soon as 2027 powering the way that we travel has become one of the most important conversations around the future of transport  and taking a look into the past suggests that this time electric vehicles are
