asset base the portfolio principally consists of 26gw of assets which are highly complementary to draxs existing generation portfolio and play an important role in the uk energy system the assets include turbine hall at cruachan power station cruachan pumped storage hydro 440mw of largescale storage and flexible lowcarbon generation situated in argyll and bute scotland cruachan provides a wide range of system support services to the uk energy market in addition to providing merchant power generation cruachan has 35 million of contracted capacity payments for the period 2019 to 2022 cruachan which provides over 35 of the uks pumped storage by volume can provide longduration storage with the ability to achieve full load in 30 seconds which it can maintain for over 16 hours making it a strategically important asset remunerated by a broad range of noncommodity based revenues galloway hydro scheme river dee galloway and lanark runofriver hydro 126mw of stable and reliable renewable generation situated in southwest scotland both locations benefit from indexlinked roc revenues extending to 2027 and galloway in addition to renewable power generation operates a reservoir and dam

level of support damhead creek ii is eligible for the 2019 capacity market auction along with two of draxs existing ocgt projects other smaller sites the portfolio also includes a small ccgt in blackburn 60mw and a 50k tonne biomassfromwaste facility in daldowie which benefits from a firm offtake contract agreement with scottish water until 2026 benefits of the acquisition a leading provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility increased earnings potential aligned with generation strategy and uk

intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility high quality earnings two thirds of the gross profits of the portfolio is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs in addition to power generation activities due to the expected growing demand for these assets and the contractbased nature of many of these services drax expects to improve longterm earnings visibility through structured noncommodity earnings streams whilst retaining significant opportunity to benefit from power price volatility when combined with renewable earnings and system support from existing biomass generation the acquisition is expected to lead to an increase in the quality of earnings diversified generation and portfolio benefits wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the acquisition accelerates draxs development from a singlesite generation business into a multisite multitechnology operator with the acquisition of this portfolio a fall in gas prices could be mitigated by an increase in gasfired generation reflecting the relative dispatch economics of the different technologies drax expects to benefit from the management of generation across a broader asset base leveraging the groups expertise in the operation trading and optimisation of large rotating mass generation drax believes that the team operating the portfolio has a strong engineering culture which is closely aligned with the drax model and will enhance the groups strong capabilities across engineering disciplines around 260 operational roles will transfer to drax as part of the acquisition complementing and reinforcing draxs existing engineering and operational capabilities financing and capital structure drax has entered into a fully underwritten 725 million secured acquisition bridge facility to finance the acquisition with a term of 12 months from the

group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material change from the historical 10year average rainfall there are no material adverse events that have a significant impact on the financial performance of any of the acquired assets including any more unplanned outages than would be expected in the ordinary course prior to completion the business will be operated in the ordinary course there are no material issues with the transitional services provided by scottish power to drax pursuant to the tsa including the migration of such services to drax there is no material change in the management or control of the drax group end tags daldowie  hydroelectric power  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy storage  electricity generation  decarbonisation  investors  gas  biomass energy coal comeback pushes up uks carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 17 september 2018 opinion 10year high gas prices 1 have prompted a resurgence in coalfired power across britain  and with it a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation if coalfired electricity remains cheaper than gasfired  as analysts predict  we could see the first yearonyear rise in carbon emissions from britains power sector in six years this highlights the importance of retaining a strong carbon price if we are to ensure the successful decarbonisation of the power system is not reversed after dropping to a historic low of just 02 gw during june and july britains coal power generation doubled in august and has shot up to 2 gw during the first week of september the last time coal output was this high was during the beast from the east  when temperatures plummeted in march with these coal power stations running instead of more efficient gas plants britain is producing an extra 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  every hour 2 carbon emissions from electricity generation are up 15 as a result these coal plants are not running solely because they are needed to meet peak demand but because gas prices have risen sharply and carbon prices have not kept up making coal power stations more economic to run than gasfired ones it became cheaper to generate power from coal than from gas see thick lines chart below in late august even though carbon prices now double the cost of generating electricity from coal 3 coal plants are consistently in the money at the moment meaning they can generate power profitably all day and night estimated cost of generating electricity from coal and gas in quarter 3 thick lines and the output from coal power stations in britain thin line the cost of emitting co 2 has increased sharply up 45 so far this year due to the ongoing rally in european emissions trading scheme eu ets prices rising carbon prices should make gas more economical to burn as it emits less than half the co 2 of coal however wholesale gas prices have also risen 40 since the start of the year as supplies and storage are squeezed in the run up to winter  gas prices are at a tenyear high currently 14 above their previous quarterlyaverage peak back in 2013 see chart below  these rising costs are feeding through into wholesale power prices which have risen by a third over the past year to hit 60mwh the estimated cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels over the last 20 years along with the cost of emitting co 2  britains carbon price strengthened dramatically through 201415 due to the government implementing a carbon price support scheme this caused gas to become competitive against coal for power generation leading to carbon emissions from the power sector halving  unless britains carbon price can once again make up the gap between coal and gas prices we risk rolling back some of the worldleading gains made on cleaning up our electricity system  the committee on climate change has made it clear that power is the only sector that is pulling its weight when it comes to decarbonising the uk clean electricity could power lowcarbon vehicles and heating but this opportunity will be wasted if the electricity comes from highcarbon coal so what can be done the sharp rise in gas prices hints at a lack of flexibility in the energy system britain came uncomfortably close to gas shortages in march in part due to the closure of the countrys largest gas storage site with nearly half of the electricity generated in britain coming from gas plus fivesixths of household heat diversifying into other  cleaner  energy sources would help insulate consumers and businesses from price spikes no one country has the power to determine international fuel prices several factors have come together to push up gas prices  including a lack of transmission capacity depleted stores of gas after the long hot summer and a lack of wind power increased output from gasfired stations suppliers which dont wish to be caught short after the beast from the east are also stocking up on gas any kneejerk reaction to try and lower the cost of electricity for example slashing the cost of carbon emissions may only have a shortterm impact and could easily lead to longerterm damage such as the resurgence of coal which would require further interventions in the future britain does have control over its carbon price its power stations and industry currently pay the emissions trading system price determined on the europewide market which has fluctuated wildly over the past week between 25 22 and 19 17 per tonne plus 18 per tonne in carbon price support which goes to the treasury this needs to be maintained or strengthened further to save the power system from backsliding and

must be burnt to produce 1 mwh of electricity now costs around 31 and the co2 pollution costs an extra 31 on top for comparison producing 1 mwh of electricity from gas costs 50 for the fuel and 15 for

the uks biggest coal power station took its first steps away from the fossil fuel which defined electricity generation for more than a century it was in that year that drax power station began cofiring biomass as a renewable alternative to coal it symbolised the beginnings of the power stations ambitious transformation from fossilfuel stalwart to the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator this plan presented a massive engineering challenge for drax with significant amounts of new knowledge quickly needed fifteen years later three of its generating units now run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of biomass while coal has been relegated to stepping in only to cover spikes in demand and improve system stability  now drax has converted a fourth unit from coal to biomass this development represents the passing of a two thirds marker for the power stations coalfree ambitions and adds 600plus megawatts mw of renewable electricity to great britains national transmission system  building on the past drax first converted a coal unit to biomass in 2013 with two more following in 2014 and 2016 this put drax in an interesting position going into a new conversion on one hand it is one of the most experienced generators in the world when it comes to dealing with and upgrading to biomass on the other its still relatively new to the low carbon fuel compared with its dealings with coal adam nicholson weve decades of understanding of how to use coal but weve only been operating with biomass since we started the full conversion trials in 2011 says adam nicholson section head for process performance at drax power weve got few running hours under our belts with the new fuel versus the hundreds of man years of coal knowledge and operation all around the country when converting a generating unit the steam turbine and generator itself remain the same the difference is all in the material being delivered stored crushed and blown into the boiler and burned to heat up water and create steam and because biomass can be a volatile substance  much more so than coal  this process must be a careful one drax could build on the learnings and equipment it had already developed for biomass such as specially built trains and pulverising mills  but storage proved a bigger issue the giant biomass domes at drax that make up the ecostore are advanced technological structures carefully attuned to storing biomass but for unit 4 they were off limits instead drax engineers had to come up with another solution the journey of a pellet through the power station normally wood pellets are brought into drax by train unloaded and stored in the biomass domes before travelling through the power station to the mills and then boilers  unit 4 however sits in the second half of the station  built 12 years after the first this slight change in location presented a problem theres no link from the eco store to unit 4 at all explains nicholson you cant use the storage domes and that whole infrastructure to get anything to unit 4 drax engineers set about designing a new conveyor system that could connect the domes to the mills and boiler that powers unit 4 after weeks of design the team had a theoretical plan to connect the two locations with one problem it was entirely uneconomical rail unloading building 1 and storage silos if we were building a new plant it would be relatively easy because you could plan properly and wouldnt have existing equipment in the way says nicholson we had to plan around it and make use of the preexisting plant within that preexisting plant though were vital pieces of equipment some of which had laid dormant since drax stopped fuelling its boilers with a mixture of coal and biomass and opted instead for full unit conversions drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003 using two different materials  a mix of around 5 biomass and 95 coal a direct injection facility was added in 2005 it involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power stations 60 mills  then the amount of renewable power drax was able to generate roughly doubled in the summer of 2010 when a 400 mw cofiring facility became operational back to the present day its fortunate for the unit 4 conversion that the cofiring facility includes its own rail unloading building rub 1 and storage silos they are located much closer to the unit than the bigger rub 2 and the massive biomass domes this solved the problem of storage but moving the required volumes of biomass through the plant without significant transport construction still posed a challenge rail unloading building 1 and storage silos for unit 4 left ecostore biomass domes for units 13 right to tackle this the team modified a pneumatic transport system previously tested during cofiring to have the capability to blow entire pellets from the storage facilities around the power station at speeds of more than 20 metres per second the success of this system proved key  it was the final piece necessary to make the conversion of unit 4 economical  the postcoal future andy koss for now draxs fifth and sixth generating unit remain coalpowered but are called upon less frequently with great britain set to go completely coalfree by 2025 there are plans to convert these too but as part of a system of combined cycle gas turbines and giant batteries rather than biomass powered units its an opportunity for drax to again leverage its preexisting plant and provide the grid with a fast actingsource of lowercarbon electricity as with converting to biomass it will pose a complex new engineering challenge  one that will prepare drax to meet the future needs of grid as it continues to change and demand greater flexibility from generators the speed at which the unit 4 project has been delivered is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we continue to see at drax were nimble and innovative enough to meet future challenges says andy koss chief executive drax power we may look very different in 10 or 20 years time but the ethos of that innovation and agility is something that will persist repowering the remaining coal plant with gas and up to 200 mw of batteries will sit alongside research into areas such as carbon capture use and storage ccus that is all geared towards expanding drax power beyond a single site generator into a portfolio of flexible power production facilities unit 4s conversion is more than just a step beyond halfway for the power stations decarbonisation but a significant step towards becoming entirely coalfree  find out more about unit 4  tags biomass energy  technology  drax power station  coal  investors great britain is almost ready for coalfree summers 14 august 2018 power generation every summer great britain uses less and less coal this june the fossil fuels share of the electricity mix dipped below 1 for the first time ever  for 12 days it dropped all the way to zero spurred on by the beginnings of an uncharacteristically dry hot summer and a jump in solar generation the possibility of the country going entirely coalfree for a full summer now looks more achievable than ever in modern times this is one of the key findings from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london it found that across q2 2018 there were as many coalfree hours as in the whole of 2016 and 2017 combined and while the reports findings are hugely positive they also hint at where development is still needed what else does the performance of this quarter tell us about what we can expect in the power sector  in great britain and around the world great britain is slashing coal generation the rest of the world needs to catch up great britain has reduced its coalfired power generation by fourfifths over the last five years last quarter the countrys coal fleet ran at just 3 of its 129 gigawatt gw capacity coal capacity is now lower than the capacity of solar pv panels 131 gw installed nationwide with the most recent decline resulting from draxs conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass  when coal generation was running it primarily provided system balancing services overnight in may and june rather than baseload electricity however this positive trend is not seen around the world the share of coal in national power systems during 2017 globally coal still provides 38 of the worlds electricity  the same amount it did 30 years ago this comes despite efforts in europe and north america to move away from coal and growing investment into renewable generation and technologies overall europes coal generation dropped from 39 to 22 over the last 30 years  despite some countries  such as poland and serbia  still drawing significant generation from the fossil fuel the us has also reduced its coal generation from 57 to 31 over the past 30 years as natural gas proves more economical even in an era of procoal policies  coal train at rail station in india however in the middle east and africa which draw significant generation from their oil and gas reserves and south america where coal accounts for less than 3 of generation total coal generation is growing in fact globally only seven countries use less coal today than 30 years ago germany poland spain ukraine the us great britain and canada electric insights attributes part of this global growth to the continued increase in demand for electricity particularly in asia china south korea and indonesia collectively burn 10 times more coal than they did 30 years ago indias coal habit has also increased over the past decade to account for 76 of its electricity generation while japans usage has grown from 15 to 34 in the same period as well as the stresses created by growing demand this highlights a global disparity in the approach to decarbonising electricity systems and a need for longerterm environmentally and sociallyconscious marketbased initiatives that encourage meaningful movement to lowercarbon electricity sources such as the uk and canadas powering past

harder great britains decline in coal use has rapidly accelerated its decarbonisation efforts annual coal power station emissions have shrunk over the past five years from 129 to 19 million tonnes of co 2 and helped reduce the average carbon intensity of electricity generation to a record low of 195 gkwh last quarter however this rapid pace of decarbonisation is unlikely to be sustained as growth in renewables faces a plateau the countrys current nuclear capacity reaches retirement and the target of moving beyond coal by 2025 is completed renewable sources now account for a steady 25 of annual electricity generation these sources largely came onto the system through policies such as the governments renewables obligation which is now closed to entrants contracts for differences the future of which is uncertain for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and feedin tariffs for rooftop solar installations which will close in april 2019 the end of these initiative paints a hazy picture of how future renewable capacity will be brought into the system nuclear capacity also looks unlikely to expand at the rate needed to plug gaps in demand with half of the countrys fleet

sector decarbonisation stalled ramsgate kent during summer 2018 heatwave weather will continue to play a major part in renewable generation if the first quarter of 2018 was defined by low temperatures and heavy snowfall  the second quarter saw the impact of the opposite in weather conditions from 23 june a heatwave set in around the country that saw temperatures increase by 33 o c in a week driving demand to jump 860 mw  the equivalent of an extra 25 million households or an area the size of scotland  the increase in demand isnt as drastic as when cold fronts hit but if summers continue to get hotter this could change today wintertime demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it drops below 14 o c as electric heaters are plugged in to aid largely gasbased centralheating systems when the mercury rises however demand increases by 350 mw for every degree rise over 20 o c as businesses turn on air conditioning and the countrys refrigerators work harder these heatwave spikes are at the moment more easily dealt with than winter storms while the beast from the east saw demand reaching a peak of 533 gw junes topped out at 325 gw the clear skies and long days of june also meant solar pv generation soared making up for the wind drought caused by the highpressure weather wind output floated between 03 gw and 43 gw in june far below its quarter peak to 13 gw however solar made up for this by peaking past 8 gw for 13 days in june and setting a new record of 939 gw at lunchtime on 27 june read the full articles how the heat wave affects electricity demand the summer wind drought and

march we saw how the beast from the east caused a surge in demand now the long summer heatwave is doing the same june 23 rd marked the start of the heatwave with daytime temperatures surpassing 30c in scotland and wales the last week of june was 33c warmer than the previous week and demand was 860 mw higher see chart below  this rise is equivalent to power demand from an extra 25 million households this reflects the growing role of air conditioning and refrigeration in shops and cooling for data centres global electricity demand from cooling is rising dramatically and is seen as a  blind spot  in the global energy system this will become more important as global temperatures and more importantly global incomes rise however it is easier to deal with than cold spells during winter because demand is low and solar pv output is high below 14c demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it gets colder as buildings need more heating around a tenth of british homes have electric heating as do half of commercial and public buildings  and while the uk is not synonymous with air conditioners demand rises by 350 mw for each degree that temperature rises above 20c this effect may well grow stronger in the coming years national grid expect that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade perhaps events such as the current prolonged heatwave may spur more
