exciting expansion plans we will ensure the station remains at the heart of the community as well as scotlands energy system for many decades to come the recent cop 26 climate conference in glasgow underlined the need to invest in renewables to decarbonise our economy in 2020 enough wind power to supply a million homes went to waste in the uk because there wasnt enough capacity to ensure this excess renewable power was stored and made available when it was needed by expanding cruachan we will help to stop that from happening by ensuring more renewable power is available to scotlands homes and businesses when they need it reducing costs whilst helping the planet a further exhibition will be held in early 2022 prior to submission of a section 36 application to the scottish government for their consideration the submission is expected to be made in spring with a decision from the government expected to be received in 2023 the project requires a new financial stability support mechanism from the uk government to secure private investment in longduration storage sites such as cruachan if this is developed and the planning application is approved then work to build the new capacity at

hydro power station will support more renewables and enable deeper decarbonisation of the uk energy system enough wind power to supply a million uk homes went unused in the uk in 2020 because there isnt enough storage available to prevent it going to waste former australian pm malcolm turnbull is an international proponent for pumped storage hydro having been at the forefront of the drive to build the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the southern hemisphere when he was in office cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built inside a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain its reversible turbines enable the plant to act like a giant water battery by pumping water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power helping scotland to be greener whilst cutting household energy bills earlier this year drax published exciting plans to build a new underground pumped storage hydro power station at cruachan  more than doubling the electricity generating capacity at the site mr turnbull is a board member of the international hydropower association and cochair of the international forum on pumped storage hydropower during his time in office he announced the construction of snowy hydro 20 the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the southern hemisphere while visiting cruachan mr turnbull said within the climate crisis the world is facing an ignored crisis  how to ensure that we do not fall back on fossil fuels when the wind isnt blowing and the sun isnt shining we need green energy security solutions i commissioned the snowy 20 pumped storage hydro plant to prevent blackouts in australia  the biggest such project in the southern hemisphere it was fascinating to visit draxs cruachan power station in scotland it reminds me that this is a tried and tested technology with draxs expansion plans for the project it can also be modern and with the right market focus on energy security and balance affordable the 5gw of such projects in the pipeline in scotland are central to deliver a net zero energy system in the uk ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said we were very happy to welcome mr turnbull to cruachan so he can see how this iconic power station is playing a critical role in balancing britains power system and enabling more renewables to come online our exciting plans to more than double the generating capacity of cruachan underlines draxs commitment to tackling the climate crisis and supporting the energy system as it continues to decarbonise expanding cruachan will unlock more renewable electricity to power homes and businesses across the country and support hundreds of new jobs in rural scotland eddie rich ceo of the international hydropower association added no national electricity grid has been able to decarbonise without a significant element of hydropower projects like cruachan demonstrate how easy it is to backup our wind energy resources in the uk with other renewables gas is not the only storage option as they say water wind and sun get the job done i hope to see other pumped storage come online in scotland in the next decade the expanded power station could be up and running as soon as 2030 subject to a successful planning application with the project supporting around 900 jobs during construction the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the existing lack of a framework for largescale longduration storage means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation ends media contacts

to build the new pumped storage hydro power station could get underway in 2024 with it becoming operational supplying flexible power to the grid in 2030 no investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework with the uk government a recent report by the renewable energy association rea highlighted the policy barriers to deploying longduration energy storage and suggested ways to address these barriers such as through the introduction of an income floor analysis by pumped storage hydro experts stantec for drax shows 876 jobs will be supported directly and indirectly during construction built on the shores of loch awe in argyll in the 1960s cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system of its scale to be built in

the pond dipping activity the students took part in pond dipping created a bug hotel and hunted for insects and other minibeasts in the woods before finishing off the day by toasting marshmallows on a fire for some of these year one and two primary pupils it was the first school outing they have had the opportunity to go on due to long periods of learning from home during the pandemic gywneth beaumont teacher at camblesforth community primary academy said our pupils had a great time at the skylark centre the sessions were well planned and resourced and the children had a lot of fun while also learning so much in just one day they especially loved having marshmallows round the fire at the end the staff were amazing and looked after not only the children but the adults as well we will definitely be returning drax group head of sustainable business alan knight added were so pleased to be able to welcome young people to our skylark centre and nature reserve for educational visits again we work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children to study science technology engineering and maths stem subjects getting out of the classroom to explore nature is an important part of that we hope that experiences like these will spark an interest in learning about the natural world around us the skylark centre has recently upgraded its learning resources to ensure that the activities on offer support the national curriculum with a particular focus on science and geography the centre has achieved national recognition for its educational visits and has been awarded a learning outside the classroom lotc quality badge endorsed by the department for education dr anne hunt chief executive of the council for learning outside the classroom said educational visits are among the most memorable experiences in a childs school life the lotc quality badge offers teachers a guarantee that the venue is providing high quality educational experiences and have the appropriate risk management structures in place meaning less paperwork for schools and peace of mind for teachers i congratulate the skylark centre and nature reserve on being awarded the lotc quality badge skye richard age 5 from camblesforth community primary academy schools planning a visit to the nature reserve can choose from educational activities centred around plants or insects or a combination of the two with all the learning materials able to be adapted to suit any primary school age group the group can then choose an outdoor adventure activity to add onto the end of their visit such as den building orienteering and team building games the visitor centre team are continuing to follow government guidance and take all the necessary precautions against covid19 to ensure that the skylark centre and nature reserve is a safe environment for those who visit drax is committed to supporting stem education and while inperson visits to the power station had to stop throughout the covid19 pandemic the company has continued to offer educational resources including virtual tours and work experience  drax hopes to resume school visits to site early next year ends media contacts megan hopgood communications officer e email protected t 07936 350 175 editors notes the nature reserve owned by drax is open to members of the public and offers a wide variety of educational experiences for schoolchildren to learn about nature and ecology as part of the national curriculum the skylark centre located on site is equipped with classroom facilities to give students a full handson experience of the local environment find out more about visiting the skylark centre and nature reserve here  about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 3400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers drax is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses supplying 100 renewable electricity as standard to more than 370000 sites through drax and opus energy it offers a range of energyrelated services

gardiner the governments net zero strategy published today is a key step forward as the uk looks towards a zerocarbon future its also a clear endorsement of the vital role that drax will continue to play in helping the uk reach its net zero targets it highlights the significant contributions that both our negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and the expansion of our pumped storage hydro capacity could play in generating renewable energy in the uk for the uk whilst also addressing the climate crisis it is important that the government now advances its plans to develop business models for greenhouse gas removal technologies so as to enable companies like drax to invest in these and ensure their deployment in the 2020s background beccs at drax government proposals envisage that by 2030 significant deployment of mature beccs technologies will be required with retrofit applications in the power and industrial sectors beccs applications in the power sector could be deployed by the late 2020s and potentially achieve ambitious contributions to our ndc target by 2030 strategy stresses the need for engineered ggrs to deploy over the next decade with an estimated 23mt of co2 needed to be removed by 2035 and between 75 and 81mt by 2050 new government ambition to deliver at least 5mtco2year of engineered greenhouse gas removals ggrs by 2030 drax is ready to invest more than 2bn in two beccs units at drax power station with the creation of tens of thousands of jobs once up and running beccs at drax will permanently remove at least 8mt of co2 from the atmosphere each year whilst supporting the creation of a new global industry in the uk delivering tens of thousands of jobs in a new green economy this builds on what we have already achieved with sustainable biomass in transforming a coal fired power station to become europes biggest decarbonisation project the uk has decarbonised its energy system faster than any other countrys as a result of the support the government made available to renewables like offshore wind solar and biomass with the right policies the same could be achieved for negative emissions technologies  demonstrating the same global climate leadership the uk has a track record of delivering drax power station produces 12 of the uks renewable electricity keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses we have reduced our emissions by more than 90 in the last decade and drax is now one of europes lowest carbon energy generators cruachan expansion the strategy outlines flexibility and storage technologies as one of the three key pillars to support the decarbonisation of the power system alongside renewables and nuclear like draxs existing cruachan facility in argyll the new station will be able to provide lifeline stability services to the power system alongside acting like a giant water battery by using reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside the station can store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand the stored water would then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this will help to cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power the new station would have the capacity to generate enough power for around a million homes the new 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the new power station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side to the east of draxs existing 440mw pumped storage hydro station more than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station the existing upper reservoir which can hold 24 billion gallons of water has the capacity to serve both power stations if planning consent is given for the new power station the extra capacity could be available in 2030 alongside planning consent the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the lack of an existing framework for largescale longduration storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation the government recently issued a call for evidence to explore the need to provide further market intervention to support lles technologies  1  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  60  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email
