the uk power systems biggest challenges shorter days and falling temperatures ramp up demand for electricity and gas to power lights and heating across the country this can put strain on the grid even leading to blackouts if not carefully managed in anticipation of potentially difficult times national grid assesses britains winter energy system to determine how much power were going to need and more importantly to ensure generators can produce enough to meet demand in its most recent report looking at winter 201718  national grids take is a positive one there will be enough power to meet demand more than that it has the potential to be cleaner than ever before  what to expect from electricity this winter in the report national grid forecasts a surplus power margin how much generation capacity will exceed estimated demand of 103  a significant increase from last years 57 margin what does this mean in real terms the report predicts a peak electricity demand of nearly 51 gw during the darkest coldest days of middecember by contrast the total possible capacity of the uks energy system during winter is 1012 gw not including interconnectors importing power from abroad it is important to note however that 1012 gw is more a theoretical number than an expected one considering normal occurrences such as planned outages breakdowns or other operational issues that prevent power stations generating their usual output a more accurate estimate is 661 gw but electricity isnt the only resource put under strain in the winter months  gas is also in high demand for heating and for electricity generation in the report national grid predicts this winter to have a lower gas demand than last year owing largely to a decrease in gasfuelled electricity generation however where gasfired electricity is likely to remain integral is in plugging the gaps in electricity supply left by intermittent renewables the system under stress weather plays a huge part in both the consumption and generation of power  during the winter when days are shorter and darker and the wind calmer solar and wind cannot generate and feed into the power grid as they normally would this means when there are sudden spikes in demand such as in a cold snap national grid must secure other sources to avoid disruption which can sometimes include carbonintensive coal diesel generators or importing power from europe this growing pressure on the system requires flexible and reliable sources of energy that can quickly react to these sudden surges biomass is a reliable flexible renewable and available at scale its able to provide the full range of support services the grid needs to retain stable supplies  whatever the weather says drax power ceo andy koss drax power stations south cooling towers recycle water and feed it back into the boilers where 17 of the uks renewable electricity is generated lowcarbon winter energy the ability to secure sufficient reliable and lowercarbon power over the winter months is key to the ongoing decarbonisation of the uk biomass and gas will play an important role in allowing the country to operate with less dependence on fossil fuels weve already made significant headway in this field last year christmas day was powered by more renewable electricity than ever before while each quarter of 2017 has seen new clean energy records broken  as we move into another winter its imperative generators and operators focus on the security of supply that the stability of our power system will be secured by lower carbon sources is an added  and much needed  bonus tags energy policy  flexibility and stability and power system security  national grid the silent force that moves electricity 31 august 2017 power generation in the early evening of 14 th august 2003 new york city in the midst of a heatwave lost its power  offices stores transport networks wall street and the un building all found their lights and phones cut off gridlocked streets and a stalled subway system forced millions to commute home on foot while those unable to make it back to the suburbs set up camp around the city it wasnt just the big apple facing blackout  what had started with several power lines in northern ohio brushing against an overgrown tree had spread in eight minutes to affect eight us states and two canadian provinces in total more than 50 million people were impacted 6 billion was lost in damages and 12 deaths were reported while a software glitch and the outdated nature of the power system contributed to the disaster the spread from a few highvoltage power lines to the entire north west was caused by a lack of reactive power  the pump powering electricity electricity that turns on light bulbs and charges phones is whats known as active power  usually measured in watts w kilowatts kw megawatts mw or in even higher units however getting that active power around the energy system efficiently economically and safely requires something called reactive power which is used to pump active power around the grid reactive power is measured in mega volt amps reactive  mvar  its generated in the same way as active power by large power stations but is fed into the system in a slightly different manner which leads to limitations on how far it can travel reactive power can only be effective locallyregionally  it does not travel far so across the country there are regional reactive power distributors servicing each local area imagine a long hose pipe that needs individual pumps at certain points along the way to provide the thrust necessary to transport water but power stations arent the only source of reactive power some electronic devices like laptops and tvs actually produce and feed small amounts of reactive power back into the grid in large numbers this increases the amount of reactive power on the grid and when this happens power stations must absorb the excess this is because although its essential to have reactive power on the grid it is more important to have the right amount too much and power lines can become overloaded which creates volatility on the network such as in the new york blackout too little and efficiency decreases think once again of the long hose pipe  if the pressure is too great the hose is at risk of bursting if the pressure is too low water wont travel through it properly this process of managing reactive power is at its heart one of ensuring active power is delivered to the places it needs to be but it is also one of voltage control  a delicate balancing act that if not closely monitored can lead to serious problems keeping volatility at bay across britain all electricity on the national grid must run at the same voltage either 400kv or 275kv  it is stepped down from 132kv to 230v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to equipment being damaged or large scale blackouts national grid monitors and manages the nationwide voltage level to ensure it remains within the safe limit and doing this relies on managing reactive power ian foy head of ancillary services at drax explains when cables are lightly loaded with a low level of power running through them such as overnight when electricity demand is lower they start emitting reactive power causing the voltage to rise to counter this generators such as drax power station  under instruction from national grid can change the conditions in their transformers from exporting to absorbing reactive power in just two minutes this relies on 24hour coordination across the national grid but as our power system continues to evolve so do our reactive power requirements and this is partly down to the economys move from heavy industry to business and consumer services the changing needs for reactive power large industrial power loads such as those required for big motors mills or coal mines bring voltage down and create a demand for more reactive power explains foy now with more consumer product usage the demand for active power is falling and the voltage is rising the result is that drax and other power stations now spend more time absorbing reactive power rather than exporting it to keep voltage levels down in the past by contrast foy says the power plant would export reactive energy during the day and absorb it at night as britains energy system decarbonises the load on powerlines also becomes lighter as more and more decentralised power sources such as wind and solar are used to meet local demand rather than large power plants supplying wider areas this falling load on the power system increases the voltage and creates a greater need for generators to absorb reactive power from the system it highlights that while draxs role in balancing reactive power has changed it remains an essential service this short story is adapted from a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the

electricity  investors  national grid why we need the whole country on the same frequency 23 june 2017 power generation the modern world sits on a volatile fizzing web of electricity in 2015 the uk consumed roughly 303 terawatt hours twh of electricity according to government statistics  thats an awful lot of power humming around and in this country we take it for granted that electricity is controlled this means the power supply coming into your home or place of work is reliable and wont trip your fuse box in short it means your mobile phone will keep on charging and your washing machine will keep on spinning but generating and circulating electricity at safe usable levels is not an easy task one of the most overlooked aspects of doing this is electrical frequency  and how its regulated what is electrical frequency to understand the importance of frequency we need to understand a couple of important things about power generation generators work by converting the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine into electrical energy in a steamdriven generator like those at drax power station  high pressure steam turns a turbine which turns a rotor mounted inside a stator copper wire is wound around the rotor energised with electricity this turns it into an electromagnet with a north and south pole the stator is made up of large heavy duty copper bars which enclose the rotor as the rotor turns its magnetic field passes through the copper bars and induces an electric current which is sent out onto the transmission system as the magnetic field has a north and south pole the copper bars experience a change in direction of the magnetic field each time the rotor turns this makes the electric current change direction twice per revolution and is called an alternating current ac there are in fact three sets of copper bars in the stator producing three electrical outputs or phases termed red yellow and blue electrical frequency is the measure of the rate of that oscillation and is measured in the number of changes per second  also called hertz hz a generator running at 3000 rpm  with two magnetic poles produces electricity at a frequency of 50hz why is this important maintaining a consistent electrical frequency is important because multiple frequencies cannot operate alongside each other without damaging equipment this has serious implications when providing electricity at a national scale the exact figure is less important than the need to keep frequency stable across all connected systems in great britain the grid frequency is 50hz in the us its 60hz in japan the western half of the country runs at 60hz and the eastern half of the country runs at 50hz  a string of power stations across the middle of the country steps up and down the frequency of the electricity as it flows between the two grids sticking to one national frequency is a team effort every generator in england scotland and wales connected to the high voltage transmission system is synchronised to every other generator when the output of any of the three phases  the red yellow or blue  is at a peak the output from all other phases of the same colour on every other generating unit in great britain is also at a peak they are all locked together  synchronised  to form a single homogenous supply which provides stability and guaranteed quality how is frequency managed the problem is frequency can be difficult to control  if the exact amount of electricity being used is not matched by generation it can affect the frequency of the electricity on the grid for example if theres more demand for electricity than there is supply frequency will fall if there is too much supply frequency will rise to make matters more delicate theres a very slim margin of error in great britain anything just 1 above or below the standard 50hz risks damaging equipment and infrastructure  see how far the countrys frequency is currently deviating from 50 hz  managing electrical frequency falls to a countrys high voltage transmission system operator the national grid in the uk the grid can instruct power generators like drax to make their generating units automatically respond to changes in frequency if the frequency rises the turbine reduces its steam flow if it falls it will increase changing the electrical output  a change that needs to happen in seconds in the case of generating units at drax power station the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension which minimises large frequency swings frequency on a fastchanging system not all power generation technologies are suited for providing high quality frequency response roles and as the uk transitions to a lowercarbon economy ancillary services such as stabilisation of frequency are becoming more important neither solar nor wind can be as easily controlled its possible to regulate wind output down or hold back wind turbines to enable upward frequency response when there is sufficient wind similarly solar panels can be switched on and off to simulate frequency response as solar farms are so widely dispersed and tend to be embedded  meaning they operate outside of the national system it is not as easy for national grid to instruct and monitor them both wind and solar have no inertia so the allimportant damping effect is missing too using these intermittent or weatherdependent power generation technologies to help manage frequency can be expensive compared to thermal power stations nor are the current fleet of nuclear reactors flexible  nuclear reactors in great britain were designed to run continuously at high loads known as a baseload power although they cannot deliver frequency response services the countrys nuclear power stations do provide inertia twenty times faster thermal power generation technologies such as renewable biomass or fossil fuels such as coal and gas are ideal for frequency response services at scale because they can be easily dialled up or down as both the fuel supply to their boilers and steam within their turbines can be regulated the 645 mw thermal power units at drax have the capability to respond to the grids needs in as little as half a second or less complete their change in output in under one second and maintain their response for many minutes or even hours before the introduction of high volumes of wind and solar generation almost all generators excluding nuclear running on the system could provide frequency response as these generators are increasingly replaced by intermittent technologies the system operator must look for new services to maintain system stability an example is national grids recent enhanced frequency response tender which asked for a solution that can deliver frequency stabilisation in under a second  20 times faster than the primary response provided by existing thermal power stations drax was the only participating thermal power station however all contracts were all won by battery storage projects frequency future given the decline in fossil fuel generation and uncertainty around our power makeup in future decades national grid is consulting on how best to source services such as frequency response the ideal scenario for national grid is one where services can be increasingly sourced from reliable flexible and affordable forms of low carbon generation or demand response the next generation of nuclear power stations as with some already operating in france can provide frequency response services however the first of the new crop hinkley c is around a decade away from being operational  likewise solar or wind coupled with battery molten salt or flywheel storage will provide an increasing level of flexibility in the decades ahead as storage costs come down thanks to power generation at drax with compressed wood pellets  a form of sustainable biomass britain has already begun moving into an era where lower carbon frequency response can begin to form the foundation of a more reliable and cleaner system this

2017 electrification britains electricity network is a lot like its roads for long distance highspeed journeys the road network has motorways  the electricity networks equivalent is the national grid  which transfers power across the country at extremely high voltages between 400000132000 volts and high speeds for shorter journeys at progressively lower speeds the traffic network has a and b roads these are the regional distribution networks these regional distribution networks take power at 132000 volts and transform it down in stages to 230 volts and make the link from the national grid to local distribution systems that deliver electricity to homes and businesses and while these a and b roads of electricity may be one of the most important parts of getting electricity from power station to plug very few people spare them any thought electricity in the north west when the government first privatised the electricity network in 1989  it set up different distribution regions to provide national coverage through a series of similarlysized regions says pete emery senior director of electricity north west  today each part of the uk is served by one of 14 different regional networks and in the north west across the pennines from where drax power station operates in north yorkshire thats the job of electricity north west it was formed in 1995 and today delivers around 23 terawatts of power to 22 million homes and 200000 business every year it does that using a vast network of more than 13000 km of overhead cables 44000 km of underground cables making it the second most underground electricity network in the uk behind london and more than 34000 transformers which work to convert the electricity from transmission voltage to one that can be used in uk homes  the scale of infrastructure needed to create these regional networks mean that each one is a natural monopoly in this case its a monopoly that benefits customers a natural monopoly a natural monopoly is when the cost of duplicating the assets needed to provide the service outweighs the benefits of efficiency that having competition would provide explains emery so it is in the public interest to have only one provider for decades each regional distribution network has operated the same way delivering power consistently to uk homes but as the country moves into the future of cleaner more sustainable energy  these grids are changing rapidly the potential proliferation of battery technologies and the increasing variation of power sources and their demands on the grid mean changes are in store for distributors like electricity north west one such factor already having an effect is embedded generation across the country there are sources of electricity generation that arent connected to regional distribution networks  for example private solar panels on domestic roofs wind turbines on private land or smallscale power stations connected to a single private distribution network and when there is excess electricity generated from these sources it can be sold back to electricity suppliers in the north west this embedded generation is fed back into emerys network in our region alone we have 2200 mw of embedded generation  more than half the capacity of drax power station  which means we already manage and control the power this input brings to the electricity system says emery they are invisible to national grid this is a radical change and its happening now regardless of whats to come whats certain is therell be traffic on the a roads of electricity tags electricity  energy policy  national grid these three inches of copper can power a city 17 january 2017 electrification a series of unassuming cables extend out of the turbine hall at drax power station  theyre easily missed but these few inches of copper play an instrumental role in powering your home surging through each one is enough electricity to power a city but the process of getting electricity from power station to plug isnt as simple as connecting one wire to a live turbine and another to your iphone charger we need an entire network of power stations cables and transformers linking the network when the country first became electrified it did so in stages each region of the uk was powered by its own selfcontained power supply that changed in 1926 when the uk set up the central electricity board and began what was at the time the biggest construction project britain had ever seen the national grid the project took 100000 men and five years to complete and when it was finished it connected 122 of the countrys most efficient power stations via 4000 miles of overhead cabling it had a sizeable effect in 1920 there were roughly 750000 electricity consumers by 1938 that had risen to 9 million the grid has changed in the 80 years thats passed but it remains the network that transfers power across the country to where its needed whenever its needed the strange thing about electricity is that you could live 10 miles from a power station and you cant be sure the electricity youre using is coming from that station says callan masters an engineer with national grid whose job it is to maintain and upgrade the network the whole system works together  the whole system has a demand and the whole system has to deliver it and to do this the network has to be able to deliver electricity quickly and efficiently masters explains it acts like a motorway for power riding the motorway for power the process of transporting electricity involves a series of stages the first of which is stepping up the voltage when electricity is transported via cables or wires it loses some of its energy as heat think of a lightbulb  as it illuminates it heats up because its losing energy the lower the current of that electricity however the less energy is lost so to reduce these losses when transporting power national grid transmits electricity at low currents which it can do by increasing its voltage at the power station electricity is generated at 23500 volts and is then stepped up to 400000 volts by a transformer the first of these is located on a substation on site at the power station once stepped up the electricity is transported through high transmission cables  before being stepped down via a transformer on the other end this stepped down electricity is passed onto a regional distribution system such as the overhead cables you might find on top of wooden poles before being stepped down a final time thats the role of a little transformer at the end of your street masters explains finally the electricity is transported via a final cable into your home  this time at 230 volts all this needs to happen incredibly quickly as thousands of kettles are switched on to herald the end of eastenders  the demand of electricity surges delivering that electricity at the touch of a button relies on a complex network but it starts with those inconspicuous few inches of

electrification late into the evening of christmas day 2016 millions of people sat down to watch rowan atkinson solve a grisly murder it was the tv drama maigrets dead man and although it wasnt the most watched tv show on christmas day that honour went to the strictly come dancing finale it did cause the biggest televisionrelated sudden surge in electricity demand of the day says sumit gumber energy forecasting analyst at national grid  during a critical ad break in the show demand jumped 400 mw  roughly equivalent to 160000 kettles being switched on  as viewers raced to make cups of tea or go to the bathroom this is known as a tv pickup  while this may have provided the biggest sudden rise in electricity usage of the day it was not the overall peak as is typical on christmas day this years spike in demand came just before one oclock when families were preparing their festive feasts at 371 gw this peak was not only lower than previous years the power used to supply it was generated by more renewables than any christmas before it more than 40 of the electricity generated on christmas day came from renewable sources  what characterises christmas day christmas is a day when electricity usage is at one of its lowest points to put this years 371 gw peak into context an average weekday during december weekday electricity use is higher than on weekends has an electricity peak of nearly 50 gw usually occurring between five and seven oclock when people arrive home and street lighting is switched on the cause for the lower demand during christmas is simple  over the festive period schools as well as a number of offices shops and factories are closed over the last few years average christmas day demand has been fairly typical sitting in a bracket of between 29 gw and 39 gw in 2010 however extreme cold hitting minus three degrees celsius drove lunchtime peak demand as high as 46 gw showing just how important a driver of our electricity use temperature is  but while demand on christmas in 2016 may not have deviated largely from the average over the last few years there were some major leaps forward in how it was generated a greener christmas than ever before this year christmas was characterised by a huge jump in renewable electricity generation  on average 124 gw came from renewable sources  more than ever before of that figure wind contributed the most generating on average 94 gw  equivalent to 31 of all power supplied on christmas day compared to 2015 its a 63 increase and a staggering 195 uplift from five christmases ago in 2012 when just 12 of all electricity generated came from renewable sources biomass generation has also increased providing 2 gw in 2016 compared to the 05 gw it averaged on december 25 th  2012 the increase in renewables also marks an important step towards decarbonisation at its peak emissions from electricity generation this 25 th december were just 168 gkwh a significant drop compared to the 2012 peak of

great technological innovations need infrastructure to match the world didnt change from candles to lightbulbs overnight  power stations had to be built electricity cables rolled out and buildings fitted with wiring the same is true of electric vehicles ev think of the number of petrol stations lining the uk roads if evs continue their rise in popularity the country will need electric carcharging facilities to augment and then replace these petrol stations this could mean big extensions of electricity grid infrastructure both in the building of new power generation capacity to meet demand and in the extension of the networks themselves in short it could mean a significant change in how electricity is used and supplied the need for better electricity infrastructure in 2013 only 3500 of newly registered cars in the uk were plugin electric or hybrid evs in 2016 that number jumped to 63000 their use is rising rapidly but the lack of infrastructure has kept a cap on the number of evs on uk roads that is starting to change as of 2019 all new and refurbished houses in the eu will have to be fitted with an electric car charging point  according to a draft directive announced by brussels the uk will probably no longer be an eu member by the time the directive comes into effect but nevertheless the uk government is pursuing its own ways to account for the rise of evs it has pledged more than 600 million between 2015 and 2020 to support ultralowemission vehicles  38 million of this has already been earmarked for public charging points there are more innovative responses to ev rise too nissan in partnership with italian energy provider enel has announced it will install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk with their innovative v2g technology  cars plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary so when there is a peak in demand the grid could access the cars stored energy to help meet it the total capacity of the 18000 nissan electric vehicles currently operational on uk roads comes to around 180 mw so even today  before electric vehicles have really taken off  this could give the national grid an additional supply roughly the size of a small power station peaks in electricity demand however tend to occur in the late afternoon or evening as it gets dark and more lighting and heating gets switched on this also happens to be rush hour so under this scheme the time of day the cars are most likely to be on the roads is also when itd be most helpful to have them plugged in this could lead to financial incentives for people to give up the flexibility of driving their cars only when they need to more electric cars more demand for electricity more pollution more evs on the road makes sound environmental sense  they enable a 40 reduction in co2 emissions  but ultimately the energy still has to come from somewhere that means more power stations the scale of this new demand shouldnt be underestimated if european drivers were to go 80 electric some studies have suggested it would require 150 gw of additional ondemand capacity  the equivalent of 40 draxsized power stations but if evs are to live up to their green potential that additional power needs to come from innovations in storage such as in the nissan example and from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass fossil fuels would ideally be used only to plug any gaps that intermittency creates  for example by briefly firing up the small gas power stations drax plans to build in england and wales what does this mean for generators drax as operator of the uks largest biomass power station and with plans for new rapid response open cycle gas turbines ocgts is well placed to be at the forefront of providing reliable affordable power in the event of a widespread rollout of electric vehicles the ocgts in particular are designed for use in peak times which in

extreme nonetheless britain has had a contingency plan in place for decades britains ultimate power back up first things first  if the whole of the network including the power stations supplying the national high voltage electricity distribution network the grid loses power you would need to restart those individual power stations before they can get the grid powered up again the challenge normally all power stations need electrical supply to start up but with a total electricity blackout theres no electricity to restart the system thats why the reboot procedure is called black start  and its one the most important yet littleknown back up plans in the uk the good news there has never been a blackout so widespread that drax has been asked to do a black start preparing for the unlikely but thats not to say that such a procedure may never be needed in october 1987 there was a regional black start in the wake of the powerful hurricane that hit the south of the country the storm damage left kent and sussex disconnected from the national grid  but thanks to black start contingency plans most people barely noticed kingsnorth power station restored power to the area and it ran independently cut off from the rest of the grid until repairs enabled it to be connected up again a total nationwide grid blackout may be unlikely but that doesnt mean its not prepared for tests happen regularly to assess how long it would take to restart an individual generation unit at a major power station bring it up to capacity and make sure that any black start would run smoothly the most recent test took place at drax in july 2011 with representatives from the national grid witnessing the procedure to simulate blackout conditions three of the generating units were disconnected from the grid in that test it took 83 minutes to return one unit back to service a simple plan not all power stations can do a black start  some simply do not have control ability to be the starting point of a system reboot but modern coal gas and biomass power plants are able to restart rapidly on demand this is why drax  first operational in the 1970s  is modern and responsive enough to be a key part of todays black start planning the way it works is actually relatively simple using smaller power sources to start ever bigger ones scaling up and up until the entire country is powered up again draxs auxiliary generating units consist of three gas turbines which can be started from batteries these would in turn generate enough power to restart one or two main generating units the restarted generating units would be used as the backbone of an island network  a network operating independently of the national grid  that would be grown by adding pockets of supply the generating units would match the speed and frequency to create normal grid conditions and to restore supplies fast locally finally the affected areas island networks would be hooked up to each other so electricity can be distributed around the country with the reliability and stability we have become accustomed to staying prepared when the electricity market was privatised there was a risk that such nationwide plans as black start could have fallen apart to prevent this formal contracts were put in place to continue to restart from scratch if necessary drax recently renewed its contract this makes black start  and drax  as important as ever if a disaster scenario ever struck for real the most important back up plan youd never heard of until now will swing into action this short story is
