Drax boosts STEM skills with new Daldowie apprentices
Drax’s apprenticeship scheme has been running for over 15 years at its North Yorkshire power station, and since it acquired a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable generating assets, some of which are in Scotland, it has sought to extend the scheme to other locations.
16 December 2019
Two apprentices are kick starting their careers with Drax after the company extended its apprenticeship scheme to budding engineers across Scotland.
Drax is continuing its commitment to STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills by offering apprenticeships at its Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute, Galloway hydro power scheme and the Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow.
Danielle Nicholson, aged 19 from East Kirkbride, has joined Drax’s Daldowie energy from waste plant as a technical apprentice. She said: “I thought that finding engineering jobs in the area might be difficult, so it was great to hear about the opportunity at Daldowie. Renewable energy’s a really exciting industry to be in, especially now with all the focus on climate change.”
Gregor Fraser, aged 19, from Dunbartonshire, said of his new apprenticeship at the Daldowie energy from waste plant:
“
An apprenticeship made the most sense to me as it gives the sort of practical experience you can’t get at university. Drax is well known for its engineering, so I’m really excited to be starting my career with the company, learning new skills and getting some good experience here.”
Both Gregor and Danielle will be working at Daldowie once they have completed formal training at East Kilbride Group Training Association (EKGTA).

Andy Koss, CEO Generation said:
“To be able to open up new opportunities for apprentices in Scotland is a really proud moment for us. It demonstrates our commitment to education and skills, as well as our dedication to our workforce and the future of these new Drax sites.
“The energy sector is experiencing unprecedented change with Drax right at the forefront of it. We’re going to continue to need talented, hard-working young people to help us deliver the changes needed to meet the UK’s net zero carbon ambitions. As we’ve seen with our apprentices elsewhere, supporting ambitious young people to develop their skills is critical to the ongoing success of our business.”
Drax’s technical apprenticeship scheme
gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers. It is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.
Drax offers apprenticeships in business support areas too, such as Finance and Business Administration, as well as engineering.
All opportunities are advertised on its website
.
This year’s apprentices at Drax’s Scottish operations are:
Danielle Nicholson (19) who will be working at Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow
Gregor Fraser (19) who will be working at Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow
Iain MacPherson (17) who will be working at Cruachan pumped hydro power station, Argyll and Bute
Joshua Smith (24) who will be working at Cruachan pumped hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute
Ryan Connelly (19) who will be working at Galloway hydro power scheme.

Editor’s Notes
Drax has a longstanding commitment to STEM learning, with around 55,000 visits to Cruachan Power Station each year. Drax offers free educational tours, these range from primary school pupils to degree level students. All visits can be tailored to the level of the visiting school, college or university.
It is also
investing to help boost educational skills
by working closely with local schools and colleges to encourage STEM learning.
Drax’s power station in North Yorkshire recently announced it was hiring
a record-number of
new apprentices with thirteen joining the company.

About Drax
Drax Group’s ambition is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,600-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
Customers:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
