Electricity Supply Pension Scheme Privacy Notice

Electricity Supply Pension Scheme Privacy Notice
Electricity Supply Pension Scheme Privacy Notice
We, the Trustees of the Drax Power Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) ‘the Group’ will use your personal information to assess, administer and pay any benefits you may be entitled to under the rules of the Drax Power Group.
As part of the service we provide we may share your information with other organisations for the purposes of identifying accurate information as to your whereabouts or for the purpose of paying any benefits that you may be entitled to. We will handle your data in compliance with all relevant data protection legislation, including from May 2018 in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Trustees of the Group are the data controller (a person who determines the purposes for which any personal data is processed) in respect of your personal information for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation. As data controller the Trustees are responsible for determining the purpose and the means for processing your personal information.
Purpose of using information
We process personal information for the reasons/purposes above. This information may include:
personal details
family, lifestyle and social circumstances
financial details
employment and education details
goods or services provided
We may also need to process special category of information, such as physical or mental health details, in order to administer ill-health retirement payments and applications.
This information may be obtained from your employer, ex-employer, government agencies, service providers or from yourself.
We will only collect and use your personal information where:
there is a legal obligation for us to do so;
it is for our legitimate business interests; or
you have given us your consent to do so.
Our legitimate business interests include fulfilling our role in dealing with, assessing eligibility for and paying any benefits you may be entitled to. We will not use your data for our legitimate business interests if they are overridden by your interests, rights or freedoms.
You do not have to provide the information requested from you, but there may be a delay in the payment of your benefits if that information is not provided.
If we are processing your personal information on the basis of your consent you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting RPMI EPAL ( (contact details shown under further information).  The withdrawal of consent will not affect the processing of personal data carried out before consent was withdrawn.
Who the information may be shared with
From time to time we may need to share your information with other organisations. Where this is necessary we will comply with all relevant aspects of data protection legislation.
Your information will be shared with RPMI EPAL (Electricity Pensions Administration Limited) in order for them to provide pension administration services in line with the reasons/purposes outlined above.
The types of other organisations we may need to share some of your information with are:
claimants, beneficiaries, assignees (those assigned to administer benefits) and payees
pension schemes with which the person whose personal information we are processing has an association
Business associates and professional advisers
healthcare, social and welfare organisations
financial organisations and advisers
central and local government
service providers
ombudsmen and regulatory authorities
suppliers
family, associates or representatives of the person whose personal data we are processing
tracing agencies
Retention of data
One of the key principles of the relevant data protection legislations that the personal data we store and process shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purpose it was originally collected. Our standard policy is for information or data to be kept for only as long as necessary. It is then disposed of in a managed and secure way. However, as pensions are a long term saving vehicle it may be necessary to retain your personal data for the remainder of your life and any dependants’ lives in order to pay you the benefits you are entitled to along with any dependant’s benefits payable.
Our core systems, data, and administration services are all carried out and stored within the UK.
Completing forms on behalf of a child
If you are completing forms, on behalf of a child we may also hold and use
your
personal information, which will be dealt with on the same basis as set out above.
Your rights
You have a number of rights under data protection legislation. These include the right to:
see the information we hold about you;
request personal data to be amended if it is inaccurate or incomplete;
request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued use;
to block or restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances; and
object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances
There is also a right to receive your personal data (in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format) and to transfer your data to another service provider or data controller. This right applies where your data is being processed on the basis of your consent or in line with a contract to which you are party. Please note that for the majority of members, this is not applicable as we rely on our legitimate business interest to collect and process your data rather than individual consent or contracts.
Further information

If you wish to exercise any of your rights or have concerns about the processing of your (or on behalf of the child in whose name this claim is made), personal information including in relation to the use of it by the Trustees or RPMI EPAL, please contact RPMI EPAL

If you are unhappy with how your personal information is being handled you also have the right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent body set up to uphold information rights, which will investigate your complaint.
Appendix (1)
Aon Hewitt Limited “QUICK READ” PRIVACY NOTICE
Aon Hewitt Limited (and, where appointed, the Scheme Actuary – together “Aon”) has been appointed to provide pensions advisory and calculation services that relate to your membership of the pension scheme. In doing so Aon will use personal information about you, such as your name and contact details, information about your pension contributions, age of retirement, and in some limited circumstances information about your health (where this impacts your retirement age) in order to be able to provide these services. The purposes for which we use personal information will include management of the pension scheme and your membership within it, funding the pension scheme (i.e. helping to ensure that the funds within the pension scheme are sufficient to cover the members who are party to it), liability management (that is to say providing advice on the different ways benefits could be determined, and drawn, from the pension scheme), scheme actuary duties (which include assessing individuals who are members of the pension scheme and assessing how the make-up of the membership may affect the amounts payable and when they become payable so as to manage the pension scheme appropriately), regulatory compliance, process and service improvement and benchmarking.
We may pass your personal information to third parties such as financial advisors and benefits providers, insurers, our affiliates and service providers and to certain regulatory bodies where legally required to do so.  Depending on the circumstances, this may involve a transfer of data outside the UK and the European Economic Area to countries that have less robust data protection laws. Any such transfer will be made with appropriate safeguards in place.
More detail about Aon’s use of your personal information is set out in our full Privacy Notice.  We recommend that you review this notice which is available online
