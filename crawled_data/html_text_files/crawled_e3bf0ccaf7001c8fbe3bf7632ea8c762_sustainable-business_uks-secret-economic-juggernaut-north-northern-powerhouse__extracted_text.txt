september 2017 sustainable business the north of england is home to some 15 million people this makes up almost a quarter of the uks total population and includes a mesh of proud local identities compared to the rest of the uk however there is a persistent gap in gva gross value added per capita and productivity performance  analysis by the treasury claimed that if the norths economy grew as quickly as the uk average to 2030 its economic output would be 37 billion higher in real terms  theres huge potential in north but it needs the right support to unlock it the northern powerhouse partnership is a businessled organisation aiming to do just that in a new report powerhouse 2050 transforming the north  it explores four areas of the economy originally identified in the northern powerhouse independent economic review  where the north has the potential to be a world leader within the next 33 years given the right cooperation between business university and government investment these four sectors could create 850000 more jobs and contribute an extra 100 billion to the uk economy by 2050 new extra large press starts production at nissan sunderland via nissan europe newsroom advanced manufacturing and materials the north has a strong history in manufacturing from traditional steel production in sheffield to shipbuilding in hull the region is currently home to several car manufacturing plants including vauxhall jaguar land rover and nissan building on this pedigree the norths real strengths lie in its ability to improve processes and productivity as well as the development of new products two key areas where it could be a world leader heading into 2050 are new lightweight and 2d materials as well as highprecision engineering close connections between research institutions and manufacturing industries will help provide businesses in the region with access to cutting edge technology and the highlyskilled workforce needed to operate it siemens and drax engineers worked together to upgrade turbines at drax power station the fiveyear 100m project was completed in 2012  find out more  energy the north has a long history of powering the uk and today still generates 41 of englands electricity building on this strength in the field the region has the potential to evolve into a world leader in the modern lowcarbon energy sector through the repurposing of existing infrastructure such as drax power stations transition from coal to biomass fuel  the north is uniquely placed to deliver the uks energy needs said drax power ceo andy koss there are huge opportunities for us as a region  not just in terms of potential jobs and the economic benefits  but also the positive environmental impacts associated with decarbonisation electricity generation storage and low carbon technologies including nuclear offshore wind and bioenergy are already well established in the north however there are also opportunities to reuse existing infrastructure such as greening the gas grid in leeds by converting it to low carbon hydrogen digital the digital and tech sectors are often seen as a major driver for wellpaid jobs that can drive national productivity and the wider economy and while london remains the central hub for venture capital funding and highprofile startups a report by tech nation found almost 70 of total investment in tech went to companies outside the capital in 2016 this includes 78 million raised by manchester tech businesses and 61 million invested in sheffield companies in fact the wider digital sector from adtech to fintech now employs 168671 people across city clusters in the north  this is a strong base from which to grow the regions tech and digital scene which will be supported by initiatives such as the 400 million northern powerhouse investment fund and the 30 million for the regions new national innovation centre for data health innovation the north has longestablished strengths in fields such as life sciences medical technologies and devices these include pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing hubs across the region what makes the uk unique in the health innovation space is its ability to leverage the national health service as an asset for research innovation and in developing new models of healthcare delivery  and the north is no different this collaboration can allow companies and institutions in the field to sit at the forefront of implementing and developing treatments medicines and devices for the 21 st century the future of health innovation will be closely connected to tech fields of big data and ai and these along with other types of research will require close collaboration between businesses the nhs and the regions universities within the relatively small uk the north may still be a small part often eclipsed by the countrys capital but as the report shows there is not only huge potential yet to be realised but a strong history on which to build
