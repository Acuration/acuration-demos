schoolchildren rise to draxs recycled robot challenge the robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal or builtin compartments to store paper 12 july 2021 primary school pupils have built their own robots from recycled materials as part of an initiative developed by drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to boost stem education and skills the visitor centre team at drax power station has worked with colleagues at doncaster college and university centre to develop the stem box project an engaging activity for students to take part in relating to the subject areas of science technology engineering and maths a group of students aged between seven and ten at sunnyfields primary school in scawthorpe have been provided with individual activity boxes containing a range of learning materials games and resources they will need to build their robots the focus of which is on recycling and forms part of their school curriculum during the covid19 lockdown many pupils have struggled to engage with homeschooling and projects like the stem box provide a valuable opportunity to transition back into the school routine and get students enthusiastic about learning again the robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal or builtin compartments to store paper students also received a video recorded by the visitor centre guides to provide them with instructions once covid restrictions are relaxed they intend to deliver this introduction in person in schools as well as providing a visit to the power station as part of the project to help students understand the important role that recycling plays there drax groups head of sustainable business alan knight said by providing schools with these resources we hope to further students understanding of the importance of recycling and hopefully fire up their imaginations and inspire them to study stem subjects by showing them the wide range of career options that are available liane clark from childrens university at doncaster college said childrens university cu are excited to share this fantastic project with our cu schools to create an enriching learning experience that will inspire our future working generation our partnership with drax has enabled a unique learning opportunity which we hope will encourage children to deepen their knowledge and have a positive impact on their future children at sunnyfields primary school are the first to take part in the project which the drax power station visitor centre team plan to roll out to other schools across the region after the summer holidays teacher chloe hoogwerf said the students had a great time taking part in the stem box programme learning about drax and building the recycling robots activities like these are so important as it really brings the subject to life and gets students enthusiastic about stem as well as encouraging them to start thinking about careers they might enjoy in the future drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the next generation of engineers by encouraging interest in stem subjects earlier this year drax announced its mobilising a million ambition which aims to increase social mobility and provide levelling up opportunities for a million people by 2025 as well as the stem box project during the covid pandemic drax launched a virtual work experience programme renewed its partnership with selby college with a 180000 contribution to support skills and training and provided over 1200 laptops with free internet access to school pupils across the country to ensure that students dont miss out on valuable learning

electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working
