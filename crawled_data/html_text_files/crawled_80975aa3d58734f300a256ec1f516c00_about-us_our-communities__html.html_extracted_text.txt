Our Communities

Our communities
At Drax, we want to make a real, positive difference in the communities and regions where we operate. We have a long history of engaging with a range of local stakeholders, from civil society organisations to parish councils and Chambers of Commerce. This year, we have strengthened our approach to supporting our communities, which encompasses active community engagement and local stakeholder relations, and a refreshed approach to philanthropic giving with the launch of the new Drax Foundation. At the heart of this approach is a commitment to being a good neighbour and playing a positive role in our communities.
Corporate Giving
Effective corporate giving is a key pillar of our community approach and reflects Drax’s commitment to being a good neighbour and making a positive contribution in the communities where we operate. We run a grant-giving programme and make charitable donations via the Drax Foundation, and the Drax Community Fund in the UK, US, and Canada. This mirrors Drax’s operational footprint.
The Drax Foundation
The Drax Foundation was established in 2023 to provide grant funding for non-profit organisations and social enterprises that deliver lasting socio-economic impact in the heart of our communities. We prioritise organisations that demonstrate an in-depth understanding of local conditions, and who represent the diversity of our communities. We disburse grants in the range of £10,000 – £50,000.
The Drax Foundation is a donor advised fund administered by Charities Trust (an independently registered charity with the UK Charity Commission, Charity No. 327489).
Drax Foundation focus areas
The Drax Foundation has two primary focus areas, which are underpinned by a cross-cutting commitment to advancing diversity, equality, equity and inclusion – particularly in relation to gender equality, indigenous communities, and underserved groups.
STEM education and skills development
Enhancing biodiversity and green spaces in local communities
Cross-cutting
Advancing gender equality
Supporting underserved groups and indigenous communities
The Drax Foundation is also committed to making a measurable contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have prioritized eight intersecting SDGs and will report annually on the contributions we are making to these Global Goals.
Applications to the Drax Foundation

The Drax Foundation welcomes expressions of interest (EoI) from eligible organizations. Please review our

Drax Community Fund

– local direct giving
In addition to the Drax Foundation, we also operate the Drax Community Fund. This Fund makes smaller donations to local projects in the communities where Drax operates. The funding is designed to be accessible and make a tangible difference in our local communities. Donations typically range from £500 – £2,000. Contact

[email protected]

for more information.
Examples

of direct giving
Providing laptops for learners in Selby, UK
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Drax supported Selby High School to buy new laptops that enabled students to continue their studies from home during extended periods of lockdown in the UK.
Replanting hurricane-damaged land in Louisiana, US
In the aftermath of hurricanes and tornados affecting Monroe, Louisiana, we provided funding for local non-profit, Ouachita Green, to support community improvement and re-planting efforts in Ouachita Parish.
Sponsoring the Summer Games in British Columbia, Canada
As part of our commitment to support community activities in and around our operations in British Columbia (BC), we supported the BC Summer Games, which is one of Prince George’s largest sporting events.
Communities in Crisis Fund
Our Communities in Crisis Fund provides emergency aid in response to natural disasters, conflict, and other humanitarian crises. Most recently, this Fund has supported the Turkey- Syria earthquake appeal.

Example donations from Drax’s Communities in Crisis Fund
Helping communities affected by hurricane damage in Louisiana, US
Our support helped with food assistance for vulnerable people whose homes were destroyed of severely damaged by hurricane Laura in 2020.
Helping the most vulnerable people impacted by flood damage in North Yorkshire, UK
Funding for the Two Ridings Community Foundation to help local communities surrounding the Drax Power Station, whose homes and businesses were flooded in 2020.
Providing humanitarian support for the war in Ukraine
Funding for the humanitarian aid effort in response to the on-going war in Ukraine. As a sign of support, we also lit up the cooling towers at the Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire with the colours of the Ukrainian flag.
“Two Ridings Community Foundation provides vital support to local community groups and small charities. These grassroots projects are largely overlooked by national funders and often struggle to continue their invaluable work. With your support, we can reach the most vulnerable in our community and make a real difference to people’s lives.”
Jan Garrill, CEO of the Two Ridings Community Foundation
Skylark Nature Centre and Reserve, run by the Drax UK Community Team
