with free internet access to the school last year to ensure students having to learn from home during the covid19 pandemic did not fall behind in their studies since march 2020 selby high school has loaned out over 500 laptops to families to support students with home learning and after seeing the positive impact this has had the school intends to allow their students to keep the devices and to issue additional laptops to support the educational needs of even more pupils drax has offered a fiveyear financial support package to cover the cost and maintenance of 50 new laptops a year adding up to a total value of over 70000 across the five years draxs group director of sustainability alan knight said we work closely with schools in our communities to ensure that young people from all backgrounds have equal access to education drax has an important part to play in making sure the next generation has the knowledge and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow our partnership with selby high school builds on the work we did during lockdown to provide laptops with free internet access to ensure no students were left behind in their studies as well as virtual tours of the power station and online work experience so that students didnt miss out on the opportunities drax would usually offer selby high school principal nick hinchcliffe said the generous donation from drax has really allowed us to move a step closer to our goal of ensuring that every student at selby high school has access to technology at home this will have a huge benefit for some of our most vulnerable learners and particularly allow us to make sure that any gaps in learning caused by the pandemic are quickly closed drax is committed to supporting the

and storage ccus project flythrough video of beccs facility at drax power station released to support public consultation drax is advancing its plans to deliver vital negative emissions technology by beginning a major planning consultation that will seek the views of the public on its proposals to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at the drax power station site in north yorkshire the announcement follows the publication of the governments net zero strategy which outlined how vital engineered greenhouse gas removal ggr technologies such as beccs could be in delivering on the uks decarbonisation ambitions the strategy also stated that beccs could achieve ambitious contributions towards the uks 2030 climate change target supported by significant deployment of mature beccs technology from the late 2020s in addition the announcement follows news that the east coast cluster a collaboration between zero carbon humber net zero teesside and the northern endurance partnership which plans to create the uks first net zero industrial cluster has received government backing drax is an anchor project in the east coast cluster and the commencement of its planning consultation marks the first major action from a project in the cluster both the humber and teesside account for almost half of the uks industrial co2 emissions and decarbonising these regions will have the biggest impact on the uks ability to reach its legally binding net zero target draxs beccs technology will permanently remove 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year accelerate economic growth for the yorkshire and humber region and put the region at the heart of a global green economy the proposed scheme will also create and support over 10000 jobs in the humber and across the uk will gardiner drax group ceo said negative emissions technologies like beccs will play a vital role in tackling the climate crisis and the start of this consultation marks a significant milestone in our plans to deliver this innovative technology at our power station in yorkshire the governments recently stated ambition for beccs and backing for the east coast cluster further demonstrates the vital role drax can play in helping the uk reach its ambitious net zero targets as well as creating and protecting thousands of jobs in this country beccs at drax is a

it was the first school outing they have had the opportunity to go on due to long periods of learning from home during the pandemic gywneth beaumont teacher at camblesforth community primary academy said our pupils had a great time at the skylark centre the sessions were well planned and resourced and the children had a lot of fun while also learning so much in just one day they especially loved having marshmallows round the fire at the end the staff were amazing and looked after not only the children but the adults as well we will definitely be returning drax group head of sustainable

as the uk looks towards a zerocarbon future its also a clear endorsement of the vital role that drax will continue to play in helping the uk reach its net zero targets it highlights the significant contributions that both our negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and the expansion of our pumped storage hydro capacity could play in generating renewable energy in the uk for the uk whilst also addressing the climate crisis it is important that the government now advances its plans to develop business models for greenhouse gas removal technologies so as to enable companies like drax to invest in these and ensure their deployment in the 2020s background beccs at drax government proposals envisage that by 2030 significant deployment of mature beccs technologies will be required with retrofit applications in the power and industrial sectors beccs applications in the power sector could be deployed by the late 2020s and potentially achieve ambitious contributions to our ndc target by 2030 strategy stresses the need for engineered ggrs to deploy over the next decade with an estimated 23mt of co2 needed to be removed by 2035 and between

the last decade and drax is now one of europes lowest carbon energy generators cruachan expansion the strategy outlines flexibility and storage technologies as one of the three key pillars to support the decarbonisation of the power system alongside renewables and nuclear like draxs existing cruachan facility in argyll the new station will be able to provide lifeline stability services to the power system alongside acting like a giant water battery by using reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside the station can store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand the stored water would then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this will help to cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power the new station would have the capacity to generate enough power for around a million homes the new 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the new power station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side to the east of draxs existing 440mw pumped storage hydro station more than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station the existing upper reservoir which can hold 24 billion gallons of water has the capacity to serve both power stations if planning consent is given for the new power station the extra capacity could be available in 2030 alongside planning consent the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the lack of an existing framework for largescale longduration storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation the government recently issued a call for evidence to explore the need to provide further market intervention to support lles technologies drax group ceo will gardiner responds to track1 cluster announcement press releases will gardiner ceo drax group said todays government announcement is welcome news and a crucial
