great potential  not just for the transport industrys overall carbon footprint but for the populations of heavily congested polluted cities and even individual drivers looking for more efficient fuel costs that future is approaching fast by 2040 or even as soon as 2035 no new cars or vans sold in the uk can be solely powered by diesel or petrol while this is a positive step it brings with it a shift in the way drivers will need to manage the way they plan journeys and more importantly refuel for years drivers have relied on a quick and plentiful supply of fuel at petrol stations but an ev doesnt charge as quickly as a conventional car nor are fast charging points widespread  at least not right now the change will be considerable but it wont necessarily take shape in a single form here we look at four things that will become increasingly influential in how drivers recharge their evs over the coming years smart charging and timeofuse tariffs electricity costs more to produce and supply at certain times of the day this wholesale price depends on the demand for power weather conditions and the costs of different generation technologies and fuels for example electricity is often more expensive in the evenings when people are coming home from work and turning on lights tvs ovens and plugging in devices just a few hours later it rapidly drops in price as homes and offices turn off lights and appliances but the power system is changing  the price of electricity is increasingly driven by less predictable factors such as the weather on windy and sunny days wind and solar generation can drive down the cost of producing power on calm and cloudy days the costs of electricity can increase while this in theory makes it sensible to wait for a cheap period of time to plug in and charge an electric vehicle ev in practice people are unlikely to spend the time sit refreshing websites which display the price of electricity in real time to get the best value instead the use of smart charging technology can play a big role to capitalise on fluctuations in prices smart charging technology will be able to monitor things like electricity prices and even electricity usage across an entire site for example across a business where many devices are using electricity and automate the charging process to make use of the best prices and limit overall electricity use rather than needing someone to recharge evs at one oclock in the morning this means people or businesses can plug in at times convenient to them and set their vehicles to charge at the cheapest times and have an appropriate amount of charge to carry out tasks when they need to by shifting power usage into cheaper periods youre saving money and you can be more sympathetic to supply and demand limits on a company explains adam hall who leads draxs ev proposition if i know my battery will be fully charged by nine in the morning do i care if it charges immediately or delays it and saves me a few pounds for business fleet owners who manage large numbers of electric vehicles the difference this can make is even larger he adds vehicletogrid v2g technology each ev has a battery in it that powers the vehicles motor but what if the electricity stored in that battery could also be harnessed to deliver electricity back to grid and what if that concept could be used to collect a small portion of power from every idle ev in the country and use it to plug gaps in the electricity system there are over 30 million cars on uk roads national grid predicts by 2050 99 of those vehicles will be powered by electricity  explains hall the majority of cars remain idle for 95 of any day thats a huge amount of storage potential that could be used to balance the grid at key times  its a battery network that assets around the country will be able to use this concept is whats called vehicle to grid technology v2g and while it holds great potential its still some way from becoming a mainstream source of reserve power right now the technology is costly and limited  only chademo charging systems as found on japanese models actually support bidirectional charging nevertheless hall remains optimistic of its future role in the energy system particularly as this technology will be hugely important in managing future grid constraints the cost of bidirectional hardware is coming down all the time he says at the moment there arent enough vehicles we dont have the scale to do it but i fully believe it will change quite dramatically for domestic users the benefit will be less immediate than it will be for entire countries for business fleet managers allowing the grid to take some power from their idle vehicles could lead to financial compensation or other advantages for offering grid support the out of sight out of mind approach third party management schemes more suited for businesses managing whole fleets of vehicles employing a third party to manage the charging of vehicles allows for the delegation of a potentially costly and timeconsuming task adam hall drax ev proposition lead with draxs electric vehicle fleet service effectively the customer knows theyll get the vehicles with the amount of charge they want when they need it says hall that might be for the cheapest price or as fast as possible it means the customer doesnt have to think they just get their charged vehicle in the optimum way for their needs third party providers could also open up new charging businesses models such as flat monthly rates for unlimited vehicle charging or allrenewable services by taking the technical aspects of running a fleet out of businesses hands third parties could even serve to lower the barrier to ev adoption mandatory managed charging its difficult to accurately know how much demand electric vehicles will place on the electricity system  some estimates see demand growing in great britain as much as 22 by 2050 as a result of evs while the constant development of battery and charging technology will likely mean this prediction will come down there are some theories as to how the country will need to deal with this rapid growth one of these is to actually turn down the electricity surging through charging points at certain points to prevent widespread blackouts the idea is there to protect the grid explains hall when local distribution networks have a lot of demand they may need to turn charge points down he adds there will likely be exemptions for emergency services however hall is sceptical mandatory managed charging would ever really come into play for the damage it would do to consumer attitudes to evs the idea also taps into wider scaremongering around evs and quite how much they will push up electricity demand instead what will really need to shift for a future of efficiently charged vehicles is a mindset shift theres a psychological element to it he suggests everyone goes through some range anxiety at first but soon realises the technology is sound as battery technology continues to improve vehicles evolve to go further on a single charge and networks of superfast charge points expand transitioning to electric vehicles will become easier and more economical for businesses than continuing to depend on fossil fuel i personally believe once electric vehicles are doing 300 miles on a single charge the requirement for onroute charging will be pretty low says hall not many people drive 300 miles need to recharge at a service station and then drive anther 300 in one fell swoop its much more important to have good charging installations at work and at home there are many ways in which evs will change the way the world drives from how we charge them to how and where we travel we can be certain this will mean a shift in mindsets and our approach to transport  what remains uncertain is just how quickly and widespread that shift will be tags decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs  energy policy  transport how will 5g revolutionise the world of energy and communications 30 august 2019 electrification what should be made of the 5g gap its the difference between what some commentators are expecting to happen thanks to this new technology and what others perhaps more realistically believe is possible in the near future what we call 5g is the fifth generation of mobile communications following 4g 3g etc it promises vastly increased data download and upload speeds much improved coverage along with better connectivity this will bring with it lower latency  potentially as low as one millisecond a 90 per cent reduction on the equivalent time for 4g  and great news for traders and gamers along with lower unit costs trading desk at haven power ipswich the latest estimates predict that 5g will have an economic impact of 12 trillion by 2035 as mobile technology changes away from connecting people to other people and information and towards connecting us to everything  some experts believe the effects of 5g will be enormous and almost instantaneous transforming the way we live it will have a huge effect on the internet of things  for instance making it possible for us to live in a more instant much more connected world with more interactions with smart objects every day driverless cars that talk to the road and virtual and augmented reality to help us as we go could become part of our everyday lives  others see 5g as a revolution that will begin almost immediately but which could take many years to materialise  the principal reason for this is the sheer level of investment required the frequencies being used to carry the signal from the proposed 5g devices can provide an enormous amount of bandwidth and carry unimaginable amounts of data at incredible speeds but they cannot carry it very far and the volume of devices connected to this network will be enormous the bbc estimates that between 50 and 100 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2020  more than 12 for every single person on earth so in order to support the huge increase in connectivity that is anticipated a reality there will be a need for a comparably large increase in the number of base stations  with as many as 500000 more estimated to be needed in the uk alone thats around three times as many base stations as required for 4g to carry the amount of data anticipated without catastrophic losses in signal quality will require the stations to be no more than 500m apart while that may be technically possible in cities it will only happen as a result of huge amounts of investment and what will happen in the countryside with its lower population density it seems doubtful in the extreme that any corporation will regard it as a potentially profitable business decision to build a network of base stations half a kilometre apart in areas where few of their customers live and thats without taking into account the town and country planning system or the views of residents who may not welcome new base stations near their homes until this year the only two workable examples of functional 5g networks are one built by samsung in seoul south korea and another by huawei in moscow in advance of the 2020 football world cup although the first uk mobile networks have now begun to offer the new communications standard 5g is still clearly a long way from being able to deliver on its potential what will 5g mean for the world of energy a report from accenture contains a number of predictions about how 5g may change the energy world by helping to increase energy efficiency overall and accelerating the development of the smart grid 5g uses less power than previous generations of wireless technology this means that less energy will be used for each individual connection which will take less time to complete than with 4g devices thereby saving energy and ultimately money too it is important to remember that even though such savings will be significant they will need to be offset against the huge global increase in communications through 5gconnected devices accelerating the smart grid to improve forecasting 5g has the potential to help us manage energy generation and transmission more efficiently and therefore more costeffectively the reports authors anticipate that by allowing many unconnected energyconsuming devices to be integrated into the grid through lowcost 5g connections 5g enables these devices to be more accurately monitored to support better forecasting of energy needs improve demand side management and reduce costs by connecting these energyconsuming devices using a smart grid demandside management will be further enhanced to support load balancing helping reduce electricity peaks and ultimately energy costs manage energy infrastructure more efficiently and reduce downtime by sharing data about energy use through 5g connections the new technology can help ensure that spending on energy infrastructure is managed more efficiently based on data in order to reduce the amount of downtime and in the event of any failure smart grid technology connected by 5g will be able to provide an instant diagnosis  right to the level of which pylon or transmitter is the cause of an outage  making it easier to remedy the situation and get the grid up and running again 5g could even help turn street lighting off at times when there are no pedestrians or vehicles in the area again reducing energy use carbon emissions and costs accenture estimate that in the us alone this technology has the potential to save as much as 1 billion every year more data more power although 5g devices themselves may demand less power than the telecoms technology it they will eventually replace that doesnt tell the whole story more connected devices with more data flowing between them relies on more data centres this has led some data centres to sign power purchase agreements to both reduce the cost of their insatiable desire for electricity and also ensure its provenance data centre as well as data centres the more numerous base stations needed for 5g will consume a lot of power one global mobile network provider says just to operate its existing base stations leads to a 650m electricity bill annually accounting for 65 of its overall power consumption base station tower contrary to the findings of the accenture report a recent estimate has put the power requirement of an individual 5g base station at three times that of a 4g keeping in mind that three of these are needed for every existing base station the analysis by zhengmao li of china mobile suggests a ninefold increase in electricity consumption just for that key part of a 5g network with the great britain power system decarbonising at a rapid pace the additional power required to electrify the economy with new technologies shouldnt have a negative environmental impact  at least when it comes to energy generation however as we use evermore powerful and numerous devices we need to ensure our power system has the flexibility to deliver electricity whatever the weather conditions this means a smarter grid with more backup power in the form of spinning turbines and storage tags decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs  energy storage  technology how clean is my electric car iain staffell imperial college london 29 august 2019 opinion electric vehicles are fast becoming mainstream there are now well over 200000 on britains roads and this number is growing by 30 per year 1 in 40 cars sold in britain is now electric around one third of which are pure battery models and two thirds are plugin hybrid 1 this radical shift is just beginning though britains electric vehicle fleet is expected to expand tenfold over the next five to ten years in more optimistic scenarios half of all vehicles on the road could be electric just fifteen years from now 2 while many see evs as the cleanest way to drive they are still the subject of much speculation recent criticisms range from a uk government report saying they wont end air pollution 3 to a string of studies often debunked claiming they emit more co 2 than diesel equivalents 4 the arguments are simple how can it be cleaner to swap a petrol car for electric if it is recharged using electricity from dirty coal or gas secondly how can electric vehicles repay the energy needed for mining lithium and to assemble the huge batteries that power them we review academic studies of battery manufacture and use data from electric insights to answer these questions on average britains evs emit just one quarter the co 2 of conventional petrol and diesel vehicles if the carbon emitted in making their battery is included this rises to only half the co 2 of a conventional vehicle electric vehicles bought today could be emitting just a tenth that of a petrol car in five years time as the electricity system is widely expected to continue moving towards lowcarbon sources manufacturing each kwh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol 5 electric vehicles typically have a battery capacity ranging from 30 kwh for small city hatchbacks up to 100 kwh for topend models  manufacturing the latter emits as much carbon as three roundtheworld flights more co 2 is emitted in building the battery for premium ev model than from the recharging it over a 15year lifetime 6 however the most efficient ev models could need just two to three years of driving to save the amount of carbon emitted in producing their batteries smaller evs with modest battery sizes are better for the environment whereas the largest luxury ev models could need three times longer to pay back their carbon cost hatchbacks small hatchbacks are the bestselling type of electric vehicles led by the nissan leaf they are also the cleanest to drive as they are small and light electric models currently emit around 33 grams of co 2 per km driven which is one quarter that of the most popular conventional vehicle a 2019 ford fiesta volkwagen eup electric car showcased at the frankfurt iaa motor show 2017 these electric models typically come with a 3045 kwh battery which pushes their lifetime emissions up around 60 gkm this is still less than half the emissions of a petrol or diesel car with the projected changes to the grid mix this will fall to less than one third of a standard car in just five years time ev models nissan

models include the iconic tesla models s and x and the new jaguar ipace these are much larger and need more energy to move meaning they have higher emissions than hatchbacks at 4454 gkm this is still just a quarter of the emissions from a comparable conventional car a top of the range mercedes sclass jaguar i pace ev the lifetime emissions of these luxury evs are notably higher though pushed up by the enormous 90100 kwh batteries they use to provide a driving range of over 250 miles these batteries are responsible for more co 2 emissions than driving the car over its entire lifetime models

taking off with over 8000 sold in britain to date their performance is comparable to small hatchbacks and they also currently emit around a quarter of the co2 of the most popular conventional van with around 40 gkm a white nissan env200 electric van makes deliveries in london with their 3040 kwh battery pack included this rises to just below half the co 2 of a small ford transit models considered

month and driving around 7500 miles per year will produce one and a half tonnes of co 2 per year in a modern petrol or diesel hatchback an electric vehicle doing the same mileage would take 4 years to produce this amount with a conventional vehicle there is no scope for reducing emissions over its lifetime as petrol and diesel fuels cannot become carbonfree on the contrary national grid expect the carbon content of britains electricity to continue falling so that an electric vehicle bought now will be emitting half as much co 2 in 2025 as it does today it is inconceivable that an electric vehicle in the uk could be more polluting than its conventional equivalent this would require electricity to have a carbon intensity of around 850950 gkwh values not seen since the 1960s 7 electric vehicles can be thought of as having an upfront carbon cost for manufacturing the battery which can then be repaid through lower emissions as they are driven with britains current grid electricity producing 205 gkwh smaller electric cars and vans will take between 2 and 4 years to have saved the amount of co 2 than was emitted in making their batteries for the larger luxury models it will take more like 56 years of driving to pay back that carbon with each passing year as the electricity mix gets cleaner this payback time will continue to fall and the environmental credentials of electric vehicles will keep growing stronger about this study the fuel economy and climate impact of vehicles are measured by the government through the amount of co 2 they release for every kilometre driven the uks most popular car the ford fiesta emits around 120 gkm in its cleanest models and 160 gkm in the sportier versions 9 electric vehicles dont emit any co 2 while driving but the power system does when producing the electricity needed to recharge them britains power system has changed dramatically over the last five years with carbon emissions halving and the share of coal generation falling from 36 to just 3 one kwh of electricity in britain is now contains 204 grams10 of co 2  less than the carbon released from burning one kwh of petrol an electric vehicle can drive up to four times further on 1 kwh than a petrol or diesel car could because electric motors are so much more efficient the charts above look at three categories of vehicle  small hatchbacks luxury saloons and suvs and small commercial vans each chart shows how the carbon emissions from an electric vehicle have fallen over the past decade and how they are expected to continue falling in the years to come the charts consider changes to the electricity generation mix used for recharging 11 and a gradual reduction in emissions from battery manufacture as the electricity mix changes in other countries 12 the range in direct emissions from recharging the dark blue bands covers the main ev models currently on sale in each segment and variants on each model available the top of each band highest emissions shows the least efficient ev model the bottom of each band lowest emissions shows the most efficient in the forecast these bands also include the range of emissions factors for electricity production coming from national grids scenarios there is a larger range in the estimated wholelifecycle emissions the lighter blue bands due to the additional uncertainty in the emissions caused by manufacturing 1 kwh of battery capacity and the range of battery sizes seen across ev models studies have estimated a wide range of emissions depending on the type of battery type its design where it is manufactured and how old the study is current estimates range from 40 up to 200 kg of co 2 emitted per kwh of battery capacity 13 we take the average across eight studies and assume 75125 kgco 2 per kwh the true value may be less than this as endoflife batteries could be recycled 14 or could be repurposed as a secondlife home or grid storage batteries it will also reduce in future as the electricity used to make

insights  electric vehicles evs how electric planes could help clean up the skies 7 august 2019 electrification you probably havent heard the phrase flygskam before but you might have felt it the recently coined swedish term refers to the a shame or embarrassment caused by flying and its effect of the environment its not an uncommon feeling either with 23 of people in the country now claiming to have abstained from air travel in the past year to lessen their climate impact from electric cars to cleaner shipping  transport is undergoing dramatic change however aviation is proving more difficult to decarbonise than most forms of transportation as airports cargo and the number of passengers flying every day continues to expand the need to decarbonise air travel is more pressing than ever if aviation is to avoid becoming a barrier to climate action for other transport sectors facing a similar dilemma electrification has proved a key route forward could the electrification of aeroplanes be next the problem with planes aeroplanes still rely on fossil fuels to provide the huge amount of power needed for takeoff globally flights produced 859 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  in 2017  the aviation industry as a whole accounts for 2 of all emissions derived from human activity and 12 of all transport emissions despite growing awareness of the contribution co 2 emissions make to causing the climate change emergency estimates show global air traffic could quadruple by 2050  electrification of air travel presents the potential to drastically cut plane emissions while also offering other benefits electric planes could be 50 quieter with reduced aircraft noise pollution potentially enabling airports to operate around the clock and closer to cities electric planes could also be as much as 10 cheaper for airlines to operate by eliminating the massive expense of jet fuel and fewer moving parts making electric motors easier to maintain compared to traditional jets these cost savings for airlines could be passed on to passengers and businesses needing to move goods in the form of cheaper flights but while the benefits are obvious the pressing question is how feasible is it the race to electric planes start ups are now racing to develop electric planes that will reduce emissions  such ampaire and wright electric the latter has even partnered with easyjet to develop electric planes for shorthaul routes of around 335mile distances which make up a fifth of the budget carriers routes easyjet going electric source easyjetcom  easyjet has highlighted london to amsterdam as a key route they hope wright electrics planes will operate with potential for other zeroemission flights between london and belfast dublin paris and brussels the partners aim to have an electric passenger jets on the tarmac by 2027  ahead on the runway however is israeli firm eviation which recently debuted a prototype for the worlds first commercial allelectric passenger aircraft  named alice the craft is expected to carry nine passengers for 650 miles and could be up and running as early as 2022 the challenge these companies face however is developing the batteries needed to power electric motors capable of delivering the propulsion needed for a plane full of passengers and luggage to take off currently batteries dont have anywhere near the energy density of traditional kerosene jet fuel  60 less  alices battery is colossal weighing 38 metric tons and accounting for 60 of the planes overall weight by contrast traditional planes allocate around 30 of total weight to fuel as conventional jets burn fuel they get lighter whereas electric planes would have to carry the same battery weight for the full duration of a flight closer to home on scotlands orkney islands electric planes could be perfectly suited to replace expensive jet fuel on the regions supershort island hopping service  theres little need for rangeanxiety with the longest flight from kirkwall to north ronaldsay lasting just 20 minutes and the shortest taking less than two minutes between the tiny islands of papa westray and neighbouring westray orkney is already known for its renewable credentials exporting more windgenerated power to the grid than it is able to consume the local council plans to investigate retrofitting its eightseater aircraft which carried more than 21000 passengers last year with electric motors as early as 2022 taking electric long haul the planes currently under development by ampaire wright electric and eviation are small aircraft only capable of short distance flights this is a long way behind the lengths capable of traditional fossil fuelpowered jets built by airline industry stalwarts airbus and boeing which are making their own move into electrification ampaire electric but only for short distances source ampairecom  even with drastic developments in battery technology however airbus estimates its longhaul a320 airliner which seats between 100 and 240 passengers would only be able to fly for a fifth of its range as an electric plane and only manage to carry half its regular cargo load elsewhere french jet enginemaker safran predicts that fullsize batterypowered commercial aircraft wont become a reality until 2050 at the earliest however if going fully electric may not yet be possible for large longhaul planes hybrid aircraft which use both conventional and electric power offer a potential middle ground a team comprising rollsroyce airbus and siemens are working on a project set to launch in 2021 called efan x which would combine an electric motor with a bae 146 aircrafts jet engine airbus say they may have to reduce their cargo to go electric source wwwairbuscom  hybrid models aim to use electric engines as the power source for the energyintensive takeoff and landing processes saving jet fuel and reducing noise around airports then while the plane is in the air it would switch to conventional kerosene engines which are most efficient when the plane reaches cruising altitude airbus aims to introduce a hybrid version of their bestselling singleaisle a320 passenger jet by 2035 while start ups and established jet makers jostle to get electric and hybrid planes off the ground there are other ideas around reducing aviation emissions technology of the future for decarbonising planes the university of illinois is working with nasa to develop hydrogen fuel cells capable of powering allelectric air travel hydrogen fuel cells work by combining hydrogen and oxygen to cause a chemical reaction that generates an electric current while the ingredients are very light the problem is they are bulky to store and on planes making effective use of space is key researchers are combatting this by experimenting with cryogenically freezing the gases into liquids which makes them more spaceefficient to store but makes refuelling trickier as airports would need the infrastructure to work with the freezing liquids there have also been experiments into solarpowered planes in 2016 a team of swiss adventurers succeeded in flying around the world in an aircraft that uses solar panels on its wings to power its propellers with a wingspan wider than a boeing 747 but weighing just a fraction of a traditional jet the solar impulse 2 is capable of staying airborne for as long as six days though only able to carry a lone pilot solar impulse 2 has great staying power while the feat is impressive the solar impulse team says the aim was to showcase the advancement of solar technology rather than develop solar planes for mainstream usage elsewhere mit engineers have been working on the first ever plane with no moving parts in its propulsion system instead the model uses ionic wind  a silent but hugely powerful flow of ions produced aboard the plane ionic wind is created when a current is passed between a thick and thin electrode with enough voltage applied the air between the electrodes produces thrust capable of propelling a small aircraft steadily during flight mit hope that ionic wind systems could be paired with conventional jets to make hybrid planes for a range of uses a general blueprint for an mit plane propelled by ionic wind source mit electric aircraft initiative newsmitedu  like any emerging technology it will take time to develop these alternative power sources to reach the point where they can safely and securely serve the global aviation industry however its clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is underway flying as we

july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue

 financial reports  investors  sustainability britains power system has never been closer to being fossilfree iain staffell imperial college london 23 july 2019 opinion electricity generation is decarbonising faster in britain than anywhere else in the world 1 changes to the way we produce power over the last six years have reduced carbon emissions by 100 million tonnes per year 2 the carbon savings made in britains power sector are equivalent to having taken every single car and van off our roads 3 this puts britain at the forefront of the wider trend towards clean electricity coal generation is collapsing in germany  having fallen 20 in the last year due to rising carbon prices renewables have beaten fossil fuels as the largest source of generation in europe  a third of americas coal power stations have retired over the last decade as they switch to cleaner natural gas britains coal power stations made international headlines in may for sitting completely idle for two full weeks but coal is only part of the story the second quarter of 2019 saw three major milestones that signal britains progress towards a clean power system the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh across a whole day for the first time renewables hit an alltime high supplying more than half of britains electricity over a full day and for the first time ever less than a tenth of electricity was produced from fossil fuels going below 100 grams 100 grams of co 2 per kwh is an important number two years ago the committee on climate change recommended it as the target for 2030 that would mean our electricity system is in line with the national commitment to decarbonise britains electricity has dipped below 100 grams for single hours at a time but until now it had never done so for a full day june 30 th was a sunny sunday with a good breeze that brought a 33c heatwave to an end electricity demand was among the lowest seen all year while wind output was at a threemonth high the carbon intensity of electricity sat below 100 gkwh for half of the day falling to a minimum of just 73 gkwh in the midafternoon carbon emissions averaged over the day were 97 gkwh beating the previous record of 104 gkwh set a year ago fig 1  britains generation mix during june 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kwh click to viewdownload going above 50 renewables june 30 th was a recordbreaker in a second way wind solar biomass and hydro supplied 55 of electricity demand over the day  smashing the previous daily record of 49 set last summer for the first day in the national grids history more electricity came from renewables than any other source that day britains wind farms produced twice as much electricity as all fossil fuels combined a quarter of the countrys electricity demand was met by onshore wind farms and 15 from offshore 4 despite several reactors being offline for maintenance nuclear power provided nearly a fifth of electricity again more than was supplied by all fossil fuels heading towards fossilfree electricity the rise of renewable energy has been a major factor in decarbonising britains electricity complemented by the incredible fall in coal generation every single coal plant in britain has sat idle for at least two days a week since the start of spring it has been three years since britains first zerocoal hour a year later came the first full day and earlier this year we saw the longest coalfree run in history  lasting 18 days this summer could see the first full month of no coal output if this trend continues fig 2  number of hours per week with zero generation from britains coal power stations click to viewdownload attention must now shift from zero coal to fossil free unabated natural gas without carbon capture and storage needs to be removed from the grid mix by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis and ensure the uk hits netzero emissions across the whole economy at the start of this decade britains power system had never operated with less than half of electricity coming from fossil fuels as renewables were rolled out across the country the share of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically by 2014 the grid was able to operate with less than onethird from fossil fuels and by 2016 it had gone below onefifth on may 26 th  the share of fossil fuels in britains electricity fell below 10 for the first time ever fig 3  the record minimum share of fossil fuels in britains electricity mix over the last decade with projections of the current trend to 2025 click to viewdownload this record could have gone further though during the afternoon 600 mw of wind power was shed  enough to power half a million homes national grid had to turn off a tenth of scotlands wind farms to keep the system stable and secure this wind power had to be replaced by gas biomass and hydro plants elsewhere in the country as these were located closer to demand centres and could be fully controlled at short notice this turndown coincides with ten straight hours where power prices were zero or negative going down to a minimum of 71mwh in the afternoon national grids bill for balancing the system that day alone came to 66m if the power system could have coped with all the renewable energy being generated fossil fuels would have been pushed down to just 8 of the generation mix this highlights the challenges that national grid face in their ambition to run a zero carbon power system by 2025  and the tangible benefits that could already be realised today if the trend of the last decade continues britain could be on course for its first fossilfree hour as early as 2023 this will only be possible if the technical issues around voltage and inertia at times of high wind output can be tackled with new lowcarbon technologies other countries are grappling with questions about whether renewables can be relied on to replace coal and gas britain is proof that renewables can achieve things that werent imaginable just a decade ago zero carbon electricity is  the job that cant wait  britain only has a few more years to wait before the first fossilfree hours become a reality 1 over the last decade the carbon intensity of electricity generation in britain has fallen faster than in any other major economy source energy revolution global outlook  2 in the 12 months to july 2019 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation totalled 605 million tonnes in the 12 months to july 2013 these emissions were 1602 million tonnes both figures include emissions from imported electricity and from producing and transporting biomass see electric insights and our peerreviewed methodology paper for details of the calculation 3 in 2017 the uks cars emitted 70 million

uk will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 july 2019 opinion the starting gun has fired and the challenge is underway the government has officially set 2050 as the target year in which the uk will achieve carbon neutrality  theres no denying this economywide transformation will need a great deal of investment reaching net zero carbon emissions will require an evolutionary overhaul of not just great britains electricity system but the uk economy as a whole and indeed the way we live our lives and go about our business but that doesnt mean its out of reach instead it will fall to technologies such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to make it economical and possible the secret to making decarbonisation affordable the uks committee on climate change ccc estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1 of forecast gdp per annum in 2050 however the business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee inquiry found that failure to deploy ccus and beccs technology could double the cost to 2 there are a number of reasons for this such as the cost to jobs productivity and living standards of shutting down industrial emitters ccuss ability to contribute to a hydrogen economy can help avoid this moreover the ccc claims even with industries striving to decarbonise rapidly as much as 100 megatonnes of hardtoabate carbon dioxide co 2  is expected to remain in the uk economy by 2050 this makes carbon negative techniques and technologies  such as beccs  which uses woody biomass that has absorbed carbon in its lifetime as forests  alongside direct air capture dac the boosting of ocean plant productivity much greater tree planting and better sequestration of carbon in soil essential if the uk is to attain true carbon neutrality the importance of beccs and ccus in the zero carbon future is clear now is the time for rapid development not in 2030 not in 2040 but today in 2019 and into the 2020s but doing this requires the government to move beyond its historic policies that have failed to support the technology in the past progress needs longterm frameworks that provide private sector investors with the certainty they need to kickstart the commercialscale deployment of ccus technologies laying down the tracks to negative emissions for carbon capture to become an integrated part of the energy system it must deliver value well beyond the energy sector establishing markets for products developed from captured carbon will play a role here but to set the wheels in motion financial frameworks are needed that can allow beccs and ccus to thrive one device that can allow the market to develop ccus is the creation of contracts for difference cfds for carbon capture these currently exist in the lowcarbon generation space between generators and the governmentowned low carbon contracts company  lccc  through these contracts power generators are paid the difference between their cost of generating low carbon electricity known as a strike price and the price of electricity in great britains wholesale power market if the power price in the market is higher than the strike price generators pay the difference back to the lccc meaning consumers are protected from price spikes too it means that the generator is protected from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power offering the security to invest in new technology more than this cfds last many years meaning they transcend political cycles and the cost per megawatt can be reduced with a longer contract creating a market for carbon capture or negative emissions generation could offer the same security to generators to invest in the technology a cfd for beccs should not only incentivise the building of infrastructure to capture carbon but we must also recognise the valuable role that negative emissions can play by compensating beccs producers for their negative emissions it should provide a lower cost alternative to reducing all other co2 emissions to zero while still ensuring that the uk can get to net zero beyond installing carbon capture at existing generation sites one of the major financial barriers to the wider deployment of ccus and beccs is the cost and liability associated with transporting and storing captured carbon a regulated asset base rab funding model would encourage investment by gradually recovering the costs of transport and storage via a regulated return this approach is currently under consideration as a means of financing other major infrastructure projects  a rab allows businesses including investment and pension funds to invest in projects under the oversight of a government regulator in exchange for their commitment investors can collect a fee through regular consumer and nondomestic bills led by industry guided by government ultimately the current carbon trading system is based around charging polluters but as we approach a postcoal uk and in order to achieve net zero its necessary for this to evolve  from economically disincentivising emissions to incentivising carbonnegative power generation however with the cost of carbon capture and negative emissions differing between types of industries and technologies theres a requirement to consider differentiated carbon prices to guide industry through longterm strategy but the need for carbon capture development is too pressing for us as an industry to wait at drax power station our beccs pilot is just the beginning of our wider ambitions to become the first negative emissions power station our use of biomass already makes drax power station the largest generator of renewable electricity in great britain the responsiblymanaged working forests our suppliers source from absorbed carbon from the atmosphere as they grew so adding carbon capture at scale to this supply chain can turn our operation from low carbon to carbonneutral and eventually carbon negative and we have bigger plans still to create a net zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region  in partnership with equinor and national grid the cluster would deliver carbon capture at the scale needed to not just decarbonise the most carbonintensive industrial region in the uk but to put the country at the forefront of the decarbonisation of industry and manufacturing government action is needed to make ccus and beccs economically sustainable at scale as an integrated part of our energy system however the onus is on us the energy industry to lead development and act as trusted partners that can deliver the decarbonisation needed to reach net zero carbon by 2050 learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus why experts think bioenergy with

widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags
