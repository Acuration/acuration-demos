return so what is biomass and how does it work biomass in the form of compressed wood pellets is a lowcarbon replacement for coal that can be used at power stations to generate renewable energy such as electricity and heat drax works with landowners across alabama to implement bestinclass management practices enabling them to maximize the benefits that sustainable forest management can deliver take a closer look frequently asked questions how is biomass made how does biomass generate power what is sustainable biomass how is drax ensuring the health of alabama forests biomass pellets are made at a pelletisation plant here wood that is unsuitable for other industries like sawmill residues are brought together the wood is chipped screened for quality heated to reduce its moisture content and then converted into a fine powder this is then pressed through a grate at high pressure to form the solid short dense biomass pellet biomass can be produced from different sources including agricultural or forestry residues dedicated energy crops or waste products such as uneaten food drax power station uses compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in the us canada europe and brazil and are largely made up of lowgrade wood produced as a byproduct of the production and processing of higher value wood products like lumber and furniture biomass producers and users must meet a range of stringent measures for their biomass to be certified as sustainable and responsibly sourced areas drax sources its pellets from january 2021 to

similar way to coal allowing existing coal power stations to be transformed to use renewable bioenergy instead a conveyor system takes pellets from storage through to pulverising mills where they are crushed into a fine powder that is then blown into the power stations boiler here the biomass is combusted as fuel the heat from this combustion is used to make steam which powers the generators that produce electricity biomass pellets density and uniform shape also makes them easier to transport and store in large quantities sustainable biomass is made of the low grade and low quality byproducts from the forestry industry that dont negatively impact the growth of the forest the amount of carbon being stored biodiversity and the socioeconomic wellbeing of the communities that surround them when used for heat and power sustainable biomass releases significantly less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels using forestry residues from harvesting also helps reduce the risk of forest fires pests and disease outbreaks this ensures that forests will not be negatively affected by the cultivation of biomass instead the removal of waste and lowgrade wood promotes healthy biodiversity and growth
