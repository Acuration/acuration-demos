The world needs electricity. But how many of us really know how it’s generated?
Come visit Drax Power Station
in Yorkshire or
Cruachan Power Station
in the Scottish Highlands and see with your own eyes!
Electricity is at the heart of everything we do. It powers our homes, our businesses, our schools and our hospitals. We use it every day, but how often do we stop and think how it’s produced? Believe us, it’s an amazing process.
It’s not just the power station that’s open to visitors. You’ll also be able to explore the
Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve
, to see local wildlife on a stunning reserve built and maintained by Drax.
Visits to our other businesses
across Drax Group, including our
hydropower stations
, are also available upon request.
