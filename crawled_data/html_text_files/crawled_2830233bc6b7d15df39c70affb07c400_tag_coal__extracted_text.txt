a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with national grid ofgem and the uk government the board of drax has determined to end commercial coal generation at drax power station in 2021  ahead of the uks 2025 deadline commercial coal generation is expected to end in march 2021 with formal closure of the coal units in september 2022 at the end of existing capacity market obligations will gardiner drax group ceo said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a worldleading carbon negative company by 2030 draxs move away from coal began some years ago and im proud to say were going to finish the job well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future coal in front of biomass storage domes at drax power station 2016 drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations under these proposals commercial generation from coal will end in march 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet capacity market obligations until september 2022 the closure of the two coal units is expected to involve oneoff closure costs in the region of 2535 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at drax power station of 2535 million per year once complete drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from april 2021 the carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was 240 million in addition to 103 million of inventory at 31 december 2019 which drax intends to use in the period up to 31 march 2021 the group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the groups financial statements a further update on these items will be provided in the groups interim financial statements for the first half of 2020 as part of the proposed coal closure programme the group is implementing a broader review of operations at drax power station this review aims to

july 2019 opinion electricity generation is decarbonising faster in britain than anywhere else in the world 1 changes to the way we produce power over the last six years have reduced carbon emissions by 100 million tonnes per year 2 the carbon savings made in britains power sector are equivalent to having taken every single car and van off our roads 3 this puts britain at the forefront of the wider trend towards clean electricity coal generation is collapsing in germany  having fallen 20 in the last year due to rising carbon prices renewables have beaten fossil fuels as the largest source of generation in europe  a third of americas coal power stations have retired over the last decade as they switch to cleaner natural gas britains coal power stations made international headlines in may for sitting completely idle for two full weeks but coal is only part of the story the second quarter of 2019 saw three major milestones that signal britains progress towards a clean power system the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh across a whole day for the first time renewables hit an alltime high supplying more than half of britains electricity over a full day and for the first time ever less than a tenth of electricity was produced from fossil fuels going below 100 grams 100 grams of co 2 per kwh is an important number two years ago the committee on climate change recommended it as the target for 2030 that would mean our electricity system is in line with the national commitment to decarbonise britains electricity has dipped below 100 grams for single hours at a time but until now it had never done so for a full day june 30 th was a sunny sunday with a good breeze that brought a 33c heatwave to an end electricity demand was among the lowest seen all year while wind output was at a threemonth high the carbon intensity of electricity sat below 100 gkwh for half of the day falling to a minimum of just 73 gkwh in the midafternoon carbon emissions averaged over the day were 97 gkwh beating the previous record of 104 gkwh set a year ago fig 1  britains generation mix during june 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kwh click to viewdownload going above 50 renewables june 30 th was a recordbreaker in a second way wind solar biomass and hydro supplied 55 of electricity demand over the day  smashing the previous daily record of 49 set last summer for the first day in the national grids history more electricity came from renewables than any other source that day britains wind farms produced twice as much electricity as all fossil fuels combined a quarter of the countrys electricity demand was met by onshore wind farms and 15 from offshore 4 despite several reactors being offline for maintenance nuclear power provided nearly a fifth of electricity again more than was supplied by all fossil fuels heading towards fossilfree electricity the rise of renewable energy has been a major factor in decarbonising britains electricity complemented by the incredible fall in coal generation every single coal plant in britain has sat idle for at least two days a week since the start of spring it has been three years since britains first zerocoal hour a year later came the first full day and earlier this year we saw the longest coalfree run in history  lasting 18 days this summer could see the first full month of no coal output if this trend continues fig 2  number of hours per week with zero generation from britains coal power stations click to viewdownload attention must now shift from zero coal to fossil free unabated natural gas without carbon capture and storage needs to be removed from the grid mix by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis and ensure the uk hits netzero emissions across the whole economy at the start of this decade britains power system had never operated with less than half of electricity coming from fossil fuels as renewables were rolled out across the country the share of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically by 2014 the grid was able to operate with less than onethird from fossil fuels and by 2016 it had gone below onefifth on may 26 th  the share of fossil fuels in britains electricity fell below 10 for the first time ever fig 3  the record minimum share of fossil fuels in britains electricity mix over the last decade with projections of the current trend to 2025 click to viewdownload this record could have gone further though during the afternoon 600 mw of wind power was shed  enough to power half a million homes national grid had to turn off a tenth of scotlands wind farms to keep the system stable and secure this wind power had to be replaced by gas biomass and hydro plants elsewhere in the country as these were located closer to demand centres and could be fully controlled at short notice this turndown coincides with ten straight hours where power prices were zero or negative going down to a minimum of 71mwh in the afternoon national grids bill for balancing the system that day alone came to 66m if the power system could have coped with all the renewable energy being generated fossil fuels would have been pushed down to just 8 of the generation mix this highlights the challenges that national grid face in their ambition to run a zero carbon power system by 2025  and the tangible benefits that could already be realised today if the trend of the last decade continues britain could be on course for its first fossilfree hour as early as 2023 this will only be possible if the technical issues around voltage and inertia at times of high wind output can be tackled with new lowcarbon technologies other countries are grappling with questions about whether renewables can be relied on to replace coal and gas britain is proof that renewables can achieve things that werent imaginable just a decade ago zero carbon electricity is  the job that cant wait  britain only has a few more years to wait before the first fossilfree hours become a reality 1 over the last decade the carbon intensity of electricity generation in britain has fallen faster than in any other major economy source energy revolution global outlook  2 in the 12 months to july 2019 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation totalled 605 million tonnes in the 12 months to july 2013 these emissions were 1602 million tonnes

split between onshore and offshore wind farms typically around 23 of the countrys wind power comes from its onshore wind farms tags coal  decarbonisation  electric insights  gas can great britain keep breaking renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides

paying why the treasury should maintain a higher carbon price 25 october 2018 power generation last week it was green gb week  a nationwide campaign supported by the uk government showcasing the countrys green credentials and progress in transitioning towards a low carbon world it is therefore timely that ahead of the autumn budget the energy industry should be speaking about measures such as the carbon price support mechanism which are within the power of government to help keep great britain on track in meeting its decarbonisation goals aurora energy research a leading energy research and analytics firm has produced fresh analysis that suggests that maintaining a higher carbon price is key to phasing out coal power generation and decarbonising the uk electricity sector in a timely costeffective manner  is the carbon price at risk in april 2013 hm treasury introduced the carbon price support  a tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain in part this was a response to low costs in the european emissions trading system which requires generators to buy certificates against their emissions at the time the uk government felt that these certificates were too cheap and wanted to impose a higher carbon price to drive a more modern lowcarbon energy mix this carbon price support has had a huge impact particularly on coal prior to its introduction coal represented 50 of power generation but since it has fallen to record lows 2017 saw the first day without any coal on the power system since the industrial revolution records continue to be broken throughout 2018 with coal generation falling to 1 during summer months  however 2018 has also seen prices within the emissions trading system surge prices started this year at 8tonne and now seem to be steadying at roughly 20tonne this has created uncertainty over the future of the uk carbon price support scheme many in energy from power generators to environmental campaign groups are worried that the treasury might respond to rising european prices by slashing the carbon price support in this years autumn budget which could threaten to undo the success the uk has had in decarbonising its energy mix the carbon price is needed to keep coal at bay aurora has tested the impacts of different trajectories for the carbon price going forward to 2040 and the implications are significant particularly for coal auroras analysis shows that if government maintains the current carbon price support rate of 18tonne then at current eu ets futures levels coal should come off the gb power system in 202122 by contrast the same analysis suggests that if chancellor philip hammond were to reduce the carbon price support to 7tonne then coal power stations would stay on the system until 2025 and increase generation during that time as illustrated below source aurora energy research this would make it difficult for the uk to meet its carbon targets  the uk government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with 5yearly carbon budgets cutting the carbon price support rate to 7tonne would result in 29 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide co 2  during the 4 th carbon budget period which runs from 202327 this is an increase of almost 20 on total power sector emissions  against a carbon budget that the uk is currently on track to miss  the cost of the carbon price a higher carbon price raises electricity prices slightly but the mechanics of this are complex and the rising price of electricity is somewhat offset by lower subsidy payments to low carbon generators comparing a status quo scenario to one where the carbon price support falls to 7tonne raises annual power system costs by 700 million average over 202140 which translates to roughly 9 a year on the average households electricity bill source aurora energy research decarbonisation affects not just the future of gbs power system but also its international reputation and progress in meeting climate change targets  the carbon price support has helped to make gbs power system a success story in reducing carbon emissions while keeping costs reasonable there are always tradeoffs to be made in policy

carbon pricing  coal  decarbonisation  energy policy coal comeback pushes up uks carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 17 september 2018 opinion 10year high gas prices 1 have prompted a resurgence in coalfired power across britain  and with it a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation if coalfired electricity remains cheaper than gasfired  as analysts predict  we could see the first yearonyear rise in carbon emissions from britains power sector in six years this highlights the importance of retaining a strong carbon price if we are to ensure the successful decarbonisation of the power system is not reversed after dropping to a historic low of just 02 gw during june and july britains coal power generation doubled in august and has shot up to 2 gw during the first week of september the last time coal output was this high was during the beast from the east  when temperatures plummeted in march with these coal power stations running instead of more efficient gas plants britain is producing an extra 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  every hour 2 carbon emissions from electricity generation are up 15 as a result these coal plants are not running solely because they are needed to meet peak demand but because gas prices have risen sharply and carbon prices have not kept up making coal power stations more economic to run than gasfired ones it became cheaper to generate power from coal than from gas see thick lines chart below in late august even though carbon prices now double the cost of generating electricity from coal 3 coal plants are consistently in the money at the moment meaning they can generate power profitably all day and night estimated cost of generating electricity from coal and gas in quarter 3 thick lines and the output from coal power stations in britain thin line the cost of emitting co 2 has increased sharply up 45 so far this year due to the ongoing rally in european emissions trading scheme eu ets prices rising carbon prices should make gas more economical to burn as it emits less than half the co 2 of coal however wholesale gas prices have also risen 40 since the start of the year as supplies and storage are squeezed in the run up to winter  gas prices are at a tenyear high currently 14 above their previous quarterlyaverage peak back in 2013 see chart below  these rising costs are feeding through into wholesale power prices which have risen by a third over the past year to hit 60mwh the estimated cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels over the last 20 years along with the cost of emitting co 2  britains carbon price strengthened dramatically through 201415 due to the government implementing a carbon price support scheme this caused gas to become competitive against coal for power generation leading to carbon emissions from the power sector halving  unless britains carbon price can once again make up the gap between coal and gas prices we risk rolling back some of the worldleading gains made on cleaning up our electricity system  the committee on climate change has made it clear that power is the only sector that is pulling its weight when it comes to decarbonising the uk clean electricity could power lowcarbon vehicles and heating but this opportunity will be wasted if the electricity comes from highcarbon coal so what can be done the sharp rise in gas prices hints at a lack of flexibility in the energy system britain came uncomfortably close to gas shortages in march in part due to the closure of the countrys largest gas storage site with nearly half of the electricity generated in britain coming from gas plus fivesixths of household heat diversifying into other  cleaner  energy sources would help insulate consumers and businesses from price spikes no one country has the power to determine international fuel prices several factors have come together to push up gas prices  including a lack of transmission capacity depleted stores of gas after the long hot summer and a lack of wind power increased output from gasfired stations suppliers which dont wish to be caught short after the beast from the east are also stocking up on gas any kneejerk reaction to try and lower the cost of electricity for example slashing the cost of carbon emissions may only have a shortterm impact and could easily lead to longerterm damage such as the resurgence of coal which would require further interventions in the future britain does have control over its carbon price its power stations and industry currently pay the emissions trading system price determined on the europewide market which has fluctuated wildly over the past week between 25 22 and 19 17 per tonne plus 18 per tonne in carbon price support which goes to the treasury this needs to

electricity generation for more than a century it was in that year that drax power station began cofiring biomass as a renewable alternative to coal it symbolised the beginnings of the power stations ambitious transformation from fossilfuel stalwart to the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator this plan presented a massive engineering challenge for drax with significant amounts of new knowledge quickly needed fifteen years later three of its generating units now run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of biomass while coal has been relegated to stepping in only to cover spikes in demand and improve system stability  now drax has converted a fourth unit from coal to biomass this development represents the passing of a two thirds marker for the power stations coalfree ambitions and adds 600plus megawatts mw of renewable electricity to great britains national transmission system  building on the past drax first converted a coal unit to biomass in 2013 with two more following in 2014 and 2016 this put drax in an interesting position going into a new conversion on one hand it is one of the most experienced generators in the world when it comes to dealing with and upgrading to biomass on the other its still relatively new to the low carbon fuel compared with its dealings with coal adam nicholson weve decades of understanding of how to use coal but weve only been operating with biomass since we started the full conversion trials in 2011 says adam nicholson section head for process performance at drax power weve got few running hours under our belts with the new fuel versus the hundreds of man years of coal knowledge and operation all around the country when converting a generating unit the steam turbine and generator itself remain the same the difference is all in the material being delivered stored crushed and blown into the boiler and burned to heat up water and create steam and because biomass can be a volatile substance  much more so than coal  this process must be a careful one drax could build on the learnings and equipment it had already developed for biomass such as specially built trains and pulverising mills  but storage proved a bigger issue the giant biomass domes at drax that make up the ecostore are advanced technological structures carefully attuned to storing biomass but for unit 4 they were off limits instead drax engineers had to come up with another solution the journey of a pellet through the power station normally wood pellets are brought into drax by train unloaded and stored in the biomass domes before travelling through the power station to the mills and then boilers  unit 4 however sits in the second half of the station  built 12 years after the first this slight change in location presented a problem theres no link from the eco store to unit 4 at all explains nicholson you cant use the storage domes and that whole infrastructure to get anything to unit 4 drax engineers set about designing a new conveyor system that could connect the domes to the mills and boiler that powers unit 4 after weeks of design the team had a theoretical plan to connect the two locations with one problem it was entirely uneconomical rail unloading building 1 and storage silos if we were building a new plant it would be relatively easy because you could plan properly and wouldnt have existing equipment in the way says nicholson we had to plan around it and make use of the preexisting plant within that preexisting plant though were vital pieces of equipment some of which had laid dormant since drax stopped fuelling its boilers with a mixture of coal and biomass and opted instead for full unit conversions drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003 using two different materials  a mix of around 5 biomass and 95 coal a direct injection facility was added in 2005 it involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power stations 60 mills  then the amount of renewable power drax was able to generate roughly doubled in the summer of 2010 when a 400 mw cofiring facility became operational back to the present day its fortunate for the unit 4 conversion that the cofiring facility includes its own rail unloading building rub 1 and storage silos they are located much closer to the unit than the bigger rub 2 and the massive biomass domes this solved the problem of storage but moving the required volumes of biomass through the plant without significant transport construction still posed a challenge rail unloading building 1 and storage silos for unit 4 left ecostore biomass domes for units 13 right to tackle this the team modified a pneumatic transport system previously tested during cofiring to have the capability to blow entire pellets from the storage facilities around the power station at speeds of more than 20 metres per second the success of this system proved key  it was the final piece necessary to make the conversion of unit 4 economical  the postcoal future andy koss for now draxs fifth and sixth generating unit remain coalpowered but are called upon less frequently with great britain set to go completely coalfree by 2025 there are plans to convert these too but as part of a system of combined cycle gas turbines and giant batteries rather than biomass powered units its an opportunity for drax to again leverage its preexisting plant and provide the grid with a fast actingsource of lowercarbon electricity as with converting to biomass it will pose a complex new engineering challenge  one that will prepare drax to meet the future needs of grid as it continues to change and demand greater flexibility from generators the speed at which the unit 4 project has been delivered is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we continue to see at drax were nimble and innovative enough to meet future challenges says andy koss chief executive drax power we may look very different in 10 or 20 years time but the ethos of that innovation and agility is something that will persist repowering the remaining coal plant with gas and up to 200 mw of batteries will sit alongside research into areas such as carbon capture use and storage ccus that is all geared towards expanding drax power beyond a single site generator into a portfolio of flexible power production facilities unit 4s conversion is more than just a step beyond halfway for the power stations decarbonisation but a significant step towards becoming entirely coalfree  find out more about unit 4  tags biomass energy  coal  drax power station  investors  technology great britain is almost ready for coalfree summers 14 august 2018 power generation every summer great britain uses less and less coal this june the fossil fuels share of the electricity mix dipped below 1 for the first time ever  for 12 days it dropped all the way to zero spurred on by the beginnings of an uncharacteristically dry hot summer and a jump in solar generation the possibility of the country going entirely coalfree for a full summer now looks more achievable than ever in modern times this is one of the key findings from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london it found that across q2 2018 there were as many coalfree hours as in the whole of 2016 and 2017 combined and while the reports findings are hugely positive they also hint at where development is still needed what else does the performance of this quarter tell us about what we can expect in the power sector  in great britain and around the world great britain is slashing coal generation the rest of the world needs to catch up great britain has reduced its coalfired power generation by fourfifths over the last five years last quarter the countrys coal fleet ran at just 3 of its 129 gigawatt gw capacity coal capacity is now lower than the capacity of solar pv panels 131 gw installed nationwide with the most recent decline resulting from draxs conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass  when coal generation was running it primarily provided system balancing services overnight in may and june rather than baseload electricity however this positive trend is not seen around the world the share of coal in national power systems during 2017 globally coal still provides 38 of the worlds electricity  the same amount it did 30 years ago this comes despite efforts in europe and north america to move away from coal and growing investment into renewable generation and technologies overall europes coal generation dropped from 39 to 22 over the last 30 years  despite some countries  such as poland and serbia  still drawing significant generation from the fossil fuel the us has also reduced its coal generation from 57 to 31 over the past 30 years as natural gas proves more economical even in an era of procoal policies  coal train at rail station in india however in the middle east and africa which draw significant generation from their oil and gas reserves and south america where coal accounts for less than 3 of generation total coal generation is growing in fact globally only seven countries use less coal today than 30 years ago germany poland spain ukraine the us great britain and canada electric insights attributes part of this global growth to the continued increase in demand for electricity particularly in asia china south korea and indonesia collectively burn 10 times more coal than they did 30 years ago indias coal habit has also increased over the past decade to account for 76 of its electricity generation while japans usage has grown from 15 to 34 in the same period as well as the stresses created by growing demand this highlights a global disparity in the approach to decarbonising electricity systems and a need for longerterm environmentally and sociallyconscious marketbased initiatives that encourage

edges closer to zero coal solar farm in south wales decarbonisation is growing but its going to get harder great britains decline in coal use has rapidly accelerated its decarbonisation efforts annual coal power station emissions have shrunk over the past five years from 129 to 19 million tonnes of co 2 and helped reduce the average carbon intensity of electricity generation to a record low of 195 gkwh last quarter however this rapid pace of decarbonisation is unlikely to be sustained as growth in renewables faces a plateau the countrys current nuclear capacity reaches retirement and the target of moving beyond coal by 2025 is completed renewable sources now account for a steady 25 of annual electricity generation these sources largely came onto the system through policies such as the governments renewables obligation which is now closed to entrants contracts for differences the future of which is uncertain for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and feedin tariffs for rooftop solar installations which will close in april 2019 the end of these initiative paints a hazy picture of how future renewable capacity will be brought into the system nuclear capacity also

play a major part in renewable generation if the first quarter of 2018 was defined by low temperatures and heavy snowfall  the second quarter saw the impact of the opposite in weather conditions from 23 june a heatwave set in around the country that saw temperatures increase by 33 o c in a week driving demand to jump 860 mw  the equivalent of an extra 25 million households or an area the size of scotland  the increase in demand isnt as drastic as when cold fronts hit but if summers continue to get hotter this could change today wintertime demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it drops below 14 o c as electric heaters are plugged in to aid largely gasbased centralheating systems when the mercury rises however demand increases by 350 mw for every degree rise over 20 o c as businesses turn on air conditioning and the countrys refrigerators work harder these heatwave spikes are at the moment more easily dealt with than winter storms while the beast from the east saw demand reaching a peak of 533 gw junes topped out at 325 gw the clear skies and long days of june also meant solar pv generation soared making up for the wind drought caused by the highpressure weather wind output floated between 03 gw and 43 gw in june far below its quarter peak to 13 gw however solar made up for this by peaking past 8 gw for 13 days in june and setting a new record of 939 gw at lunchtime on

well over a century  but times have changed a growing understanding of fossil fuels contribution to pollution and global climate change means more energy companies around the world now realise their longterm success depends on moving away from coal as a result between 2015 and last year construction of new coalpowered plants dropped by 73 the powering past coal alliance is an initiative helping facilitate this move it brings together those working moving completely away from coal and is comprised of a number of governments businesses and energy companies  including drax  however it isnt the only initiative of its type  nor is drax the only electricity generator fast moving away from coal here we look at some of the other companies giving coal the cold shoulder avedøre is a high efficiency multifuel combined heat and power plant in denmark operated by ørsted source ørsted ørsted denmarks partly stateowned global energy firm once called dong an acronym for danish oil and natural gas is one of the largest of the alliances members leading the charge away from coal the company is at the forefront of the energy sectors transformation towards renewables it is the global leader in offshore wind having installed more than one quarter of the worlds total offshore wind capacity more recently the company changed its name to ørsted after the danish scientist who first discovered that electric currents create magnetic fields the name change reflects the companys move away from fossil fuels including coal  the company has slashed its coal usage from 62 million tonnes in 2006 to 11 million last year and aims to reach zero by 2023 as well as cutting its co 2 emissions by 96 this is thanks largely to the massive growth in ørsteds offshore wind farm business as well as the conversion of six of ørsteds danish coalfired power stations to biomass the company aims to have enough wind capacity by 2020 to supply 16 million people in europe denver colorado  xcel energys
