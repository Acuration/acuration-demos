transport contact us tag decarbonisation what is lng and how is it cutting global shipping emissions 5 july 2019 sustainable business shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags decarbonisation  engineering  supply chain  sustainability  technology  transport what is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future 27 june 2019 carbon capture nasa museum houston texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional opportunity for the uks biggest renewable

customers  decarbonisation  investors  sustainability drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a

investors  supply chain  sustainability  united states  wood pellets the wooden buildings of the future 22 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy when we think of modern cities and the buildings within them we often think of the materials theyre constructed from  we think of the concrete jungle since the 19 th century steel glass and concrete enabled the building of bigger and more elaborate buildings in rapidlygrowing cities and those materials quickly came to define the structures themselves but today that could be changing new technologies and building techniques mean wood a material humans have used in construction for millennia is making a comeback and reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings too return of the treehouse civilisation has been building structures from wood for longer than you may realise the 32metre tall pagoda of horyuji temple in japan was built using wood felled in 594 and still stands today the sakyumuni pagoda of fogong temple in china is nearly twice as tall with a height of 67 metres it was built in 1056 today wood is once again finding favour the 30metre tall wood innovation and design centre of the university of british columbia unbc in canada was completed in october 2014 and is among the first of this new generation of wooden buildings and theyre only getting bigger this year the completion of the 84metre 24storey hoho tower in vienna will make it the tallest wooden building in the world but this will be far surpassed if plans for the oakwood tower in london are approved designed by a private architecture firm and researchers from the university of cambridge the proposed building will be 300metres tall if construction goes ahead making it londons second tallest structure after the shard and it would be made of wood falling back in love with wood wood construction fell out of favour in the 19 th century when materials like steel and concrete became more readily available but new developments in timber manufacturing are changing this researchers in graz austria discovered that by gluing strips of wood with their grains at right angles to each other the relative weakness of each piece of wood is compensated the result is a wood product known as crosslaminated timber clt which is tougher than steel for its weight but is much lighter and can be machined into extremely precise shapes think of it as the plywood of the future allowing construction workers to build bigger quicker and lighter glued laminated timber commonly known as glulam is another technology technique enabling greater use of wood in more complex construction manufactured by bonding highstrength timbers with waterproof adhesives glulam can also be shaped into curves and arches  pushing woods usage beyond straight planks and beam these dense timbers dont ignite easily either they are designed to act more like logs than kindling and feature an outer layer that is purposefully designed to char when exposed to flame which in turn insulates the inner wood susceptibility to mould insect and water damage is indeed a concern of anyone building with wood but as the centuriesold pagodas in japan and china demonstrate care for wood properly and theres no real limit to how long you can make it last so wood is sturdy but so is steel  why change green giant construction with concrete and steel produces an enormous carbon footprint concrete production on its own accounts for 5 of all our carbon emissions but building with wood can change that unbcs innovation and design centre saved 400 tonnes of carbon by using wood instead of concrete and steel on top of that building with wood freezes the carbon captured by the trees as they grow when trees die naturally in the forest they decompose and release the carbon they have absorbed during growth back in the atmosphere but wood felled and used to construct a building has captured that carbon for as long as it stands in place a city of wooden buildings could be a considerable carbon sink this can have further ripple effects the more timber is required for construction the more it increases the market for wood and the responsiblymanaged forests that material comes from and the more forests that are planted and managed with proper governance the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere  according to research from yale university a worldwide switch to timber construction would on its own cut the building industrys carbon emissions by 31  granted that will be a difficult task but if even a fraction of that can be achieved it could mean a future of timber buildings and greener cities tags decarbonisation  engineering  technology how quickly will these countries reach their climate targets 28 june 2017 power generation it was no surprise when president donald trump echoed his election campaign stance and announced his intention to renegotiate  or failing that withdraw the us  from the paris agreement on climate change it raised the question would other countries back away from their own climate change targets in fact many reaffirmed their commitment to the pact and continue their progress towards becoming low carbon economies for those in the european union this means meeting the 2030 climate and energy framework  which sets three key targets for member states cut greenhouse gas ghg emissions by at least 40 from 1990 levels produce at least 27 of their energy through renewable sources and improve energy efficiency by at least 27 many countries across europe however have set climate objectives that go beyond these whether they can meet those goals is another matter portugal what are its climate targets the portuguese government has pressed the eu to go further than its 2030 targets and is aiming for 40 of total energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030  this target is part of its green growth commitment 2030 which also sets out to create more green  or low carbon economy  jobs and improve overall energy efficiency across the country how is it achieving this portugal has rapidly increased its renewable energy production by investing in wind mainly onshore and hydro power although it is rapidly developing its solar capabilities it is also looking at small scale renewable energy generation through wave thermal and biomass power portugal has two operational coal plants that together are responsible for 16 of the countrys carbon emissions however the government is seeking to phase these out prior to 2025 how is it doing so far the growth in renewable energy within the power industry specifically has been a big success story for portugal in 2005 renewables accounted for only 16 of total electricity production  by 2015 they produced an average of 52 the country made headlines in may 2016 for running on 100 renewable electricity for four days in a row unsurprisingly this means the government is confident of achieving a target of 31 renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2020 which would mean 574 renewable electricity generation germany what are its climate targets germany set its current climate targets as far back as 2007 it subsequently agreed to the paris agreement and the eus 2014 climate and energy framework added to this the country has its own ambitious aims for 2050  cut ghg emissions by up to 95 compared to 1990 levels with an interim target of 40 by 2020 increase the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to 60 and increase all electricity generated from renewables to 80 how does it plan to achieve this germanys climate action programme 2020 and climate action plan 2050  set out its plans for reducing ghg emissions much of this is based around the energiewende energy transition a strategy that will see the country phaseout nuclear power and decarbonise the economy through renewable energy initiatives according to these plans germanys energy supply must be almost completely decarbonised by 2050 with coal power slowly phased out and replaced with renewables especially wind power the utilisation of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste it also stresses the role of the european union emission trading system to meet targets how is it doing so far between 1990 and 2015 emissions reduced by 27 in 2015 the share of renewable sources in german domestic power consumption amounted to 316 however german energyrelated co₂ emissions rose almost 1 in 2016  despite a fall in coal use and the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources this rise is due in part to an overall increase in energy consumption and an increase in natural gas use and diesel for electricity heat and transport projections from the environment ministry in september 2016 indicated that germany will likely miss its 2020 climate target  uk httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201706adobestock_90651791mp4 what are its climate targets alongside its eu and paris commitments the uk houses of parliament approved the climate change act in 2008 which commits to reducing ghg emissions by at least 80 of 1990 levels by 2050 the act requires the government to set legallybinding carbon budgets  a cap on the amount of ghg emitted in the uk over a fiveyear period the first five carbon budgets have been put into legislation and will run up to 2032 these include reducing emissions 37 below 1990 levels by 2020 and 57 by 2030 a key milestone in the uks decarbonisation is to entirely phase out coal by 2025 which will mean either closing or converting as in the case of drax power station  existing coal power stations how does it plan to achieve this under its legally binding carbon budget system  every tonne of ghg emitted between now and 2050 will count where emissions rise in one sector of the economy be it agriculture heavy industry power transport etc the uk must achieve corresponding falls in another the uks initial focus has been to transition to renewable electricity production wind biomass and solar power have all grown significantly aided by government support and by initiatives like the carbon price floor how is it doing so far the uks progress towards its targets is positive but leaves room for improvement renewables generated 149 of the uks electricity in 2013 in 2015 they accounted for nearly a quarter of electricity generation and by 2016 low carbon power sources contributed an average of 40 of the uks power  with wind generating more power than coal for the first time ever the department for business energy and industrial strategy estimates that as of 2016 ghg emissions fell 42 since 1990  despite this the committee on climate change ccc has said that the government is not on track to meet its pledge of cutting emissions 80 by 2050  however it points out the uk is likely to meet the target of making electricity almost entirely lowcarbon by early 2030s but only if further steps are taken such as including increasing investment in more lowcarbon generation such as biomass and developing carbon capture and storage ccs technologies the uk government is due to publish an emissions reduction plan in the autumn of 2017 norway what are its climate targets norways climate policy is based on agreements reached in the storting the norwegian parliament in 2008 and 2012 they stipulate a commitment to reduce global ghg emissions by at least 30 by 2020 from 1990 levels the government also approved the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as well as signing the paris agreement norway has aligned itself with the european unions climate target and intends to fulfil its commitment collectively with the eu of which it is not a member state this means using the eu emissions trading market international cooperation on emissions reductions and projectbased cooperation how does it plan to achieve this around 98 of norways electricity production already comes from renewable energy sources mostly through its more than 900 hydropower plants the remainder is through wind and thermal power norway exports hydropower to the netherlands and exchanges renewable energy with denmark sweden and finland there are plans for
