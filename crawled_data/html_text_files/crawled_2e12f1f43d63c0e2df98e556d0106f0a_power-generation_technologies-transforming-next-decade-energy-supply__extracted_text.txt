future 5 september 2017 power generation in the last decade britains energy system has seen a fundamental shift towards cleaner and renewable energy and while proactive governmental policy has played a large role much of what has made this shift possible is technological improvement innovations in energy technology will play an equally major role in ensuring the same level of progression over the next 10 years a report by national grid has identified some of the most promising of these emerging tech solutions and outlines which have the highest probability of aiding our continued decarbonisation future scenarios aside whats certain from looking at this years electric insights is that a decade from now the power system will look very different these are the technologies that could change it homes that power themselves solar is already an important part of britains renewable power infrastructure but it has the potential to grow through smaller domestic setups too access to diy rooftop solar is becoming increasingly prevalent with even home store giant ikea allowing customers to pick up a solar panel and battery system alongside flatpack furniture meanwhile solar technology continues to improve helping it become more easily integrated into buildings tesla is soon to introduce solar arrays that look almost identical to highend roofing tiles as well as transparent solar powergenerating windows homeowners and business are also looking to onsite biomass boilers to take control of their own green energy as such systems reach mainstream consumers they present the potential to create a more decentralised energy system  photo courtesy of kite power systems a new type of wind energy  powered by kites wind is already a key source of renewable energy with on and offshore wind turbines now commonplace in many parts of the uk but innovation continues and now companies are looking to higher altitudes to improve the efficiency of wind generation in may of this year the uk gave the go ahead to the worlds first kite farm a wind generation facility that will use two massive kites flying in loops roughly 450 metres above the ground to pull turbines and generate electricity the company behind the project kite power systems  claims the system offers a lower levelised cost of energy lcoe and operational maintenance cost than conventional wind bigger more efficient batteries many of the technologies set to shape the future of green energy from domestic solar to electric vehicles evs  are dependent on innovations in battery technology solid state batteries which use a solid electrolyte rather than the semiliquid type found in standard lithiumion batteries offer a number of potential performance benefits  these include six times faster charging twice the energy density and a longer life cycle the challenge is producing the batteries at a large scale and a competitive price point companies including dyson bosch tesla and toyota are all making strides in bringing them to market with the latter aiming to implement the technology by 2020  wind turbines that dont turn the wind turbine has become an icon of renewable energy but this could change  not because of a decrease in wind energy but in a transformation in how they look innovation in the wind energy space has led to the development of bladeless turbines which offer the potential to reduce costs and minimise the noise and visual impact associated with traditional turbines rather than rotating blades bladeless turbines oscillate as wind passes a single conical mast spanish bladeless turbine developer vortex claims the lack of contact between moving parts can cut 80 of maintenance costs due to there being no need for lubricants and spare parts replacements the firm hopes to bring industrialsized turbines to the market by the turn of the decade the next generation of nuclear the next generation of nuclear reactor technology could offer the potential for more efficient economic and safer nuclear energy current solutions being developed include reactors cooled by lead and gas and a molten salt reactor which uses molten fluoride salt to dissolve fuel hopes for these generation iv reactors include the ability to work faster and more efficiently delivering more energy from the same amount of fuels and the ability to use waste products from older reactors the first generation iv systems are expected to be ready for commercial construction around 2020 to 2030 the renewable technologies set to thrive beyond 2030 while the immediate future holds massive potential for a handful of energy technologies there are others that will take longer to come to fruition once realised however they could provide significant breakthroughs methane hydrate found primarily under permafrost and near the ocean floor is thought to offer greater supplies of methane than all the planets natural gas and oil sources combined burnt as a natural gas methane releases much less co 2 than other hydrocarbons and can greatly reduce transport emission when used as a liquefied natural gas lng in vehicles finding a way to safely extract these methane deposits could provide as much as 1500 years worth of energy at current production rates meanwhile the greatly reduced release of radioactive material from nuclear fusion over nuclear fission could offer a huge advantage in its development as a future energy technology there is however no magic bullet that will be the single solution to a cleaner energy future instead like todays power system it will rely on a mix of technologies fuels and generators working together to ensure a stable  and cleaner  energy system share related stories press releases on pawtrol sparky the robodog enhances safety at uks
