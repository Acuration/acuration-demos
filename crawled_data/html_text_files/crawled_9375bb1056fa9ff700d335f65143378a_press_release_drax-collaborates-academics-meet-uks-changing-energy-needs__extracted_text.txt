is working with the university of sheffield on research which could help to revolutionise the uks energy future the company which owns the countrys largest power station near selby in north yorkshire is sponsoring three phd projects at the university having transformed half of its coal fired power station to sustainable biomass to become the uks largest single site renewable generator drax is also developing four rapid response gas power stations in addition it recently announced it is exploring options for repowering some of its coal units to gas and developing battery storage to help support the uks changing energy needs draxs retail businesses haven power and opus energy are increasingly working with customers to help them manage their energy use to reduce bills and their impact on the environment dorothy thompson drax group ceo said the energy sector is changing beyond recognition in the uk and modern companies like drax are transforming with it the work with the university of sheffield will help us to deliver on our aim of changing the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future the projects drax is working on with the university of sheffields centre for doctoral training in energy storage and its applications are aimed at increasing understanding of developing technologies to enable drax to support the uks energy system in the future the phds will focus on topics including use of flow batteries for grid support customer interaction with vehicle to grid systems using smart technology cleaning of exhaust streams for small power generators jason shipstone head of drax groups research and innovation team said flexibility is already important for the uks electricity system but its going to become vital as we continue to decarbonise and more electric vehicles take to the roads without the right storage and flexibility the uks power systems will struggle to meet the increasing demand this collaboration with the university of sheffield will provide us with insights which i believe could help us to deliver better smarter solutions for our future energy needs the research on flow batteries will look at grid scale storage and the possible use of flow batteries versus other storage technology flow batteries have the potential to offer longer life are faster to charge and deliver high storage capacities compared to other technologies the project on vehicle to grid systems is focused on the impact of human behaviour on smart energy technologies this will be an integral part of the future systems required to enable electric cars to store excess power from the grid  like a fleet of small batteries and then release the power again when needed the exhaust cleaning research will look at ways of using exhaust scrubbing technology in combination with small diesel or rapid response gas to reduce the environmental impact of these essential assets as they plug the gaps at times of system stress  such as when the wind doesnt blow or the sun doesnt shine dr solomon brown deputy director of the centre for doctoral training in energy storage and its applications at the university of sheffield said we are delighted the drax group have decided to work with us to develop their business in response to the changing energy economy consumer demands and how energy needs to be generated energy storage is a critical translational technology for the uk and this collaboration indicates commitment to low carbon energy generation and deployment the research work will be carried out by phd students at the university of sheffield over three years from october drax is also collaborating with the university on a potential fourth phd in distributed energy storage which may be starting in 2018 the work on distributed energy storage is likely to look at ways of optimising storage assets within a small community to provide ancillary services to the grid such as demand management frequency response and load shifting candidates interested in applying for this fourth phd can find out more online  ends media contact ali lewis drax group head of media relations e email protected t 01757 612165 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 01757 612848 editors notes since upgrading half of its power station in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass from coal more than two thirds of the power drax produces is renewable delivering carbon savings of 68 compared to gas it is now the uks largest single site renewable electricity generator producing 17 of the countrys renewable power enough for four million homes drax is also developing four rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt projects the first of which could be operational in 202021 these projects based in england and wales are rapid response gas power stations which will be able to be up and running quickly at times of system stress such as when the sun doesnt shine or the wind doesnt blow by providing this kind of system support these ocgts will enable more intermittent renewables like wind and solar onto the system helping the uk to decarbonise in addition the drax group has also announced it is exploring options for repowering up to two coal units to gas and building battery storage at drax power station the options could create up to 36gw of new gas generation capacity and 200mw of battery storage the upgrade would enhance drax power stations flexible and responsive capability and make yorkshire the home of large scale battery technology the phd projects at the university of sheffield include use of flow batteries for grid support flow batteries are a technology that have the advantage over other competitor battery energy storage technologies of longer live quick response times and almost instantly rechargeable this makes them potentially ideal for use at large scale for supporting the electricity grid given their reliability this project seeks to perform a detailed technoeconomic comparison between grid scale battery storage and the use of flow cell agent based modelling of customer interaction with vehicle to grid systems this project will develop an agentbased model for the use of an electrical car charging facility utilised as part of a vehicletogrid v2g scheme the model will incorporate the behaviour of the individual users of the facility and factors which impact its use for example the impact battery degradation has on vehicle performance will be included which is expected to impact the takeup of such a scheme following this control and scheduling of the batteries as a grid service will be added once this model has been developed it will be used to investigate both the robustness of the system to the variable behaviour of the vehicles owners and tariff or funding regimes that may be used to encourage their takeup while for example remunerating customers for the degradation in the lifetime of the vehicle the project will make benefit from the substantial work in v2g already being performed in the cdt in particular in the scheduling and control of v2g systems as well as behavioural aspects of the interaction with such a v2g system cleaning of exhaust streams from small generators in an energy system with an increasing amount of renewable energy from which electricity production can be intermittent there is a need for the ability to quickly replace wind and solar sources when their contribution drops for this grid support role hydrocarbon generators such as diesel and open cycle gas turbines are important as they capable of being brought online almost immediately the purpose of this project is reduce the environmental impact of these essential assets the projects seeks to perform a modelbased design and technoeconomic analysis to study the cleaning of exhausts of small generators for example diesel or ocgt the study will use existing technologies as a baseline eg ccs and catalytic reduction and select and adapt those most appropriate to the smaller scale generators of interest a constraint in this is exhaust streams composition which must be accounted for given that require particular attention given the deleterious effect that some species have on performance eg nox importantly the system must be designed such that it can operate in a transient manner alongside these small generators given their use as backup generation further an experimental element of the project may also be included to test at bench scale key components of the design about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is
