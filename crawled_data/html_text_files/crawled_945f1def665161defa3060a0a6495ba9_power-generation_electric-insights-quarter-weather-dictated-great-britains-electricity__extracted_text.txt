power station the quarter when weather dictated great britains electricity subzero temperatures sent electricity demand skyward but the energy systems held firm 16 may 2018 power generation as summer arrives in great britain bringing the hottest may day bank holiday on record its hard to believe march saw the coldest spring day since records began but thats exactly what happened during the six days the beast from the east hit europe from 26 february to 3 march great britains weather sunk to a onceinadecade level of cold dipping on 1 march when thermometers dropped to an average of 38 degrees celsius across central england these extreme conditions drove electricity demand up 10 as darker days required extra lighting and more people plugged in energyintensive electric heaters to keep warm after successive years of milder winters  january to march made for a period in which the weather played a pivotal role in dictating how the countrys electricity was generated according to electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report highlights how despite the storm disrupting power transmission in parts of the country and sensationalist headlines suggesting lights could go out at any moment the electricity system held up well in the adverse conditions the beast from the east tests energy security the subzero temperatures brutal wind and siberianlevel snow blizzards that hit great britain for six days between february and march proved a real test for the electricity system the evening of 1 march saw demand reach 533 gw  its highest peak in three years this had a knockon effect on the hourahead price of electricity which was 50 higher during march than the same period in 2017 the weather had a notable impact on the types of generation needed to power the county with fossil fuels playing an important role at the expense of carbon emission levels over the sixday cold spell fossil fuels averaged between 2025 gw of electricity generation coal accounted for almost 10 of the total electricity mix across the quarter in part because of rising gas prices which made it a more economical fuel gas however remained the biggest power source accounting for just shy of 40 of all electricity what is most significant about this q1 2018 fossil fuel usage is that even in such extreme weather coal and gas generation was still 16 and 2 lower respectively than the same quarter in 2017 this drop is the result of increased renewable capacity allowing wind generation to grow by almost 40 and make up just short of 20 of the electricity mix read the full articles here the beast from the east who helped and hindered the system rampant wind leads renewable generation the conditions brought by the storm where particularly favourable to wind generation which hit new peakgeneration levels of 13 gw on 17 january and then 14 gw on 17 march over the full quarter wind power production reached 15560 gwh 30 gwh more than nuclear the nearest low carbon source this increase comes in part as a result of a 19 increase in installed capacity around the country since q1 2017 but also thanks to the grid getting better at making use of it during the six subzero days of the quarter wind contributed a minimum of 44 gw crucial at a time when other power sources appeared vulnerable for example heavy snowfall blocked solar panels from the sun leaving it contributing just 2 of the electricity mix over the quarter nuclear power fared better and made up just shy of 20 of generation but was held back by two routine reactor maintenances while a third shut on the quarters coldest day due to seaweed clogging a plants cooling system  biomass ran solidly throughout the cold spell contributing 4 of the total electricity generation mix the opening of a new 22 gw cable connecting scotland  where there is 77 gw of installed capacity  to north wales saved national grid some 9 million a month in constraint payments across the first quarter read the full articles wind power breezes past nuclear wind farm curtailment falls by twothirds did the country almost run out of gas one of the most headlinegrabbing events from the cold spell was national grids decision to issue a gas deficit warning on the morning of 1 march suggesting supplies could run out before the end of the day with 83 of british households depending on gas for heating and gas turbines accounting for a significant portion of the countrys electricity generation  the announcement drew considerable press attention however national grid explained domestic gas users would unlikely be impacted and it would work with industrial partners to make more gas available to meet demand this clearly had the desired effect with as much as 19 gw of spare gas capacity ending up available that day the warning was withdrawn the following morning and gas generation averaged 11 gw more than any other source between 26 february and 3 march nevertheless europeanwide demand for gas sent prices soaring and making it more economical to burn coal which generated roughly 10 gw a day on average over the sixday period of 26 february to 3 march read the full article running low on gas the extreme weather of q1 2018 highlighted the stability of great britains overall power system but even as the country continues to move towards greater
