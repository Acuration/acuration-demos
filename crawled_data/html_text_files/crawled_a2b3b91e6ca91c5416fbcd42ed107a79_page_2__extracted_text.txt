tackle the climate crisis global unity and collaboration are needed this was in part the thinking behind the paris agreement it set a clear collective target negotiated at the 2015 united nations climate change conference and signed the following year to keep the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in november 2021 cop26 will see many of the countries who first signed the paris agreement come together in glasgow for the first global stocktake of their environmental progress since its creation cop26 will take place at the sec in glasgow already delayed for a year as a result of the pandemic covid19 and its effects on emissions is likely to be a key talking point so too will progress towards not just the paris agreement goals but those of individual countries known as national determined contributions ndcs these sit under the umbrella of the paris agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries with many countries still reeling from the effects of covid19 the question is which countries are actually on track to meet them what are the goals the ndcs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change these incorporate various targets from decarbonisation and forestry to coastal preservation and financial aims while all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the paris agreement targets not all have an equally sized task the principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions capabilities and economic conditions the universal ecological fund outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters showing that combined they account for 56 of global greenhouse gas emissions china is the largest emitter responsible for 268 followed by the us which contributes 131 the european union and its 28 member states account for nine per cent while india is responsible for seven per cent of all emissions these nations have ambitious emissions goals but are they on track to meet them china traffic jams in the rush hour in shanghai downtown contribute to high emissions in china by 2030 china pledged to reach peak carbon dioxide co 2   increase its nonfossil fuel share of energy supply to 20 and reduce the carbon intensity  the ratio between emissions of co 2 to the output of the economy  by 60 to 65 below 2005 levels covid19 has increased the uncertainty of the course of chinas emissions some projections show that emissions are likely to grow in the short term before peaking and levelling out sometime between 2021 and 2025 however according to the climate action tracker it is also possible that chinas emissions have already peaked  specifically in 2019 china is expected to meet its nonfossil energy supply and carbon intensity pledges united states the forecast for the second largest emitter the us has also been affected by the pandemic economic firm rhodium group has predicted that the us could see its emissions drop between 20 and 27 by 2025 meeting its target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels however president trumps rolling back of obamaera climate policies and regulations his support of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the paris agreement effective from as early as 4 november 2020 suggest any achievement may not be longlasting the united states coronavirus aid relief and economic security act known as the cares act does not include any direct support to clean energy development  something that could also change in 2021 european union carl clayton head of beccs at drax inspects pipework in the ccus area of drax power station the european union and its member states then including the uk pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40 below 1990 levels by 2030  a target the climate action tracker estimates will be achieved in fact the eu is on track to cut emissions by 58 by 2030 this progress is in part a result of a large package of measures adopted in 2018 these accelerated the emissions reductions including national coal phaseout plans increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency the package also introduced legally binding annual emission limits for each member state within which they can set individual targets to meet the common goal the uk has not yet released an updated independent ndc however it has announced a 350 million package designed to cut emissions in heavy industry and drive economic recovery from covid19 this includes 139 million earmarked to scale up hydrogen production as well as carbon capture and storage ccs technology such as bioenergy with carbon capture beccs  essential technologies in achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and protecting industrial regions  india india the fourth largest global emitter is set to meet its pledge to reduce its emissions intensity by 33 to 35 below 2005 levels and increase the

technologies today our organisations have launched a new coalition with a shared vision to build back better as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery from covid19 by developing pioneering projects that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  and other pollutants from the atmosphere together we represent hundreds of thousands of workers across some of the uks most critical industries including aviation energy and farming each of which contribute billions of pounds each year to the economy a growing number of independent experts including the committee on climate change royal society and royal academy of engineering and the electricity system operator have recognised the crucial role of negative emissions or greenhouse gas removal technologies in fighting the climate crisis whilst we should seek to decarbonise sectors such as aviation heavy industry and agriculture as far as practically possible due to technical or commercial barriers it is unlikely we will eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions completely negative emissions technologies are critical therefore to balancing out these residual emissions and ensuring we achieve net zero in a credible cost effective and sustainable way as well as benefiting the environment negative emissions technologies and projects can build back a cleaner greener economy in the wake of covid19 the foundations for this are already being laid by our coalitions members today for example the national farmers union has set out a net zero vision for the agricultural sector whereby uk farmers harness the ability to capture carbon to create new income streams the aviation industry through the sustainable aviation initiative has identified negative emissions projects alongside other measures as sustainable jet fuel as being crucial to greening the industry in north yorkshire drax is developing plans to combine sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology beccs to create the worlds first carbon negative power station  supporting thousands of jobs in the process in north east lincolnshire velocys with the support of british airways is developing the altalto wastetojet fuel project that could produce negativeemission jet fuel once the humber industrial clusters carbon capture and storage infrastructure is established finally carbon engineering has announced a partnership with pale blue dot energy to deploy commercialscale direct air capture projects in the uk that would remove significant volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with cop26 fast approaching there is a real and compelling opportunity for the uk government to demonstrate to the world it is taking a leadership position on negative emissions conversely if the uk does not act quickly it could jeopardise the delivery of projects in the 2020s that can support innovation learning by doing and the scaleup of negative emissions in the 2030s it also risks britain falling behind in the race to scale and commercialise these technologies with a view to exporting them to other countries around the world to support their own decarbonisation efforts we therefore call on this government supported by your departments to pursue the following low regrets interventions to support this critical emerging industry adopt a clear unambiguous commitment to supporting negative emissions in the 2020s and beyond the last significant reference to negative emissions by government was in the 2017 clean growth strategy between now and the end of the year there is a window of opportunity for the government to go further reflecting the changed reality of a net zero world and the growing consensus on the need for negative emissions a clear signal of intent would also give greater confidence to investors and developers in negative emissions projects in the absence of a longterm strategy develop targeted policies to support viable negative emissions projects in the 2020s  in order to scale up in the 2030s at a pace compatible with the uks climate commitments it is essential that government works with industry to bring forward early projects in the 2020s that are viable and represent value for money however there is no marketplace or regulatory regime in the uk today that incentivises or rewards negative emissions making financing projects extremely challenging dedicated policy frameworks and business models for solutions such as afforestation beccs and direct air capture are therefore urgently needed seize the opportunity to make negative emissions a point of emphasis at cop26  the uk has already led the way at a global level by adopting net zero as a legally binding target at cop26 the uk can showcase its further commitment to continuous innovation around the decarbonisation agenda by signposting the early actions it has taken to deploy negative emissions  which other countries will also need to meet their own zero carbon ambitions this statement would be particularly powerful as it can be credibly supported by several pioneering projects already being undertaken by british businesses and research organisations in this space we would welcome the opportunity to meet with each of you to

last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation

reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate

the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint track our progress at towards carbon negative   in this article weve simplified our explanation of net zero carbon dioxide co 2  is the most abundant greenhouse

country electricity is accessible and safe to use for just about everyone every day widescale blackouts are very rare but they do happen on 9 august 2019 a power cut saw more than 1 million people and services lose power for just under an hour it was the first largescale blackout since 2013 although this proves the network is not infallible the fact it was such an outlier in the normal performance of the grid highlights its otherwise exemplary stability and reliability but what is it exactly that makes an electricity system stable and reliable at its core system stability comes down to two key factors a country or regions ability to generate enough electricity and its ability to then transport it through a transmission system to where its needed when everything is running smoothly an electricity system is described as being balanced  in this state supply meets demand exactly and all necessary conditions  such as voltage and frequency  are right for the safe and efficient transport of electricity any slight deviation or mismatch across any of these factors can cause power stations or infrastructure to trip and cut off power a recent report by electric insights identified the countries around the world with most reliable power systems in which the uk was fourth it offers an insight into what factors contribute to building a stable system as well as those that hold some countries back generation and reliable infrastructure according to the report france has the most reliable electricity system of any country with a population of more than five million people having gone a decade without a power outage one reason for this is the countrys fleet of 58 statecontrolled nuclear power stations which generate huge amounts of consistent baseload power in 2017 nuclear power made up more than 70 of frances electricity generation while hydropower accounted for another 10 of the 475 terawatt hours twh consumed across the county that year penly nuclear power station near dieppe france now as its nuclear stations age france is increasing its renewable power generation as these sources are often weather dependent imports from and exports to its neighbours are expected to become a more important part of keeping the french network stable at times when there is little sunlight or wind  or too much importing and exporting electricity is also key to switzerlands power system third most reliable network on the list with 41 bordercrossing power lines allowing the country to serve as a crossroads for power flowing between italy and germany it means its total imports and exports can often exceed electricity production within the country electricity pylons in switzerland switzerlands mountainous landscape also means ensuring a reliable electricity system requires a carefully maintained transmissions system the swiss grid is 6700 kilometres long and uses 40000 hitech metering points along it to record and process around 10000 data points in seconds  the key to the stability of south korea  the second most stable network on the list  is also its imports but rather than actual megawatts it comes in the form of oil gas and coal the country is the worlds fourth biggest coal importer and its coal power stations account for 42 of its total generation seoul south korea however in the face of urban smog issues and global decarbonisation goals it is pursuing a switch to renewables this can come with repercussions to stability so south korea is also investing in transmission infrastructure including a new interconnector from the east of the country to seoul its main source of electricity consumption it highlights that if decarbonisation is going to accelerate at the pace needed to meet paris agreement targets then many of the worlds most stable and reliable electricity systems need to go through significant change balance will be needed between meeting decarbonisation targets with overall system stability however there are many countries around the world that focus less on ensuring consistent stability through decarbonisation and are instead more focused on how to achieve stability in the first place stalling generation the democratic republic of congo is the eleventhlargest country on earth it is rich with minerals and resources yet it is the least electrified nation just 9 of people have access to power in rural areas that number drops to just 1 and the country suffers blackouts more than once a month as a result of load shedding when there isnt enough power to meet demand so parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to prevent the entire system failing currently the country has just 27 gw of installed electricity capacity 25 gw of which comes from hydropower  the countrys inga dam facility on the congo river has the potential to generate more electricity than any other single source of power on the planet its thought the proposed grand inga site could produce as much as 40 gw  twice that of chinas three gorges dam and provide electricity to a massive part of southern africa a legacy of political instability in the country however has so far made securing financing difficult congo river democratic republic of congo nigeria is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and with that comes rapidly rising demand for electricity however just 45 of the country is currently electrified and of these areas many still suffer outages at least once a month the country has 125 gw of installed capacity most of which comes from thermal gas stations but technical problems in power stations and infrastructure mean it is often only capable of generating as much as 5 gw to transmit on to end consumers this limited production capability means it often fails to meet demand resulting in outages the problem has been prolonged by struggling utility companies that are unable to make the investments needed to stabilise electricity supply keen to resolve what it has referenced as an energy supply crisis the nigerian government recently secured a 1 billion credit line from the world bank to improve access to electricity across the country the investment will focus in part on securing the transmission system from theft thus allowing the private utility companies to generate the revenue needed to improve generation transmission holding back emerging systems balancing transmissions systems is a crucial part of stable electricity networks maintaining a steady frequency that delivers safe usable electricity into homes and businesses is at the crux of reliability even countries that can generate enough electricity are held back if they cant efficiently get the electricity to where it is needed brazil has an abundance of hydropower installed its 97 gw of hydro accounts for more than 70 of the countrys electricity mix  however the countrys dams are largely concentrated around the amazon basin in the north west whereas demand comes from cities in the south and eastern coastline transporting electricity across long distances between generator and consumer makes it difficult to maintain the correct voltage and frequency needed to keep a stable and reliable flow of electricity as a result brazil suffers a blackout every onetothree months hydropower plant henry borden in the serra do mar brazil the country is tackling its transmissions problems by diversifying its electricity mix to include greater levels of solar and wind off its east coast  closer to many of its major cities the country has also looked to new technology for solutions at the start of the decade as much as 8 of all electricity being generated in brazil was being stolen  reaching as high as 40 in some areas these illegal hookups both damage infrastructure making it less reliable as well as blur the true demand making grid management challenging brazil has since deployed smart meters to measure electricitys journey from power stations to end users more accurately allowing operators to spot anomalies sooner electricity theft is a major problem in many developing regions with as much as 10 billion worth of power lost each year in india which suffers blackouts as often as brazil it highlights that even when there is generation to meet demand maintaining stability at a large scale requires constant attention and innovation as new challenges arise this looks different around the world some countries might face challenges in shifting from stable thermalbased systems to renewables others are attempting to build stability into newly connected networks but no matter where in the world electricity is being used ensuring reliability is an everongoing task electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent

electricity generation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy policy the policy needed to save the future 6 december 2019 carbon capture over the past decade the united kingdom has decarbonised significantly as coal power has been replaced by sources like biomass wind and solar every year power generation emits fewer and fewer tonnes of carbon thanks to renewables and with the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars coming in no later than 2040 roads and urban areas are about to get cleaner too however there are still tough challenges ahead if the uk is to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050 aviation heavy industry agriculture shipping power generation  some of the key activities of daily economic life  all remain reliant on fuels that emit carbon this is where greenhouse gas removal ggr technologies have a big role to play these can capture carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and either store them or use them helping the drive towards carbon neutrality while the idea of being able to capture carbon has been around for some time the technology is fast catching up with the ambition there now exist a number of credible solutions that allow for capturing emissions the challenge however is putting in place the framework and policies needed to enable technologies to be implemented at scale time is short a recent report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis emphasised the need for government action now if we are to achieve the volume of carbon removal needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the tech to take emissions out of the atmosphere the planet naturally absorbs co 2  forests absorb it as they grow mangroves trap it in flooded soils and oceans absorb it from the air so harnessing this power through planting growing and actively managing forests is one natural method of ggr that can be easily implemented by policy aerial view of mangrove forest and river on the siargao island philippines the idea of using technology to capture co 2 and prevent its release into the atmosphere has been around since the 1970s it was first deployed successfully in enhanced oil recovery  when captured emissions are injected into underground oil reserves to help remove the oil from the ground over time its been developed and is now in place in a number of fossil fuel power stations around the world allowing them to cut emissions  however by combining the same technology with renewable fuels like compressed biomass wood pellets we can generate electricity that is carbon negative  each of these solutions operate in different ways but all are important vivid economics report emphasises that a range of different solutions will be required to reach a point where 130 million tonnes of co 2 mtco 2  are being removed from the atmosphere in the uk annually by 2050 however investment and clear government planning and guidance will be crucial in enabling the growth of grr the report estimates largescale ggr could cost around 13 billion per year by 2050 in the uk alone a figure similar in size to current government support for renewables if you went back 20odd years people were sceptical of the role of wind solar and biomass and whether the technologies would ever get to a cost point where they could be viably deployed at scale explains drax policy analyst richard gow in the last few years weve seen enormous cost reductions in renewables and people are far more confident in investing in them  that has been driven by very good government policy ggr needs the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  but what shape should those policies take for them to be effective options for policies perhaps the most straightforward route to enabling ggr is to build on existing policies for example there are existing tree planting schemes such as the woodland carbon fund woodland carbon code and the country stewardship scheme all of which could receive greater regulatory support or additional rules obliging emitters to invest in actively managed forests  more technically complex solutions like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs could be incentivised by alternative mechanisms in order to provide clarity on and to stabilise revenue streams these are already used to support companies building lowcarbon power generation such as through the contracts for difference scheme and have been effective in encouraging investment in projects with high upfront costs and longpayback periods alternative options to support the rollout of negative emissions technologies should also be considered for example the government could make it obligatory for companies that contribute to emissions to pay for ggr to avoid increased burden on electricity consumers in such a scenario fossil fuel suppliers would be required to offset the emissions of their products by buying negative emissions certificates from ggr providers as a result the price of fossil fuels for users would likely rise to cover this expense and the costs would then be shared across the supply chain rather than just a single party another approach that passes the costs of ggr deployment on to emitters is using emissions taxes to fund tax credits for ggr providers making these tax credits tradable would also mean any large taxpaying company such as a supermarket or bank could buy tax credits from ggr providers this approach would come at no cost to government as sales of the tax credits would be funded by an emissions tax and would offer revenue to ggr providers the challenge with tax credits however is they are vulnerable to changes in government an alternative is to offer direct grants and longterm contracts with ggr providers which would ensure funding for projects that transcends changes in parliament they could however prove costly for government whatever policy pathway the government may choose to follow there are underlying foundations needed to support effective ggr deployment making policies work there are still many unknown factors in ggr deployment such as the precise volume that will be needed to counter hardtoabate emissions this means all policy must be flexible to allow for future changes and the individual requirements of different regions forestbased solutions might suit some regions daccs might be better in others underlying the strength of any of these policies is the need for accurate carbon accounting understanding how much emissions are removed from the atmosphere by each technology will be key to reaching a true net zero status and giving credibility to certificates and tax credits pearl river nursery mississippi proper accounting of different technologies impact will also be crucial in delivering innovation grants these can come through the uks existing innovation structure and will be fundamental to jumpstarting the pilot programmes needed to test the viability of ggr approaches before commercialisation different approaches to ggr have different levels of effectiveness as well as different costs beccs for example serves two purposes in both generating lowcarbon power and capturing emissions  resulting in overall negative emissions across the supply chain its important to account for the full value chain of beccs explains gow therefore it should be rewarded through two mechanisms a cfd for the clean electricity produced and an incentive for the negative emissions a double policy here is important because you are providing two products which benefit different sectors of the economy one benefits power consumers and the other provides a service to society and the environment as a whole and cost should be apportioned as such beccs and daccs also have to consider wider supply chains such as carbon transport and storage infrastructure  although this requires a high initial investment by connecting to industrial emitters it can enable providers to recover the costs through charges to multiple network users ultimately the key to making any ggr policies work effectively and efficiently is speed in order to put in place accounting principles test different methods and begin courting investors government needs to act now the vivid economics report is further confirmation of the vital role that beccs will play in reaching a net zerocarbon economy and the need to deploy the uks first commercial project in the 2020s drax

generation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy policy  flexibility and stability and power system security  investors  national grid maintaining electricity grid stability during rapid decarbonisation 13 november 2019 power generation great britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the
