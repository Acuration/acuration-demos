rethinking the uks future energy mix since the climate change summit in paris theres been a lot of talk about how we can remove coal from the energy mix in the uk and limit further climate change writes drax power ceo andy koss andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 13 january 2016 opinion since the climate change summit in paris theres been a lot of talk about how we can remove coal from the energy mix in the uk and limit further climate change one way would be to close down all the coalfired power stations but coal still provides more than 20 per cent of the uks electricity and the department for energy and climate change decc predicts we will need almost 20 more electricity by 2035  not less chart below whats more building new capacity to replace those power stations would take years while buying in extra supplies of energy at short notice can mean extra costs being passed on to customers the good news is that at drax weve already developed a solution to the challenge as i told the yorkshire post recently  were doing it by converting our coalfired generating units to use compressed wood pellets and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk in fact were now producing more electricity from wood pellets than from coal at drax and were doing it day in day out in all around four per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are now being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax this enables us to take lowgrade wood and compress it into small highdensity pellets to use in our specially adapted generating units even including a minimal quantity of carbon emissions in the supply chain conversions still cut greenhouse gases by over 80 compared to coal  if we can get the support to convert the other three generating units at the power station then well cease using coal at drax this would help the governments proposed target date of ending unabated coal electricity generation in the uk by 2025  i think at a very high level that support is there we all know that wind and solar energy have the potential to take a bigger role in britains energy mix but to do so they need to be accompanied by another technology that can be turned up to fill gaps when the weather means they produce less energy than required our highdensity wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can do this looking to the future as wind and solar grow and britain becomes more dependent on them it will be ever more important to have this reliable renewable support on hand were well behind our european neighbours in using wood pellets for energy  and a long way behind countries like germany and sweden taking steps to catch up with the european average is the fastest most affordable and most reliable way to move away from coal to the renewable fuels of the future to take those steps energy companies like drax and the government need more dialogue share most read electrification storage
