Press Release
GB Railfreight and Drax Extend Rail Contract to Transport Biomass Until 2025
6 August 2020
Press releases

GB Railfreight (GBRf) and Drax have agreed to extend their contract to transport supplies of sustainable biomass from UK ports to Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire until 2025.
Teams at GBRf have worked closely with Drax for the past decade to maintain the supplies of sustainable biomass needed for the UK’s largest power station to continue generating the flexible and reliable renewable power for millions of UK homes and businesses. This deal is critical to Drax’s global biomass supply chain and another step on its journey to negative emissions.
Drax supplies 11% of the UK’s renewable electricity. Using sustainable biomass instead of coal at Drax Power Station has reduced emissions by more than 80% and helped the UK power system decarbonise faster than any other country in Europe.
Under the terms of the contract, GBRf will run all of Drax tonnage from the Ports of Tyne and Liverpool to Drax Power Station.
The partnership between GBRf and Drax dates back to 2010 when GBRf began moving biomass by rail from the Port of Tyne. Originally, GBRf used wagons that had been converted from coal hoppers by adding lids and these remain in use under the new contract. As Drax converted more of its coal units at the power station to sustainable biomass, Drax invested in new purpose-built biomass wagons that are larger and therefore more efficient at carrying the pellets.
In the past year, the longstanding relationship between Drax and GBRf has helped overcome challenges such as the local floods in February to the Drax branch line and then the Covid-19 crisis, ensuring continuous flows of biomass that helped keep the power station running and the lights on in Britain.
John Smith, Managing Director of GB Railfreight, said:
“I am delighted to be continuing GB Railfreight’s ongoing partnership with Drax. We will continue to deliver vital supplies of sustainable biomass for a further five years, ensuring power is generated in a clean and sustainable way as well as reducing the UK’s carbon emissions.
“The announcement also comes at a time of great economic uncertainty for our country. We at GBRf remain committed to getting the UK economy back on track and having worked with Drax over the last few months during testing times I know we will continue to work closely in the months and years to come as we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.”
Mike Maudsley, UK Portfolio Generation Director at Drax said:
“GBRf’s rail deliveries are a critical part of our global supply chain for sustainable biomass that supports thousands of jobs and has delivered economic growth across the north of England, while supplying renewable electricity to millions of homes and businesses.
“We’re very pleased to extend our existing contract with GBRf for another five years and we’re looking forward to continuing to work with the team.”

Community views sought on Drax plans
Press releases

Local people are being asked to give their views on proposals Drax has to demolish some disused infrastructure at its power station near Selby, and to develop its biomass handling facilities.
The two remaining coal generation units at Drax will be turned off in March next year, leaving behind some supporting infrastructure which will no longer be needed, including the plant’s Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system.
Drax has transformed the power station by converting four generating units to use sustainable biomass to produce 11% of the country’s renewable electricity. Because biomass produces much lower levels of sulphur than coal, the FGD system has become obsolete and will no longer be required.
Alongside the FGD demolition, Drax  is investigating the possibility of developing its biomass handling facilities. This could include silos similar to the plant’s existing storage and conveyor systems being constructed. The existing limestone and gypsum storage buildings could also be re-utilised to handle biomass after Drax stops using coal.
Following consultation with the local community, the plans will be submitted to Selby District Council for consideration. The public can safely view and provide feedback on the proposals using Drax’s interactive virtual planning exhibition, which can be accessed on the website at
www.drax.com/uk/VirtualConsultation

Ground-breaking carbon recycling project launches with £3million Innovate UK funding
17 July 2020
Press releases

The project will obtain critical data about a new single-cell protein used in fish and poultry feed that is set to sustainably transform the UK’s aquaculture and poultry industries.
REACT-FIRST is the UK’s first-ever scalable route to the sustainable generation of protein capturing the carbon dioxide from bio-energy generation. It launches with financial support from the government in the form of £3M funding from Innovate UK and will contribute to meeting the UK’s Net Zero climate change commitment as well as to the circular economy.
REACT-FIRST is led by carbon recycling biotechnology company
Deep Branch
, which has pioneered a process that uses microbes to convert carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and turns them into high-value proteins.
The project launches with the first-of-its-kind, end-to-end value-chain-wide consortium of ten industry and academic partners, which all share a commitment to tackling the global climate crisis and the goal of achieving neutral / negative carbon emissions. The members of the REACT-FIRST consortium are:
Deep Branch – experts in recycling industrial CO
2
into cost-competitive protein for high-value, sustainable animal feed;
Drax – the UK’s largest single site renewable electricity generator and pioneer of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS);
BioMar – one of the world’s largest aquafeed producers;
AB Agri – a global agri-food business and leading producer of monogastric feed;
Sainsbury’s – recognised as world’s best sustainable seafood retailer in 2017;
Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre (SAIC) – a network of 100+ key stakeholders from the aquaculture industry;
Synthetic Biology Research Centre, University of Nottingham (SBRC Nottingham) – the world-leading gas fermentation research group;
The Institute of Aquaculture, University of Stirling – the UK’s leading aquaculture research centre;
Nottingham Trent University, School of Animal Rural and Environmental Sciences – experts in assessing sustainable poultry production;
Innogen, University of Edinburgh – experts in value chain integration and responsible innovation.
Commenting on the significance of the REACT-FIRST project, Peter Rowe, CEO of Deep Branch, explains:
“Currently, most animal feed protein sources are imported from overseas, making the UK dependent on complicated and fragile supply chains. REACT-FIRST has been created to focus solely on addressing this problem.
“Projects like REACT-FIRST are key to help the industry move towards achieving net-zero emissions. Its solution uses the technology developed by Deep Branch, but whilst this has huge transformative potential, commercialisation is not possible without cooperation with key stakeholders across the value chain. REACT-FIRST addresses this, with its consortium of industrial and academic organisations, and even though relationships within these verticals are well established, the project represents the first time that the resources and expertise of all parties have been unified towards a single goal.”
Deep Branch BioTechnology pilot plant within Drax’s CCUS incubation area
The work of REACT-FIRST centres around the use of microbes to convert CO
2
directly from industrial emissions into high-value products, specifically a totally novel, new type of single-cell protein, or SCP, called Proton
TM
produced by Deep Branch. “This is used in fish and poultry feed and represents a new way of generating more sustainable animal feeds,” says Rowe.
“REACT-FIRST will obtain critical data about cost, digestibility, nutritional quality and carbon footprint of Proton
TM
. Each of the project’s partners is playing an active role in the development of the process and generation of this critical data, harnessing their involvement and shared knowledge in the field of carbon emissions, the production supply chain, and ground-breaking biotechnology and technology, to create sustainable protein feed sources that will contribute to reducing the environmental impact of meat production systems.”
Speaking about the REACT-FIRST project,
Science Minister Amanda Solloway
said
:
“To protect our environment and meet our world-leading target of Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, we must harness the very best of UK innovation across all sectors, supporting the most creative and pioneering ideas.
“From robotics assisting our farmers in fruit picking, to technology that converts CO
2
-to clean animal feed, the incredible and cutting-edge projects we are backing today represent the future of farming. Working with the best of British science, we are accelerating the transition to net zero food production, boosting jobs and productivity and driving forward the UK’s economic recovery.”
Melanie Welham, Executive Director, BBSRC, part of UK Research and Innovation, adds:
“This project, and others like it will help increase UK agricultural productivity and global competitiveness. At UKRI our aim is to turnthe food production sector into a beacon of innovation. Brilliant ideas like this one go a long way to making food production more sustainable, efficient and less carbon intensive but they need support to get them from the drawing board to the farm.
“UKRI’s funding programme for this sector is ongoing. In our current funding round we’ve awarded funding to 9 innovative companies. In the future we encourage businesses to come forward with fresh ideas to help UK agriculture.”
REACT-FIRST partners:
Jason Shipstone, EVP Innovation
Drax Group
last year announced its world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 by using Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), and has been working with Deep Branch to explore the feasibility of using its carbon dioxide emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products.
Through the REACT-FIRST project, Drax is providing further support through its expertise in site integration and CO
2
lifecycle analysis, as Drax Group’s Chief Innovation Officer, Jason Shipstone, explains:
“By working with other businesses through the REACT-FIRST consortium, together we can help more difficult to de-carbonise sectors, like agriculture, to make positive changes to address the climate crisis.”
Global innovators in high performance aquaculture feed
BioMar
is involved in production of trial feeds and testing of the high potential raw material Proton
TM
, focusing on sustainability, performance, digestibility and other parameters essential for fish health and growth.
Paddy Campbell, VP Salmon at BioMar Group, explains:
“Aquaculture is expected to double production by 2050 however to achieve this we need feeds with minimal environmental impact. The REACT-FIRST      project is the first step towards the commercial development of a new potentially game-changing protein source, Proton
TM
; using new technology to capture waste CO
2
and creating high-value sustainable protein suitable for the aquaculture industry.
“At BioMar we are constantly seeking innovative raw materials that don’t compete with human food production and nutrients from by-products that minimise waste. We are excited to be part of this project to see how Proton
TM
will perform in aquaculture feed,”

stated Paddy Campbell VP Salmon, BioMar Group.

AB Agri’s
role in REACT-FIRST is to complement the work of its consortium’s technology and science partners with its insights into animal feed markets, customer needs and end consumer demands. The agri-food company uses its expertise and experience to ensure end products are viable, and plays an integral role in driving a more responsible supply of protein around the world.
Valerie Schuster, Strategy Director at AB Agri, comments:
“The world around us is changing. In the past, there has been a growing gap between the animal feed industry and end consumers, who nowadays want to know more about the meat and fish they are eating, where they come from and whether the animals they consume have been raised responsibly. In turn, the industry is obliged to share more information about the feed animals consume, where it comes from, and how we do more with less to meet the needs of a growing population, while preserving the planet.
“REACT-FIRST provides a way of doing exactly this: by growing single-cell protein using CO
2
emissions from industry, it creates a new, scalable and circular protein, which is the opportunity to help feed manufacturers and farmers and improve animal nutrition and wellbeing via a high-quality ingredient that is consistent and can easily be traced back to its origins.”
Scientists from the
University of Stirling’s Institute of Aquaculture
are tasked with investigating the feasibility of microbial single-cell protein (SCP) as a substitute for marine and terrestrial meal in salmon aquafeeds. The Institute’s Dr Mónica Betancor is leading the study, and explains: “The project aims to evaluate and validate a SCP produced from industrial emissions of CO
2
, with an amino acid profile tailored to meet the end-user requirements of the aquafeed industry, and also support and improve the sustainability and development of UK aquaculture by contributing to UK food security.
“Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector, with the UK salmon industry expected to increase significantly. Such growth can only be achieved in a sustainable manner by replacing the traditionally used marine ingredients in aquafeeds – fish meal and fish oil – for more sustainable options. The main alternative to fish meal in aquafeeds is vegetable meal, however, this has its constraints, and single-cell      protein is an excellent alternative as it is nutritionally optimised to meet the demands of aquaculture. Our work in the REACT-FIRST project will determine its feasibility as a substitute for other protein sources in the feeds for farmed salmon.”

Polly Douglas, aquaculture innovation manager at
SAIC
, adds:
“REACT-FIRST is a highly innovative way of turning the CO
2
produced by another process into a key component of our food chain, providing a sustainable source of feed for fish. It could make a significant contribution to food security in the UK, while reducing the supply chain’s carbon footprint – both of which have seldom been of more relevance.”
The Synthetic Biology Research Centre (SBRC) at the University of Nottingham
is one of the largest research centres of its kind in the world, and is focused on engineering bacteria to make industrially useful products from single carbon feedstocks – in particular greenhouse gases, CO
2
and methane – with the overall goal to reduce reliance on petrochemicals by creating technologies that convert single carbon feedstocks into the chemicals, fuels and products society needs, including animal feed.
Of its role in REACT-FIRST, SBRC Director, Professor Nigel Minton, says:
“The SBRC has created a concentration of knowledge and expertise in aerobic gas fermentation for the UK. REACT-FIRST is a fantastic opportunity for the SBRC to work with like-minded organisations that share the passion to create sustainable routes to animal feed production systems. The project has the potential to make a real difference. REACT-FIRST’s joint industry: academia relationship is a conduit for the translation and adoption of UKRI-funded research. It is an important output of the SBRC’s research which will lead to significant outcomes from the SBRC’s research base, and we are delighted to provide SBRC’s unique facilities and expertise to support towards developing sustainable animal feed and in improving their nutritional characteristics.”
Experts from
Nottingham Trent University’s Poultry Research Unit
are tasked with investigating and benchmarking the nutritional quality of Proton™ as a poultry feed ingredient, advising on the processes to optimally prepare it for inclusion in the poultry feed, and conducting poultry nutrition trials. Once the nutritional evaluation is complete, NTU will work with the feed companies within the REACT-FIRST consortium to produce KPIs for improved protein ingredients profile based on commercial feed matrix data, which will be used to develop a report for the European Food Safety Authority to register the new feed materials.
Dr Emily Burton, Associate Professor in Sustainable Food Production at NTU, says:
“The poultry sector has much to be proud of in terms of low carbon meat production, but REACT-FIRST could catapult the sector into a completely new league. As well as providing access to a sustainable protein source, the project will help create stability for the animal production sector because feed represents about half of the total production costs for meat poultry.”
Along with providing the REACT-FIRST project with market-focused guidance throughout the lifecycle of the project,
Sainsbury’s
is assisting with stakeholder mapping and engagement in order to ensure maximum potential market acceptance, penetration and end-to-end value.
Sainsbury’s recently pledged to become Net Zero across its own operations by 2040, and REACT-FIRST’s focus aligns with these wider values, as Judith Batchelar, Director of Sainsbury’s Brand explains:
“Our customers care about where our products come from and they put their trust in us to do the right thing on their behalf. We’re proud to work closely with farmers, growers and suppliers in the UK and around the world to build resilient, sustainable and fairly-traded supply chains that will help more people live better today, tomorrow and in the future.
“Being part of the REACT-FIRST consortium is an outstanding opportunity to produce feeds for our farmed fish and chicken, with 65-75 percent smaller carbon footprints than existing feeds, no requirements for arable land, minimal water usage, and so we build more resilience into our supply chains for animal feed. REACT-FIRST should help the aquaculture and poultry feed industries move towards self-sufficiency from a dietary protein perspective, and reduce the instability of animal feed prices experienced by farmers.”
As well as assessing the economic, societal and environmental benefits of Proton
TM
, a team at
Innogen Institute at The University of Edinburgh
is supporting REACT-FIRST to innovate responsibly and engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure wider acceptance of the technology. The University’s REACT-FIRST work is being led by Alan Raybold and Joyce Tait who are both involved in research and teaching programmes in the University of Edinburgh’s
Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security
, an interdisciplinary hub committed to transforming global agri-food systems to achieve food and environmental security.
Alan Raybould, Chair of Innovation in the Life Sciences at the University, explains:
“REACT-FIRST is an exciting opportunity for Innogen to work with organisations throughout the animal-feed value chain to maximise the benefits of Proton
TM
and increase the sustainability of animal-protein production systems.”
Joyce Tait, Founding Director of Innogen and Technical Author of the British Standards Institution (BSI) standard for Responsible Innovation (
PAS440
), adds:
“Innogen’s experience in supporting responsible innovation from a business point of view means we are ideally placed to enable REACT-FIRST to deliver and demonstrate a responsible innovation approach for Proton
TM
production and commercialisation, including consumer acceptance.”
Geoff Simm
, Director of the Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security, adds:
“Sustainable protein feed sources will contribute to reducing the environmental impact of meat production systems. Projects like REACT-FIRST are key to help the industry move towards achieving net-zero emissions”.

About REACT-FIRST:
REACT-FIRST is led by Deep Branch, a carbon recycling biotechnology company. This project will obtain critical data about cost, digestibility, nutritional quality and carbon footprint of Proton™, a novel single-cell protein (SCP) produced by Deep Branch from CO
2
directly from industrial emissions.
REACT-FIRST encompasses all key stakeholders in the Proton™ production value chain. Using feed industry-defined data and advanced robotics, this project aims to further improve the strong nutritional profile of Proton™ and sustainably disrupt the UK’s aquaculture and poultry industries.
REACT-FIRST represents an end-to-end value-chain-wide consortium of industry and academic partners, with the collective aim to transform the UK’s food production system. The project will validate the techno-economics of the Deep Branch innovative CO
2
-to-protein process, establishing Deep Branch as a precision technology company at the base of a low carbon food value chain. The group is united in recognising that animal agriculture must change both to ensure food security and for the UK to reach its net-zero CO
2
target by 2050. By lowering the carbon footprint of animal feed, Proton™ can help to achieve this goal.
Currently, animal feed protein sources are imported from overseas, making the UK dependent on complicated and fragile supply chains. To address this problem, REACT-FIRST’s solution uses the technology developed by Deep Branch. Although this technology has huge transformative potential, commercialisation is not possible without cooperation with key stakeholders across the value chain – REACT-FIRST has been created to address this; it consists of groups of industrial and academic organisations, and even though relationships within these verticals are well established, this project represents the first time that the resources and expertise of all parties have been unified towards a single goal.

Drax begins ‘world-first’ power system stability contract with National Grid ESO
15 July 2020
Press releases

Drax Group’s Cruachan Power Station, a hydroelectric pumped storage plant in Scotland, has started to provide National Grid ESO with vital system support services as part of a six-year contract.
One of the power station’s generating units will provide support services such as inertia to keep power supplies secure without generating any electricity and enable more wind and solar power to come online.
Drax is the first of five providers to supply system support services to the grid in a move expected to save consumers more than £120m over the course of the contracts.
The new six-year partnership with National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), which is responsible for balancing supply and demand for electricity in Great Britain, is part of a world-leading approach to managing the decarbonisation of the grid – securing electricity supplies, saving consumers money and helping to enable more wind and solar power.
Cruachan Power Station has four generating units and under the terms of the contract awarded in January one of those will provide the grid with support services including inertia, which helps to keep the electricity system running at the right frequency to reduce the risk of power cuts.
It will achieve this through using a small amount of power from the grid to spin the turbine 600 times every minute offering inertia to the grid to manage changes in frequency without generating unneeded electricity.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group’s CEO, said:
“Drax is a leading provider of system support services in Great Britain. This new partnership underlines our commitment to enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
“Cruachan has played a critical role in the growth of renewables over the last decade and this new contract will enable more wind and solar power to come onto the grid in the years ahead.”

Inertia was traditionally a by-product of the kinetic energy in the spinning parts of large traditional power stations. As the country’s electricity system has transitioned from traditional sources of power like coal to renewables, such as wind and solar, there has been an increased need to separately procure inertia to maintain stable, secure supplies of power.
Through the stability tender the ESO has procured the equivalent amount of inertia as would have been provided by around five coal-fired power stations – and in the process will save consumers up to £128 million over six years.
Julian Leslie, ESO Head of Networks said:
“The GB electricity system is one of the most advanced in the world, both in terms of reliability and the levels of renewable power, and we’re really excited to be adding to that with this new approach to operating the grid.
“Our contracts for stability services with providers such as Drax are cheaper and greener, reducing emissions and saving money for electricity consumers.
“This approach – creating a market for inertia and other stability services – is the first of its kind anywhere in the world and is a huge step forward in our ambition to be able to operate the GB electricity system carbon free by 2025.”
Cruachan power station, in Argyll, is a unique pumped hydro storage plant located in the hollowed-out Ben Cruachan mountain. Using its reversible turbines, the station pumps water from Loch Awe to fill an upper reservoir on the mountainside at times when demand for electricity is low. This process allows the plant to act like a giant battery to store the water for when it is needed. When demand increases, the stored water can be released through the plant’s turbines to generate power quickly and reliably.
ENDS
Notes to editors
Inertia is a system support service which acts
like a shock absorber helping to control changes in frequency
, to ensure the grid maintains a frequency of 50Hz. Without having enough inertia available to reduce the rate of frequency changes which occur on the system, the grid is more vulnerable to power cuts.
You can read more about National Grid ESO’s innovative approach to securing stability services
on their website
.
As part of the stability tender the ESO has also secured contracts for system support services with Rassau Grid Services (Welsh Power), Statkraft, Triton and Uniper.

Two thirds of business leaders say they are more environmentally focussed following COVID-19 outbreak
13 July 2020
Press releases

Two thirds of business leaders (68%) claim the pandemic has made them more environmentally conscious
Three quarters (75%) feel they need to run their businesses differently with a renewed focus on flexibility
Over half (59%) say that the pandemic has increased the importance of sustainability, but the need to stabilise their business is holding them back
Our planet – Drax infographic [click to download]
Two thirds of Britain’s business leaders say they are now more environmentally conscious in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to new research released today.
The survey, jointly commissioned by B2B energy suppliers
Opus Energy
and
Haven Power
, part of Drax Group, found bosses are having to make bolder decisions as they prepare for a brave new business world. 66 percent admit that their own leadership requires a greater degree of bravery in decision making since the pandemic.
The news comes as the UK begins to move out of lockdown, and businesses begin to identify processes for the new world. Although over half (59%) say the pandemic has increased the importance of sustainability, the need to stabilise their business is holding them back from making bigger leaps in the sustainability agenda.
Three quarters (75%) of those questioned feel they need to run their businesses differently, with a focus on new ways of working, and almost half (48%) are looking to offer the option of working from home as they seek to provide employees with more flexibility.
Paul Sheffield, Managing Director of Drax’s Customer’s Businesses, said:
“Dealing with COVID-19 and the climate emergency is the greatest challenge the world has possibly ever faced. Business leaders recognise they need to be braver and more agile in their decision making to manage short-term priorities of stabilising their businesses and protecting employees. But they also realise that as we navigate out of lockdown, it’s more important than ever to make sure sustainability is at the heart of their operations.
“Drax is committed to enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. We are working with our customers as an energy partner, enabling them to become more sustainable, to reduce their emissions by using renewable electricity, EVs, batteries and smart technologies which are better for the environment but can also have a positive impact on their bottom line as well.”
Haven Power and Opus Energy are both specialist energy suppliers to businesses across the UK. As part of Drax Group, both brands are committed to delivering a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. By providing 100% renewable energy tariffs, developing end-to-end electric mobility solutions, and working with more than 2,300 small independent generators to provide customers with renewable energy, Drax is enabling the businesses it works with source and use their energy effectively, reducing costs and carbon emissions, whilst helping them to grow better businesses.

Power station ash paves the way for £1.5 billion road building project
7 July 2020
Press releases

Last month the £1.5 billion A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon scheme was completed six months ahead of schedule, providing improved links between the East of England, the Midlands and the North.
The ash from Drax Power Station, in North Yorkshire, was a key ingredient in the project’s concrete structures. Power Minerals Ltd (PML), which has a team based at the power station marketing the station’s ash stockpile, partnered with concrete firm Mick George to supply the road scheme.
“The success of the A14 scheme shows what the UK’s construction sector is capable of, when it works as one to achieve a common goal,”

said Nigel Waldron, Managing Director of PML.
“Our long-standing relationship with Drax and our partnership with Mick George was just one part of a collective industry-wide effort that has resulted in the A14 project coming in before time and on budget.
“Infrastructure projects can play a major part in restarting the UK’s economy post-Coronavirus, and this project, which was the biggest road building scheme in the UK, is a prime example of what can be achieved by industry working across the sectors.”
In February, Drax announced that it would stop using coal in March next year as part of its world-leading ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 by pioneering Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology. This means it will remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is produced across its operations. Over the last decade four of the power station’s six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass and now produce 12% of the UK’s renewable energy. This has transformed Drax to become the UK’s largest renewable power generator and is the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe.
The scheme includes a major new bypass to the south of Huntingdon and upgrades to 21 miles of the A14.
Mike Maudsley, Drax Group’s UK Portfolio Generation Director, said:
“Ending the use of coal at Drax next year will be a landmark moment in achieving our world-leading ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030.
“The use of our ash in this major construction project will leave a lasting legacy in the communities it has helped to connect across the A14 long-after coal generation comes to an end at the power station.”
Major construction and development projects that use PML’s ash in their concrete boast better ‘green’ credentials, as the cement manufacturing process uses significantly less energy. Using power station ash to make concrete also protects the environment, by removing the need to mine fresh aggregate from the countryside.
The £1.5 billion A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon scheme took four years to complete, upgrading 21 miles of road to transform journeys on the A14 in Cambridgeshire, shaving up to 20 minutes off journeys and strengthening links between the North, the Midlands and the East of England.
Work on the project began in November 2016. It employed more than 14,000 people in total, with up to 2,500 working on site during the project’s peak. Building the new road took 14 million construction hours – the equivalent of almost 1,600 years.

a year or more – a third of the UK’s target.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s ‘
Net Zero
’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO
2
– around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
Drax
launched the Zero Carbon Humber
campaign with Equinor and National Grid Ventures, aimed at creating the world’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in the region. As the world’s first negative emissions power station Drax could be the anchor for a net zero industrial cluster in the Humber region – protecting thousands of jobs, delivering clean growth and new export opportunities for the region.
