during the first quarter of 2023 outpacing gas which delivered 317 it is the firsttime wind has provided the largest share of power in any quarter in the history of the countrys electricity grid the findings have been released ahead of the next instalment of the quarterly drax electric insights report the publication is an independent report by academics from imperial college london commissioned through imperial consultants across the three months britains turbines generated 24 twh of electricity  enough to charge more than 300 million tesla model ys output from wind was 3 higher than during the same quarter last year while gas was down by 5 almost 42 of britains electricity came from renewable sources wind solar biomass and hydro in the first three months of 2023 fossil fuels supplied 33 with the rest coming from imports from abroad and the countrys shrinking nuclear fleet dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said the renewable power revolution has transformed how britain gets its electricity making our power grid cleaner and greener in the space of a decade the uk has almost completely cut out coal after relying on the most polluting fossil fuel for over a century to power our country there are still many hurdles to reaching a completely fossil fuelfree grid but wind out supplying gas for the first time is a genuine milestone event and shows what can be achieved when governments create a good environment for investors in clean technology britain has just one coalfired power station left following drax ending the use of the fuel at its plant in north yorkshire last month once the largest coalfired power station in western europe the plant is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the uk over the last decade four of the power stations six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass providing the uk with clean green and secure renewable electricity bruce heppenstall drax power station plant director said this is a remarkable achievement for the uk and it comes at a vital time when cutting the use of foreign gas is critical to our national energy security throughout the energy crisis biomass has also played a crucial role in providing the country with a reliable source of renewable power to displace fossil fuels from abroad at drax we believe the uk must now focus on unlocking investment in carbon negative technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which permanently remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit only beccs can simultaneously remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere whilst also generating reliable renewable power when the wind isnt blowing or the sun is not shining countries across the world and particularly the united states are stepping up to address climate change we believe the uk government should accelerate its policy support for beccs to give this country the best chance of establishing itself as a world leader in carbon removals attracting further clean energy investment creating jobs and delivering its net zero targets ends

singlelargest generator of renewable electricity drax power stations four biomass units generated 127twh of electricity in 2022 global renewable energy company drax has today announced the official end of coalfired generation at drax power station in north yorkshire marking a historic milestone in both the company and the uks transformation to a zerocarbon energy future following the discovery of the selby coalfield construction of the coalfired drax power station began nearby in 1967 the power station started generating power out of its first unit in 1974 and in 1975 following the completion of two additional generators the site officially opened at the time this provided enough power for around two million homes and in 1986 power generation capacity was doubled to just under 4gw once the largest coalfired power station in western europe the plant is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the uk over the last decade four of the power stations six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass providing the uk with clean green and secure renewable electricity following the end of the winter contingency agreement drax will now embark on a decommissioning process to remove coalrelated infrastructure from the site which will start with the flue gas desulphurisation plant that was built in the 1990s to remove 90 of the sulphur from the plants air emissions will gardiner drax group ceo said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark moment in our efforts to become a worldleading carbon negative company id like to thank the many hundreds of people including our staff suppliers and local communities for all the hard work it has taken to transform drax power station into the uks biggest renewable power source by output by converting the plant to use sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on but we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year and we are engaged in discussions with the uk government to move this 2bn project forward the global momentum for converting coalfired power stations to biomass is growing as more countries work to reduce their emissions by moving away from fossil fuels to renewables while maintaining their energy security in recent months new projects have been announced in countries from japan to hungary if beccs were eventually added to each of these sites they would be able to remove carbon from the atmosphere while generating power the uk government aims to deploy 5mt of engineered co2 removals per annum from beccs and other engineered ggr technologies by 2030 rising to 23mt in 2035 and up to 81mt in 2050 to keep the uk on a pathway to meet its legislated climate targets through transforming the plant to use sustainable biomass instead of coal drax has reduced its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 99 since 2012 ends media

coal  net zero family of tunnel tiger visit cruachan power station 14 april 2023 press releases eddie gallagher was one of the 4000 tunnel tigers who drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of mighty ben cruachan over a period of six years from 1959 to 1965 to make way for the uks first pumped storage hydro power station conditions for the men who worked at cruachan during were highly dangerous and eddie was among 15 men who tragically died during construction these men are commemorated by the mural on the wall of the machine hall as well as in a specially commissioned tartan drax created  which includes 15 strands of a special dark blue thread his family didnt know much about where he had worked and believed him to have been killed in a mine until a chance meeting with eddies longlost fiancée in 2019 which inspired the family to plan a visit to cruachan in may 2020 the trip was unfortunately postponed due to covid restrictions but on friday 17 th march this year eddie gallaghers family was finally able to make the trip to cruachan for a tour from the visitor centre team with some of the family travelling from as far as sydney director of draxs scottish assets ian kinnaird  met the family during their tour he said visits from families of those who were tragically killed during the construction at cruachan are a chance for us to learn more about these incredible men everyone involved has left a lasting legacy as part of the talented team who constructed this wonder of scottish engineering the team at cruachan visitor centre take great pride in telling these mens stories to our visitors everyone who visits has have complete admiration for their human endeavour that has led to cruachan still being operational nearly 60 years after opening after the visit eddies sisters each received a scarf made from the special tartan drax commissioned to commemorate the men who built cruachan ann buckley eddies niece  who organised the visit said i want to thank the team at cruachan so much for their help in organising this trip which was really emotional for our family we never knew where eddie worked and this has given us a whole new understanding the team showed so much patience and generosity towards us and great respect for my uncle and the other men who lost their lives we also appreciate that ian took the time to meet us and were grateful for the commemorative tartan we were presented with we will treasure it it means a lot that the company will not let our uncle be forgotten you can find out more about the men who built
