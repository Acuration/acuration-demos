reveals for the first time that national progress to power britains future economy and reduce carbon emissions is masking stark regional divides 19 november 2018 researchers from imperial college london and e4tech warn of a twotier economy emerging as britain goes through an energy revolution revolution taking place in uk energy system could unlock new growth lower energy bills and smarter living but many in society will lose out report reveals regional divides for the first time as communities and businesses in some areas power ahead while others risk being left behind london and scotland are pulling ahead while the north of england and east midlands lag furthest behind the research shows that businesses and families in london and scotland are better placed to take advantage of the benefits of the energy revolution including cheaper energy bills electric vehicles and smart appliances meanwhile the north of england and east midlands lag furthest behind conducted independently by researchers from imperial college london and e4tech facilitated by imperial consultants and commissioned by drax group the report breaks down the energy revolution into 20 metrics for the power transport and buildings sectors to provide a barometer of national and regional progress achievement against each of these metrics is scored as not on track within 90 of target or ahead of target commenting on his teams findings imperials dr iain staffell said the country is going through an energy revolution we are creating an energy system which will power our future economy and help tackle climate change but our research reveals that britain is at risk creating a twotier economy leaving millions of families and businesses less well equipped to enjoy cheaper bills and better health outcomes our concern is they will not be offered the same opportunities as people living in regions which are modernising their energy infrastructure responding to the findings will gardiner drax group ceo said great britain needs more secure clean energy to compete in the future economy there is an energy revolution underway which will deliver it  but this report uncovers worrying regional divides as we go through that transition drax is already working hard to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future for all we will work with all our partners including governments to ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution whos ahead and behind in the energy revolution differences in levels of government investment local policies and average household income have resulted in more affluent regions leading in the energy transition london leads progress jointly with scotland because its transport system is the countrys greenest as public transport walking and cycling are more dominant in london a londoners carbon footprint from transport is up to 25 times less than residents in other regions the capital also receives 45 of national funds for rail electrification resulting in the countrys lowest carbon emissions from rail it is also cheaper on average to own an electric car in london than in any other part of the country this is due to the average london driver travelling shorter distances and the exemption of electric vehicles ev from londons congestion charge scotland leads in the energy revolution with london due to its successful shift from fossil fuels to renewable generated electricity the number of ev charging points in scotland is also high compared to the number of vehicles despite the low population density the average scottish household is around 2km from a charging point but with the lifetime cost of running an ev being the highest in scotland and wales this is affecting uptake in these areas residential homes in leading regions london scotland and the east are also more energy efficient and more likely to score high ac energy performance certificate epc ratings and have fewer buildings rated f and g by comparison all of the regions lagging behind including wales yorkshire the east midlands and the north of england suffer from particularly low epc ratings the cost of heating combined with lower average incomes in these areas mean that fuel poverty rates are particularly high as the country transitions to more electric heating in future this is likely to result in increasing energy bills in these regions unless homes can be made more energy efficient or the cost of electric heating can be reduced particularly for vulnerable residents which sectors are ahead in the energy revolution the research also highlights sector differences while work to reduce the carbon impact of the power sector is on track due to the closure of coal stations and growth in renewables work to electrify heating improve the energy efficiency of homes and electrify the railway is falling behind ends media contacts jenny runnacles e email protected t 07747 561 760 rachel adeyinka e email protected t

through the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the metrics used to assess the state of transition in the energy system are presented as a barometer each barometer sets out three points the end target for the transformation for the target year in the scenario eg total number of ev charging points in 2030 the current state of transformation eg number of charging points operational and an indication of where we would have to be to meet the 2030 target eg number of charging points in 2018 the end target for transformation are based on 2030 targets from the national grid future energy scenarios fes the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis and the committee on climate change ccc the geographical scope refers to the 11 regions of great britain scotland wales and 9 in england northern ireland was excluded due to lack of available data the metrics examined by sector include the power system this section includes national and regional barometers for 1 carbon intensity of grid electricity 2 storage deployment 3 transmission capacity and 4 smart meter rollout a regional barometer is not presented for interconnection as this is a countrytocountry issue energy in transport this section includes national and regional barometers for 1 ghg emissions reductions 2 plugin vehicles in the car fleet 3 electric vehicle charging points 4 hydrogen refuelling stations 5 electric and hydrogen buses and 6 ultralow emission heavy goods vehicles hgvs a regional barometer is not represented for rail emissions this was examined across the entire british rail industry energy in buildings this section includes national and regional barometers for 1 energy efficiency by energy performance certificate epc ratings 2 electrification of heating and 3 heat pump deployment a regional barometer is not represented for fuel poverty as there were no milestones available for 2018 progress in the industrial sector is not examined due to a lack of data view the
