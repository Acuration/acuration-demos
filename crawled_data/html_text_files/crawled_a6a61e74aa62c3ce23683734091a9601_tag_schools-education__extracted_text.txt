schools and education bridging the skills gap to a net zero future starts with education 26 august 2022 sustainable business jane breach community and education lead for drax power station key takeaways decarbonising the humber industrial cluster could create as many as 50000 new jobs  requiring a workforce skilled in the low carbon technologies draxs engagement with local education establishments is important to us as a good neighbour to communities and in bridging the emerging skills gap weve worked closely with nearby selby college to create a syllabus that will equip both current and future drax employees with skills for low carbon technologies including handson carbon capture usage and storage engineering across the uk decarbonising businesses must identify what skills their future employees will need and work with educators to deliver curriculums at drax we have a longlasting commitment to promoting science technology engineering and maths stem education in the yorkshire and humber region and beyond delivering the zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster initiatives means that we will need a highly skilled labour force to help us reach the regions goal of building the worlds first net zero industrial region  in practice this will create roughly 50000 new jobs in the region  requiring a workforce who are proficient in new and emerging low carbon technologies businesses in education we have a responsibility to be a good neighbour support education in our local area to help secure our talent pipeline and provide inspiration bruce heppenstall drax plant director lewis marron drax 4th year apprentice and liz ridley deputy principal at selby college one way were helping to develop the next generation of green economy colleagues is through our partnership with nearby selby college in 2020 we announced a 180000 fiveyear partnership with the college aimed at supporting education and skills last year we expanded our partnership even further and developed the uks first educational programmes dedicated to carbon capture working together we secured more than 270000 in funding from the government for the programme enabling the college to create a new training course in carbon capture usage and storage ccus technologies our engineers work closely with the college developing a syllabus that will equip both current and future drax employees with the vital skills needed to operate negative emissions technology this even includes a rig that mirrors the ccus equipment used in our bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot giving students the chance to work with real equipment rather than just the theory we believe that by showing students the kind of work we do onsite we can give them a deeper understanding of how we operate the department of education highlighted the success of our partnership as an example of how business and education can work together  something i believe is crucial to bridging the emerging low carbon skills gap the skills gap and future stem workers our work with selby college has highlighted the significant need to educate and upskill the uks workforce in low carbon technologies as quickly as possible although most organisations recognise the need to decarbonise they are uncertain about what they and their employees need to do to achieve this there are a lot of conversations about the need for green skills and reskilling employees in carbonintensive sectors but to put a real definition on whats needed is a lot harder every company must examine its business plan and try to unpick what skills they will need in 10 20 or even 50 years down the line  and in such a fast moving world this can prove to be a real challenge at drax were committed to building on our values  as an innovative and best in class place where we care about what matters we aim to do this by identifying training needs that are linked with new technologies beyond just beccs and working together with educators to make sure the relevant courses can either be distributed to other smes and large companies or adapted to help retrain people in other sectors our commitment to stem and education starts with young people and a handson curriculum delivered by our engineers to help support teachers we want to develop deeper more impactful education programmes that offer them multiple interactions with drax our engineers and operations throughout a persons education in my role you dont always see the immediate impact however when you start talking to people you realise that youve impacted them at some stage on their career journey that impact is whats really important to us and to building a net zero humber find more information about our partnership with selby

careers  schools and education in a crisis people come first will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 14 may 2020 opinion this crisis will be remembered for many things many are not positive but some are inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business
