cruachan power station visit drax power station getting more from less there are few places in a power station as integral to generating electricity as the turbines making sure they run efficiently at drax is down to luke varley and his team 22 january 2017 power generation what can we do to ensure plant integrity increase plant efficiency and ultimately get more megawatts out of the door for less this is a question at the heart of luke varleys work varley is the lead engineer in the turbine section at drax power station  a team who look after arguably the heart of the plant the steam turbines that drive electricity generation as well as managing daytoday maintenance he and a team of engineers and craftspeople within tsg deliver the major overhaul activities on the turbines to keep them running efficiently and safely but as the uks largest power station its a site that needs to run all the time  any maintenance needs to fit around that consistent operation for the most part this happens in the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the station can be temporarily shut down to carry out repairs even though varley recognises theres a large cost involved in shutting part of the plant down it leads to longer term gains were taking on work to improve efficiency because the end result is were using less fuel to get more electricity he says a small percentage increase in biomass efficiency can represent huge cost savings he adds but as a relatively new fuel biomass  in draxs case compressed wood pellets  presents a unique challenge for the engineers working with it the biomass challenge in the days when drax ran only on coal at full load as part of a stable national grid turbine maintenance meant facing common problems where we had problems which were familiar from one hundred years of turbine history  we knew what to look for varley explains but now the plant generates within a far more demanding network that needs flexibility and produces more than half its power using compressed wood pellets theres a need for greater efficiency  it means more innovative thinking and new challenges for example most plants in the industry take each turbine offline to maintain it every eighttoten years but using wood pellets means the turbines need to be as efficient as possible and this means more regular inspections every four years we go back overhaul the module and maximise its efficiency again thats new to the industry within the uk nobody else is doing that he says despite the challenges varley isnt fazed the technical and management challenges they both come with experience he explains his engineering experience began before his start at drax as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game destined for grease my dads been in engineering all his life hed be building a car and id be dragged to a scrap man to help take an engine block out of an old car so he could use it at home varley says i was destined to always be covered in grease so when it came to beginning his career varley was set on what path he wanted to take two options presented themselves working as a trainee draftsman in an air conditioning company or taking an apprenticeship with national power an early visit to drax helped make his decision even though id been around engineering with my dad as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game he took the apprenticeship which led him to a number of power plants but the impression of the drax turbine hall never left him later in my career i spent a lot of my time going around different power stations and in grandness and scale ive never come across anything that matches what weve got at drax so when this job came about and i was asked to join i said sounds good to me today his position of getting more megawatts out of the door for less whilst ensuring safe operation of the plant is one that comes with a lot of responsibility and is built on a long history the guy who was doing this job before me took a lot of pride in it he used to say ive been here man and boy i was even here when it was built and i wouldnt have retired until i knew it was in safe hands varley says i suppose thats the best recognition i could get really share name email comment sign
