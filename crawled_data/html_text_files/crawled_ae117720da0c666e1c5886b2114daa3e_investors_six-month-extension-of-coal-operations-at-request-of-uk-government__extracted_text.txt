power station sixmonth extension of coal operations at request of uk government 6 july 2022 investors rns number  5919r drax group plc drax or the group symboldrx in response to increased pressure on european gas markets and associated concerns about electricity security of supply in the uk this winter the uk government has asked owners of legacy coalfired generation assets including drax to work together with national grid to temporarily extend the life of their coal generation assets to march 2023 at the request of the uk government drax has now entered into an agreement with national grid  in its capacity as the electricity systems operator  pursuant to which its two coalfired units at drax power station will remain available to provide a winter contingency service to the uk power system from october 2022 until the end of march 2023 the units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and only operate if and when instructed to do so by national grid under the terms of the agreement drax will be paid a fee for the service and compensated for costs incurred including coal costs in connection with the operation of the coal units in accordance with the agreement will gardiner draxs group ceo said at the request of the uk government drax has agreed to delay the planned closure of its two coalfired units and help bolster the uks energy security this winter drax has played a central role in ensuring britains energy security over several decades and our workforce is proud to be providing this critical support to the uk energy system drax is the uks largest generator of renewable power producing enough reliable renewable electricity for 5 million households from our sustainable biomass and hydro operations and we remain committed to delivering a coalfree future the uks longterm energy security depends on investment in innovative green technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which provides reliable renewable power whilst permanently removing co 2 from the atmosphere drax aims to invest billions of pounds developing beccs in the uk by 2030 provided that the uk government has in place policies to support the feasibility and delivery of negative emissions technologies which it has committed to developing this year drax ended commercial operations on its tworemaining coalfired generation units in march 2021 and formal closure was planned for september 2022 following the fulfilment of the groups capacity market obligations on these units a limited sixmonth extension to march 2023 is not expected to result in a material level of coal generation 1  throughout 2021 coalfired generation accounted for 3 of the groups generation output and in the first three months of 2022 this was less than 1 with the balance from renewables  sustainable biomass pumped storage and hydro the decision to end coal generation supports the groups purpose of enabling a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and the transition to a flexible renewable generation model this has led to a more than 95 reduction in the groups scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions since 2012 and enabled drax to become the uks largest source of renewable electricity by output investment in renewables to date drax has invested over 2 billion in renewables and uk security of supply with options for a further 3 billionto be invested this decade subject to the right investment environment these investment options include the development of negative emissions technologies and pumped storage which the uk government has said are necessary to decarbonise the electricity generation sector by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050 no expected impact on beccs drax continues to expect to take a final investment decision on its drax power station beccs project in 2024 subject to the right investment environment and in 2022 is investing incrementally in the development of this option this includes the removal of certain coal infrastructure a sixmonth extension of coal is not expected to impact on the timing of a final investment decision or intended commissioning date for the project site preparation works for beccs are ongoing and will accelerate following formal closure of the coal units in march 2023 the uk government recognises the important role which beccs has to play in delivering net zero requiring at least 5mt of co 2 per year from beccs and other engineered greenhouse gas removals ggr by 2030 to support this ambition in july 2022 the uk government published a consultation on engineered ggrs separately in order to develop the financial model required to support beccs  and reflective of its advanced technological readiness and the cobenefits of both power and negative emissions  the uk government is expected to publish a power beccs business model consultation during summer 2022 the group believes that negative emissions and beccs represent a trilliondollar global market opportunity and is separately continuing to develop options to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 notes  1 drax will work with national grid to source up to approximately 400000 tonnes of additional coal which together with current stocks is enough for c1twh of electricity generation to deliver the service and will only operate if and when instructed to
