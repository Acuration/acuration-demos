Press Release
Britain sending Europe power lifeline – report
30 September 2022
Press releases

Britain exported more power to Europe than ever before in the second quarter of the year, making it a net exporter of electricity for the first time in over a decade, according to a new report.
The new trade surplus with Europe was worth around £1.5 billion for the UK economy during the period.
The energy crisis in Europe may have shone a light on an opportunity for Britain to become ‘Europe’s power battery’ by investing in long duration electricity storage technologies.
For the first time in over a decade, Britain became a net exporter of electricity to its European neighbours, making around £1.5bn for the economy in three months.
An independent report by academics from Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights, commissioned via Imperial Consultants, shows that in the three months to June 2022, 8% (5.5TWh) of the electricity generated by Britain was exported abroad – the largest amount on record.
Whilst Russia throttled gas supplies and France suffered severe reliability problems with its nuclear power stations, Britain developed a trade surplus in electricity with the rest of Europe.
The excess was exported abroad through subsea cables known as interconnectors.
Share of British electricity that was imported and exported each quarter.

The report’s authors estimate the trade surplus was worth around £1.5 billion for the UK economy during the three months to June.
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Electric Insights report, said:
“Britain has played an important role in helping to keep the lights on across Europe amid the deepening energy crisis which is being weaponised by Russia against our nearest neighbours.
“With Europe now facing long-term security of supply problems, there could be an economic argument for Britain to step up investment in power production in the years ahead to build an even bigger trade surplus, and protect our nation from damaging energy shortages.”
Another country highlighted by the report to have exported more power than usual to the continent was Norway, with its vast hydro reservoirs being drained to their lowest levels since 1996. Even Britain was a net importer of power from the Scandinavian state over the period, using the country’s enormous hydro storage capacity to balance out drops in supply from intermittent sources of electricity such as wind and solar farms.
The Electric Insights report states there could be “value in increasing the amount of pumped hydro energy storage in the UK” to balance shortfalls in supply from renewables, rather than relying on Norwegian imports. The UK has just under 3GW of pumped storage hydro capacity, less than half of the capacity of comparable countries like Germany.
While the need for the UK to have greater long duration energy storage capacity is growing, barriers to securing private investment in these projects means it has been almost 40 years since a new pumped storage hydro power station was built here.
There are
growing calls
from the energy industry for the government to introduce measures to support the roll-out of a new generation of long duration storage plants.
Drax is progressing plans to build a new 600 MW underground pumped storage hydro facility at its existing Cruachan site in Scotland.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said:
“Britain desperately needs a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants to strengthen its own energy security, but it is clear the rest of Europe would benefit as well.
“We have the opportunity to become Europe’s power battery, helping our friends and neighbours reduce their dependence on energy from Russia whilst enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to power UK homes and businesses. It’s an opportunity which Britain should take, or risk being left behind by other countries.”

A copy of the Drax Electric Insights Q2 2022 report is available by
clicking here
.
The report found Britain had a trade surplus of 5% of electricity generated (8% exported minus 3% imported), with a net value of £500m per month.
Historically, Britain has been an importer of electricity, with an average of 8% of electricity coming from our neighbours over the last decade.
In May, Drax applied for consent to
build a new 600MW pumped storage hydro plant
at its existing Cruachan facility in Argyll, Scotland.
The new power station could be operation in 2030 with construction work getting underway in 2024.
No investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework with the UK government.
Last month, Switzerland opened
Europe’s latest pumped storage hydro plant
under the Alps. The plant has the same storage capacity as 400,000 electric vehicle batteries.

‘Renewable energy apprentices’ kickstart careers at Cruachan Power Station
Press releases

The apprentices have won places on apprenticeship schemes at Cruachan Power Station near Oban – the underground pumped hydro storage power station built in a hollowed-out cavern 1km inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll’s highest mountain.
The four-year programme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain expertise working alongside highly skilled engineers at the iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ facility, which plays a critical role in supporting Scotland’s power system.
Drax’s Scottish Assets & Generation Engineering Director Ian Kinnaird said: “Providing these young people with the tools needed to become the skilled workforce of the future is not only essential to the success of our business, it’s also an incredibly rewarding part of what we do.
“Giving our apprentices the opportunity to work on renewable energy technology will ensure we’re nurturing our in-house talent and creating opportunities for people here in Scotland to lead the green energy revolution needed to get the UK to net zero.”
Marcus Lane, aged 18
Marcus Lane, aged 18 from Oban, who has joined Drax as a craftsperson apprentice, said: “I applied for an apprenticeship at Drax because I’ve always been interested in a career in engineering, and then after doing a week’s work experience with Drax it confirmed that this is what I want to do. I also knew that getting an apprenticeship with Drax would mean I’d receive great training to further my knowledge of renewable energy and increase the opportunities available to me in the future. I’m looking forward to working on such a wide variety of machinery and seeing exactly how the power station works.”
Marcus will start work on-site at Cruachan once he has completed formal training at the East Kilbride Group Training Association.
Iain Livingstone, aged 29 from Dalmally, is studying for a graduate apprenticeship in Design and Manufacturing and will attend Glasgow Caledonian University one day a week alongside his work at the power station.
Iain said: “Previously I worked in Marine Engineering in the oil and gas industry and thought that a graduate apprenticeship like this one would be a perfect transition from that industry into the renewable energy sector. This apprenticeship will also allow me to build on the knowledge and skills I’ve already gained and to further develop my academic qualifications. During the application process, I researched Drax and found that their goals and values aligned with my own and I’m looking forward to being a part of the company’s future.”
Drax recently
submitted the planning application
to build a new underground pumped hydro storage power station at Cruachan which will more than double the site’s electricity generating capacity.
The new 600-megawatt (MW) power station will be located inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll’s highest mountain – and increase the site’s total capacity to 1 gigawatt (GW).

New research outlines Drax’s contribution to the North’s economy
23 September 2022
Press releases

Oxford Economics analysis shows that in 2021 Drax Group contributed £749 million towards the North of England’s economy and supported 5,720 jobs.
The Group’s ambitious plans for growth will see it invest a further £3bn into the UK by 2030, creating tens of thousands of jobs from as soon as 2024.
Independent analysis by Oxford Economics has shown that last year renewable energy leader Drax contributed £749 million towards the North of England’s economy and supported 5,720 jobs across the UK.
The analysis measured the economic impact of Drax Group’s UK operations, which includes Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire – the country’s biggest renewable power generator, which produces enough renewable electricity for four million homes.
The figures come as Drax continues to progress its plans to deliver a green jobs boom in the UK in the years ahead by becoming a world leader in negative emissions technology BECCS and investing billions of pounds in renewable energy projects.
Drax plans to invest £2.5bn in its green energy projects in the UK this decade, supporting security of supply and the UK’s net zero ambitions. The plans include building the world’s largest carbon capture in power project at its North Yorkshire plant.
BECCS is the only technology which permanently removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere whilst also generating the reliable renewable electricity the world needs to deliver secure supplies of energy and enable it to move away from fossil fuels.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Plant Director, said:
“Not only is Drax playing a critical role in keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses across the country, but we are also proud to be supporting thousands of jobs in the UK and contributing millions of pounds to the economy at a time when it is under severe pressure.
“With the right support from government, Drax stands ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in developing BECCS so we can do even more for our communities and the climate. Not only will this projects permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but it will also support tens of thousands of jobs during construction, and bolster UK energy security.”
Stephen Foreman, Associate Director at Oxford Economics, said:
“Our research demonstrates the significant contribution that a large and successful British company like Drax Group can make to the global economy. Drax Group’s operations in the U.K., U.S., and Canada generated £3.1 billion in GDP in 2021 and supported over 35,000 jobs across these three markets.
“We also find that the activity generated by Drax’s power stations, pellet plants, and corporate offices, is also having a positive impact on local communities across the U.K., the U.S. and Canada.”
Drax aims to source 80% of the services and materials for BECCS from British businesses, and it recently signed an agreement with British Steel to explore opportunities to source steel for the construction from the firm’s Scunthorpe and Teesside plants.
Thousands of jobs could start being created at Drax in just a couple of years’ time, with work to deploy BECCS at Drax Power Station set to get underway as soon as 2024, with around 10,000 jobs being created and supported during the project’s peak.

About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
Drax’s around 3,000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties. For more information visit
www.drax.com
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in England and Scotland. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is also where Drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology BECCS within its CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) Incubation Area.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.
The Group also aims to build on its BECCS innovation at Drax Power Station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative CO2 emissions each year from new-build BECCS outside of the UK by 2030 and is currently developing models for North American and European markets.
Pellet production and supply:
The Group has 18 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year.
Drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030, which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity. The pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in Europe and Asia for the generation of renewable power.
Drax’s pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in North Yorkshire, England to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses, and also to customers in Europe and Asia.
Customers:
Drax supplies renewable electricity to UK businesses, offering a range of energy-related services including energy optimisation, as well as electric vehicle strategy and management.

New research outlines Drax’s contribution to the Scottish economy
Press releases

Oxford Economics analysis shows that in 2021 Drax Group contributed £133 million towards the Scottish economy and supported 1,250 jobs.
The Group’s ambitious plans for growth will see it invest a further £3bn into the UK by 2030, creating tens of thousands of jobs from as soon as 2024.
Independent analysis by Oxford Economics has shown that last year renewable energy leader Drax contributed £133 million towards the Scottish economy and supported 1,250 jobs across the country.
The analysis measured the economic impact of Drax Group’s UK operations in 2021, which includes the iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station, near Oban in Argyll – an underground pumped hydro storage plant which acts like a giant water battery to balance the country’s power grid.
The figures come as Drax continues to progress its plans to deliver a green jobs boom in the UK in the years ahead by becoming a world leader in negative emissions technology BECCS and investing billions of pounds in renewable energy projects.
Drax plans to invest £2.5bn in its green energy projects in the UK this decade, supporting security of supply and the UK’s net zero ambitions. The plans include building the first new pumped storage hydro power station in the UK in more than 40 years at its existing Cruachan site.
Thousands of jobs could start being created by these projects in just a couple of years’ time, with work on Cruachan 2 potentially starting as soon as 2024. Around 900 jobs would be supported during six years of construction across the supply chain in a range of industries from quarrying and engineering, to transport and hospitality.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish assets director, said:
“Not only is Drax playing a critical role in keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses across the country, but we are also proud to be supporting more than a thousand jobs in Scotland and contributing millions of pounds to the economy at a time when it is under severe pressure.

“With the right support from government, Drax stands ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in developing Cruachan 2 so we can do even more for our communities and the climate. Not only will extending Cruachan enable more wind power to come online, but it will also support hundreds of jobs during construction and bolster UK energy security.”
Stephen Foreman, Associate Director at Oxford Economics, said:
“Our research demonstrates the significant contribution that a large and successful British company like Drax Group can make to the global economy.
“Drax Group’s operations in the U.K., U.S., and Canada generated £3.1 billion in GDP in 2021 and supported over 35,000 jobs across these three markets. We also find that the activity generated by Drax’s power stations, pellet plants, and corporate offices, is also having a positive impact on local communities across the U.K., the U.S. and Canada.”
Jobs supported by Drax’s activities across the UK covered a wide range of sectors including high-skilled manufacturing of industrial components, engineering and technical machinery, IT, professional business services and transporting goods.
