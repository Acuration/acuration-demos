the vision who we are east coast cluster news resources contact us zero carbon humber roadmap published to protect jobs and make major contribution to uks climate goals 05112019 capture for growth a roadmap for the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster sets out how the region could deliver the governments worldleading ambition to establish the first net zero carbon industrial cluster in the uk by 2040 new ambitious proposals published to create worlds first netzero carbon industrial cluster by 2040 in the humber region the roadmap would help protect 55000 industrial jobs by helping firms decarbonise saving 275bn in carbon taxes by 2040 the region could make a bigger contribution to uks climate goals than any other industrial cluster  capturing 15 of the uks current annual co 2 emissions all parties urged to adopt roadmap in manifestos for government a new report providing the most detailed assessment yet of how the uk can develop the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster has been published the proposals published by the zero carbon humber campaign led by multinational energy firms drax group equinor and national grid ventures could help protect 55000 jobs and deliver the biggest contribution to the uks climate goals of any industrial region capture for growth a roadmap for the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster sets out how the region could deliver the governments worldleading ambition to establish the first net zero carbon industrial cluster in the uk by 2040 helping the humber to compete on the world stage by attracting new investment industries and employment the proposals are supported by new analysis by element energy which finds that if the worlds first net zero carbon industrial cluster is developed in the humber region 53 million tonnes of co 2 a year could be captured  thats around 15 of the uks current annual co 2 emissions they would also help save industrial businesses in the region carbon taxes of up to 275bn by 2040 helping to protect jobs and competitiveness lord haskins chair of the humber local enterprise partnership which is supporting the zero carbon humber campaign said i welcome these proposals which set out a clear route to protect jobs tackle climate change and help the humber compete globally today the uk is in the lead but other countries are closing the gap by helping their industries achieve their net zero carbon goals the humber is uniquely well placed to deliver clean growth and i hope the next government will get behind the exciting proposals coming forward from the region will gardiner ceo of drax group commented the race to cut carbon emissions is one we can win this plan sets out a clear blueprint of how to get the humber to net zero  the impact of decarbonising the most carbon intensive region in the country will make a major contribution to the uk reaching its worldleading climate goals we need to seize this opportunity zero starts here caption idattachment_670

economy can be kickstarted from the humber region and grow across the north of england hydrogen has a key role to play in the uk reaching net zero by cleaning up industry heating transport and power as well as delivering improved air quality jon butterworth coo global transmission at national grid ventures said the government has set out ambitious plans to develop the worlds first zero carbon industry cluster by 2040 we believe this is a challenge that can and should be met by working together across industry sectors we can protect uk jobs drive further economic growth and help the country achieve critically important climate goals that will significantly benefit current and future generations the uk is among the top five nations in the race to decarbonise industry by using carbon capture and storage ccs but risks falling behind as other countries move to deploy ccs at scale caption idattachment_666 alignaligncenter width1024 click to viewdownload infographiccaption the report shows that the humber is ideally positioned to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster the region is home to the uks biggest industrial economy employing 55000 people and contributing 18bn to uk gdp each year it has a rich industrial heritage and hosts around 100 chemical and refining companies alone which together account for around 12 of total employment in the uk chemicals sector the humber is also the uks largest emitter of co 2  industries could face carbon taxes of up to 275bn by 2040 which would harm competitiveness a world leading trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs technology is underway at draxs power plant in north yorkshire which could create the worlds first negative emissions power station this power station could then be used as the economic anchor to make a carbon capture pipeline across the humber viable  enabling industrial businesses in the region to capture the carbon they emit a new hydrogen production facility could kick start a hydrogen economy in the region covering industry heating for homes and businesses power generation and transport cleaner transport alone could remove 42 million tonnes of co 2 from the region improve air quality and save the nhs millions of pounds the committee on climate change ccc said earlier this year that deploying carbon capture and hydrogen technologies at scale is essential if the uk is to meet its legally binding target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 the humber is also close to potential major geological storage sites for co 2 emissions deep beneath the southern north sea the publication of capture for growth a roadmap for the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster follows the recent launch of a government consultation into its 315m industrial energy transition fund which is intended to help industry reduce carbon emissions caption idattachment_667 alignaligncenter width2550 click to viewdownload infographiccaption ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of

editors in may drax group national grid ventures and equinor announced they had signed a memorandum of understanding committing them to work together to explore how a largescale carbon capture usage and storage ccus network and a hydrogen production facility could be constructed in the humber in the mid2020s the zero carbon humber vision includes developing a hydrogen demonstrator and test facility in the humber installing carbon capture technology at drax power station to create the worlds first carbon negative power station building a carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage system across the region that industry can connect to safely storing carbon deep under the seabed in the southern north sea unlocking a cuttingedge hydrogen economy  providing a low carbon fuel to decarbonise industry power heat transport and maritime across the north of england creating the conditions for new industries which use the ccus pipeline or low carbon hydrogen to develop in the region  creating new jobs and opportunities locally and across the country the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero the cccs net zero report also identified that at least one of the uks ccus regional clusters should involve substantial production of lowcarbon hydrogen by 2030 to stay on track for net zero it also recommends that infrastructure development for ccus should start as early as possible in all regional clusters with large industrial emissions the recently published h21 north of england study has also shown that up to 37 million homes as well as other industrial processes could be converted from natural gas to hydrogen to meet the uks climate change targets the estimate for carbon taxation receipts facing humber industrials in 2040 is based on the low and high scenarios for carbon pricing forecast in the hm treasury green book 2018 the uks committee on climate change ccc estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1 of forecasted gdp per annum in 2050 however the business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee inquiry found that failure to deploy ccus and beccs technology could double the cost to 2
