power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station is there such a thing as energy terroir the regions making the most of their natural environment to produce electricity 16 april 2019 power generation terroir comes from the french word terre meaning land earth or soil in the french wine industry it refers to the land from which grapes are grown it is believed the terroir gives the grapes a unique quality specific to that particular growing site terroir dictates the type of wine that comes from a region  its the reason we call one bottle a bordeaux and another a côtes du rhone but could the idea of terroir hold relevance beyond just wine what if we looked at electricity in the same way certain environments are better placed to produce certain types of electricity these are some of the regions making the most of their unique location and landscape to produce electricity that makes sense for them la rance tidal barrage brittany france brittany boasts one third of mainland frances coasts and has long been a top destination for surfers with waves as high as 76 metres in some places with such tempestuous waters its the perfect location for la rance tidal power station  the worlds first station of its kind opened in 1966 the site was chosen because it has the highest tidal range in france tidal barrages like la rance harness the potential energy in the difference in height between low and high tides the barrage creates an artificial reservoir to enable different water levels which then drives turbines and generators to produce electricity while the station has been operating for close to 50 years old tidal mills are still dotted around the rance river some dating back to the 15 th century  proof that tidal power has deep roots in this region xinjiang china whilst china may have some of the worlds most polluted cities it is also the worlds biggest producer of renewable energy  including wind power with one of the largest land masses on the planet one in every three of the worlds wind turbines is in china with the government installing one per hour in 2016 in places like xinjiang  chinas most westerly province the windy weather used to be a nuisance with overturned lorries and derailed trains being a regular sight this is caused by mountain ranges between dabancheng and ürümqi which form a natural wind tunnel increasing the wind speed as air passes through these days the region is harnessing this same wind to produce incredible amounts of electricity  with 278 terwatt hours twh of electricity coming from the region in the first nine months of 2018 onshore wind farm in xinjiang xinjiang local wu gang founded goldwind to build chinas first windfarm here in the 1980s today its the worlds second largest turbine maker the turbines work on a simple premise wind turns the turbine blades which are connected to a rotor causing it to spin this in turn is connected to a generator which takes the winds kinetic energy to produce electricity hengill iceland iceland sits where the north american and eurasian tectonic plates meet meaning that magma rises close to the surface bringing with it a lot of energy potential one example of how the icelandic people are harnessing this power is the hellisheiði  the second largest geothermal power station in the world here highpressure geothermal steam is extracted from 30 wells ranging from 2000 to 3000 metres deep and is used to turn turbines and generate electricity this renewable plant has a capacity of 303 megawatts mw of electricity which is used to power the capital city of reykjavik the site was chosen due to its location in the hengill volcanic area in the south of iceland one of the most active geothermal areas on the planet here a giant magma chamber sits underground with thousands of hot springs above according to icelands national energy authority geothermal power from sites like this accounts for 25 of the countrys electricity production and 66 of primary energy usage but icelanders arent only using the geothermal landscape for energy production  chefs here can cook food simply by burying it in the ground producing delicacies like rúgbrauð  which translates as hot spring bread ouarzazate morocco from icelands belowzero temperatures to morocco a popular holiday destination for sunseekers with 330 days of sunshine a year morocco lays claim to a chunk of the sahara desert famously known as one of the hottest climates in the world where better then to situate the worlds largest solar thermal power plant noor solar thermal plant the moroccan city of ouarzazate nicknamed the  door of the desert plays host to the huge noor complex  which is still under construction and is being implemented in four parts the latest piece of the puzzle is noor iii which was hooked up to moroccos electricity grid last year  here 7400 mirrors reflect sun rays onto noor iiis tower the highest solarthermal tower in the world concentrating at the top of the building to create around 500ºc of heat this heats up the molten salts inside the tower which travel through a series of pipes creating high pressure steam this steam then moves a turbine to generate electricity molten salts are used at noor iii because they can operate at high temperatures and store heat effectively so that the site can continue to produce energy for up to 75 hours when theres no sun once up and running the plant will generate enough energy to power 120000 homes with no atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  along with the other projects at the noor complex noor iii is helping morocco to achieve its goal of obtaining 42 of its power from renewable sources by 2020 ben cruachan scotland the sun rays that shine on the noor complex are few and far between in the highlands but there are mountains aplenty  ben cruachan being one of them ben cruachan is the highest point in the argyll and bute area of scotland and is right next to the picturesque loch awe this provides the backdrop for the worlds first high head reversible pumpedstorage hydro scheme built by british engineer edward mccoll over 50 years ago cruachan power stations reservoir and loch awe viewed from the top of ben cruachan with the help of a 4000strong army of workers nicknamed the tunnel tigers  mccoll turned the slopes of ben cruachan into a geological battery which great britain still relies on today it works by using excess electricity on the national grid to pump water from loch awe at the foot of the mountain up to the cruachan reservoir 300 metres above during times of heightened demand  like when everyone puts the kettle on during a coronation street ad break or when the wind speed suddenly drops around breakfast time  this water is released back down the mountain to turn the turbines that live inside the hollowed mountain in this way cruachan power station can meet the nations energy needs within seconds whereas gas or nuclear stations would take many tens of minutes or hours to reach such capacity while ben cruachan lends itself perfectly to this pumpedstorage hydro facility it is only one of four such sites in the uk the challenge in installing more is that there are only a few sites which are mountainous with suitably large bodies of water nearby  things that are inherently necessary for pumpedstorage hydroelectricity  the growing importance of terroir all of these places embrace the land around them to produce energy in inventive ways and as levels of decarbonisation grow around the world there are an increasing number of places using whats available close to home for energy solutions take barbados  a country that has traditionally relied on imported fossil fuels for 96 of its electricity  but with short driving distances and 220 days of pure sunlight every year the government has seen the potential for electric vehicles run by solar power with modular solar carports now a regular sight in barbados the island has become one of the worlds top users of evs  preserving the picturesque landscape and reducing its dependence on imported petrol solar panels above an office car park in barbados meanwhile palau a small pacific island nation is building the worlds largest microgrid  consisting of 35 mw of solar panels and 45 mwh of energy storage for a nation threatened by rising sea levels making use of its geographic features allows it to work towards its 70 renewable energy target by 2050 and reduce its reliance on imports as more countries continue to move away from fossil fuels taking advantage of their unique terroir will increasingly enable them to produce electricity that works with their landscape share related stories press releases offshore wind shortfall risks higher power prices and
