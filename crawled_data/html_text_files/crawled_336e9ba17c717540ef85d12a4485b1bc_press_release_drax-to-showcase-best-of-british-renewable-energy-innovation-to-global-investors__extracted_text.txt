negative emissions technology that will enable us to become the largest carbon capture in power project in the world by leading on the development and introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs the uk can kickstart a new global industry delivering tens of thousands of jobs and supporting a new green economy drax stands ready to invest in this vital technology  work to build beccs at drax could get underway as soon as 2024 delivering for the uk economy and the climate minister for investment gerry grimstone said the global investment summit will put uk innovation on the map and demonstrate how we can use investment to nurture technological developments and propel our economy towards a more prosperous exciting future our showcase businesses shows why the uk is a global hub for green technology and i am proud that drax will be presenting their innovative bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology to some of the worlds most highprofile investors at the summit our industries of the future like renewable energy will not only help ensure a cleaner greener planet but also create high value jobs in yorkshire and across the uk as well as deploying beccs at drax the renewable energy company is also exploring opportunities to deploy this vital negative emissions technology internationally demonstrating climate leadership ahead of cop26 in glasgow ends media contacts ben wicks media manager e email protected t 07761 525 662 editors notes drax will be showcasing its innovative negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at the global investment summit beccs at drax power station will deliver at least 8m tonnes of negative emissions a year  equivalent to 15 of the negative emissions the ccc says are required from beccs in 2050 to hit the uk net zero target this multibillionpound project will also protect and create over 10000 jobs across the humber decarbonising one of the uks most carbon intensive regions whilst developing green skills and kickstarting new industries drax aims for 80 of the materials and services needed for its beccs plans to come from uk supply chain this does not include the carbon capture technology to be delivered by draxs technology partner mitsubishi heavy industries leading climate scientists at the uns ipcc and uk climate change committee have said that the world cannot address the climate crisis without negative emissions from technologies like beccs which permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere work to build beccs at drax could get underway as soon as 2024 with the creation of thousands of jobs subject to the right regulatory support the first beccs unit could be operational in 2027 with the second commissioned in 2030 enabling drax to achieve its worldleading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 beccs at drax will save the uk 13 billion over the coming decade in meeting its climate goals according to an independent report by energy consultancy baringa  about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative

customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed
