which produces enough flexible electricity to power more than 90000 households has been acquired by drax group as part of a 702 million deal 10 january 2019 the pumped storage power station is located in the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan and was built in the 1960s it is part of a portfolio of hydro pumped storage and gas power generation assets which have been sold by spanish company iberdrola to drax group  owners of the uks largest power station at selby in north yorkshire the deal adds a total of 26gw of generation capacity to draxs portfolio reinforcing its position at the heart of great britains energy system drax will now generate enough power for more than 83 million homes with operations in scotland wales yorkshire lancashire london the south east of england the east of england and the east midlands andy koss drax power ceo said as a british energy company were really proud to be the new owners of these critical power stations across scotland were looking forward to working with our new colleagues at each of the sites and playing an increasingly important role in the uks power system weve been to meet the team at cruachan power station and have been impressed with the skill and expertise there  the way this truly unique power station has been built and operates inside the mountain really is an incredible feat of engineering by being able to run the plant in a range of different modes we can generate very flexible power which not only keeps the lights on for thousands of households but also provides crucial system support services to the grid maintaining secure supplies and enabling more renewables like wind power onto the system cruachan is one of only four pumped storage power stations in the uk and works like an enormous rechargeable battery temporarily storing energy by managing water resources between a reservoir in the argyll hills and loch awe 396m below using its reversible turbines the station pumps water from loch awe to fill the upper reservoir at times when demand for electricity is low when demand increases the stored water can be released through the plants turbines to generate power quickly and reliably the plant usually runs for short periods to meet peaks in demand but it can operate continuously at full output for around 15 hours if necessary the scottish assets included in the deal are cruachan pumped storage hydro 440mw in argyll runofriver hydro locations at galloway and lanark 126mw and a biomassfromwaste facility at daldowie near glasgow the combination of hydro plants in scotland with draxs biomass units in yorkshire reinforces the companys position as great britains biggest generator of renewable electricity with the additional 2gw of gas power stations in england acquired through the deal drax will be better placed to provide the flexibility and stability to help underpin more solar and wind power which will be needed in the decades to come if the uk is to meet its climate targets ends media contact ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 editors notes the acquisition of the portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable assets was announced on october 16 2018 and the deal completed on december 31 2018 the deal increases draxs generating capacity by 60 and senior executives from drax are visiting all of the new power stations to meet the teams which operate them the portfolio of assets is highly complementary to draxs existing generation activities and will accelerate its development from a singlesite generation business into a multisite multitechnology operator having converted two thirds of drax power station in selby north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal drax has transformed the business to become the biggest renewable electricity generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe drax group is now the great britains fifth largest nondomestic energy supplier and the biggest supplier of renewable power to uk businesses and organisations with over 350000 now being provided with 100 renewable power photo lr martin mcghie o  m manager cruachan power station will gardiner

electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates
