conclusion of the european unions discussions on the revision of the renewable energy directive rediii 31 march 2023 a provisional agreement has been reached by the european parliament and the council in the revision of the renewable energy directive rediii agreement shows continued support for sustainable biomass recognising its critical role in energy systems and forest management directive will continue to class sustainably sourced woody biomass as a 100 renewable energy source in the eu global renewable energy leader drax group has welcomed a positive conclusion of the european unions discussions on the revision of the renewable energy directive rediii the agreement reached by the eu institutions this week recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass within the region providing renewable reliable power while displacing fossil fuels and supporting good forest management counterproductive and arbitrary proposals presented during the legislative process such as a cap on the use of primary woody biomass have been rejected these would have had serious consequences for eus energy security and forest health the agreement demonstrates the eus continued support for sustainable biomass and will strengthen sustainability standards to reflect good forest management practices and align with the cascading principle to ensure that wood is utilised to its highest economic and environmental added value importantly the updated directive reaffirms sustainably sourced biomass as a 100 percent renewable energy source as well as includes provisions to ensure that biomass goes to the highest value application including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs a vital carbon removal technology in which drax plans to become a global leader drax ceo will gardiner said biomass has a critical role to play in supporting energy security as the world decarbonizes providing reliable renewable power and displacing fossil fuels we are pleased to see the european union recognize the importance of biomass within the region and take steps to further strengthen its sustainability and forestry standards as a global leader in sustainable biomass we are committed to ensuring that the biomass we source has a positive impact on climate nature and the communities in which we operate and hope this decision will ensure biomass continues to play a central role in europes energy transition biomass when sustainably sourced uses sawmill residuals like sawdust harvest residuals including tops branches and bark as well as lowgrade roundwood the market for this fibre helps improve the health and productivity of forests while providing rural counties with a new income stream as the only reliable renewable biomass plays an important role in the uks energy security providing 11 percent of the uks renewable power  enough for five million households the final text of the agreement has yet to be published and drax looks forward to sharing further information with its stakeholders in due course media contact sloan woods media manager e email protected t 07821665493 note to the editors please find the press release from the european council of the european union here for more information about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers drax supplies renewable electricity to uk businesses offering a range of
