national grid how to count carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 31 august 2020 opinion reduced demand boosted renewables and the neartotal abandonment of coal pushed last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions technologies such as beccs  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  read full report pdf  read full report  read press release electric insights q2 2020 report click to viewdownload tags national grid  energy policy  electric insights  decarbonisation  electricity generation the cost of staying in control iain staffell imperial college london opinion the cost of keeping britains power system stable has soared and now adds 20 onto the cost of generating electricity the actions that national grid takes to manage the power system have typically amounted to 5 of generation costs over the last decade but this share has quadrupled over the last two years in the first half of 2020 the cost of these actions averaged 100 million per month supplying electricity to our homes and workplaces needs more than just power stations generating electricity supply and demand must be kept perfectly in balance  and flows of electricity around the country must be actively managed to keep all the interconnected components stable and prevent blackouts national grids costs for taking these actions have been on the rise as we reported over the previous two summers  but recently they have skyrocketed at the start of the decade balancing added about 1mwh to the cost of electricity but last quarter it surpassed 5mwh for the first time see below balancing prices have risen in step with the share of variable renewables the dashed line below shows that for every extra percent of electricity supplied by wind and solar adds 10 pence per mwh to the balancing price last quarter really bucks this trend though and balancing prices have risen 35 above the level expected from this trend the uk energy research centre predicted that wind and solar would add up to 5mwh to the cost of electricity due to their intermittency  and britain has now reached this point albeit a few years earlier than expected this is partly because keeping the power system stable is requiring more interventions than ever before with low demand and high renewable generation national grid is having to order more wind farms to reduce their output at a cost of around 20 million per month they even had to take out a 50 million contract to reduce the output from the sizewell b nuclear reactor at times of system stress left the quarterlyaverage cost of balancing the power system expressed as a percentage of the cost of generation right balancing price shown against share of variable renewables with dots showing the average over each quarter a second reason for the price rise is that national grids costs of balancing are passed on to generators and consumers who pay per mwh as demand has fallen by a sixth since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic the increased costs are being shared out among a smaller base  ofgem has stepped in to cap the balancing service charges at a maximum of 10mwh until late october their covid support scheme will defer up to 100 million of charges until the following year for a quarter of a century the electricity demand in gb ranged from 19 to 58 gw   historically demand minus the intermittent output of wind and solar farms never fell below 14 gw however in each month from april to june this year this net demand fell below 7 gw just as a mclaren sports car is happier going at 70 than 20 mph the national grid is now being forced to operate well outside its comfort zone this highlights the importance of the work that national grid must do towards their ambition to be ready for a zerocarbon system by 2025 the fact we are hitting these limits now rather than in a few years time is a direct result of covid running the system right at its limits is having a shortterm financial impact and is teaching us lessons for the longterm about how to run a leaner and highlyrenewable power system  minimum net demand demand minus wind and solar output in each quarter since 1990 read full report pdf

security  electricity generation  electricity  electric insights  national grid what is the national grid 21 august 2020 power generation what is the grid the national grid or simply the grid is the network of powerlines pylons gas lines and interconnectors that makes up great britains electricity and gas systems  and the engineers technology and rules responsible for their seamless operation it ensures electricity generated anywhere by any source can be transmitted to meet the demand for power wherever its needed across the country it heats homes and businesses it helps us to cook our food the national electricity grid consists of a high voltage transmission system which connects electricity from power stations to substations and smaller local networks  called distribution network operators or dnos  which transport electricity into homes and businesses how does it work transporting electricity around the grid is more complicated than just connecting cables to power generators in order to move power around the country things like voltage and frequency of electricity must be balanced and kept uniform at all times without this unstable electricity could damage equipment and ultimately lead to blackouts the national grid electricity system operator eso is a separate entity from the national grid company and is responsible for maintaining the correct voltage frequency and reserve power levels to ensure electricity is transmitted safely and efficiently at all times it does this by working with power generators and energy storage facilities to provide what are known as  ancillary services   a set of processes that keep the power system in operation stable and balanced the national grid is the network of power stations powerlines and electricity infrastructure that allows electricity to be generated transported and used across the country who controls it in great britain the national grid company owns and operates the transmission systems which ensure electricity is delivered safely and reliably across the country the local distribution system is made up of 14 regional dno companies which deliver electricity at a lower voltage from substations to homes and businesses great britains grid incudes england scotland wales and several surrounding islands northern ireland is part of an islandwide electricity system with the republic of ireland national grid fast facts great britains grid is made up of more than 7000 kilometres of cables 90000 pylons 346 substations and 1500 kilometres of underground cables construction of the grid began on 14 july 1928 and was completed on 5 september 1933 it was originally designed to operate as 7 separate connected grids before a group of rebellion engineers attempted to run it as one on 29 october 1938  it has run as one grid ever since a decade ago britain had 80 individual points of generation to manage today there are nearly one million all electricity in great britain operates at a frequency of 50hz  a deviation of just 1 above or below could cause damage how is the grid changing as the sources that generate great britains electricity change to include more renewables  the grid has also changed the grid was built to work with large power stations that operate huge spinning turbines with decarbonisation its evolved to include a greater variety of intermittent weather dependent sources such as wind solar and decentralised power sources that serve individual buildings or communities this makes managing the grids stability more complicated and requires the use of

services power generation what are ancillary services ancillary services are a set of processes that enable the transportation of electricity around the grid while keeping the power system operating in a stable efficient and safe way why do we need ancillary services when electricity makes its way through the country it needs to be managed so that the power generation and electricity useage levels are equal the regulating of elements such as frequency and voltage has to be carefully managed so that the massive amounts of electricity moving  or transmitted  are able to be used safely in homes businesses schools and hospitals around the country ancillary services enable the power system to operate in a stable efficient and safe way what do ancillary services offer ancillary services include a wide variety of electrical efficiency and safety nets all focussed on ensuring the power system delivers enough output to meet demand yet remains stable frequency the uks power system runs at a frequency of 50 hertz  to stay balanced it has to remain at that frequency turbines and generators adjust the speed at which they spin automatically to increase or decrease power in line with demand and ensure that the system is kept stable voltage different parts of the uks transmission system use voltages of either 400 275 or 132 kilovolts to ensure that voltage remains within 5 of those figures at all times  to be safe for domestic electricity use power stations can produce or reabsorb excess energy as reactive power  keeping the overall system reliable inertia turbine use is important in keeping the system operating in its current state even with disruptions and sudden changes the electricity system uses the weight of heavy spinning turbines to create stability  acting as dampeners and smoothing out unexpected changes in frequency across the network reserve an important part of ancillary servicing is making sure that there are no surprises  so holding back power to release if something unexpected happens means that the network can function confidently knowing that there are generators and other power providers such as pumped hydro storage waiting ready to back it up who manages ancillary services in the uk the grids stability is managed by national grid electricity system operator eso  a separate company of national grid electricity transmission et  the eso works with ancillary service providers to either sign longterm contracts or make short term requests for a service these partners are often power stations such as drax power station which have large spinning turbines capable of controlling voltage frequency providing inertia and serving as a source of reserve power what is the future of ancillary services as we move to a more renewable system as the uks electricity system continues to change so to do its requirements for different ancillary services the switch from a few very large power stations to a greater variety of different electricity sources some of which may be dependent on the weather as well as changes in how the country uses electricity means there is a greater need for ancillary services to keep the grid stable these services have historically been delivered by thermal power stations but new innovations are enabling wind turbines to provide inertial response and overcome changes in frequency and batteries to store reserve power that can then be supplied to the power system to ensure balance ancillary services fast facts batteries can in some cases be cheaper ancillary alternatives to conventional sources of energy the hornsdale power reserve which runs on a tesla battery in south australia lowered the price of frequency ancillary services by 90 after just four months of use ancillary services usually work from habit knowing when to slow electricity production or increase supply based around the general publics standard working hours  dinner time and the early morning rush but during the covid19 lockdown  electricity consumption on weekdays fell by 13 and so national grid eso had to intervene with ancillary services to keep the lights on every year the esos ancillary services move 300 terawatt hours

electrification it may be bulkier than its foreign cousins and its flat back might make it the perfect household booby trap but the uk plug is a modernday design marvel the uks g type or bs 1363 plug is a product of the postwar age but it has endured for the better part of a century ensuring homes business and sockets around the uk have access to safe usable electricity even as the devices they power have changed become smarter and more connected the threeprong g type remains unchanged but to understand how it came into being its worth first understanding what makes it such a unique and clever bit of design  including its role in achieving the ambitions of one of great britains pioneering female engineers and its moneysaving abilities what makes great britains plugs special the modern plug used across great britain as well as ireland cyprus hong kong and malaysia is a smarter and more advanced item than many of its contemporaries this is thanks to a number of key but often overlooked features a collection of international power point illustrations the first is its earth prong connecting the plug to the earth means if a wire comes loose in say a toaster and touches a metal part the device will short circuit as the electricity runs through to make contact with the earth rather than the entire item becoming electrified and dangerous the longer earth prong also plays the role of gatekeeper for the entire plug when a plug enters a socket the longer earth prong enters before any others pushing back plastic shutters that sit over the live and neutral entrances this means when there is no plug in a socket the live and neutral ports which actually carry electric current to devices are covered over making it very difficult for a child to push anything dangerous into the socket what makes the uk plug special click to download another clever feature inside the great british plug comes in the form of a fuse connected to the live wire if theres an unexpected electrical surge the fuse will blow and cut off the connected device preventing fires and electrocutions all packaged together the g type plug is far from the most compact version  yet it is hugely effective however these ideas didnt come together at the flick of a switch prewar plugs going back to end of the 19 th century the idea of owning devices you could move around your house and connect to the electricity circuit from different rooms was novel electricitys main role in homes was for lighting and was fixed into walls and ceilings with their cables hidden it wasnt until the rise of new electrical appliances in the 20 th century that the need for an easy way to plug electrical items into circuits arose a series of twopronged plugs first emerged in 1883 but there was no standardisation of design which would allow any appliance to be plugged into any socket that began to change in 1904 when us inventor harvey hubbell developed a plug that allowed nonbulb electrical devices to be connected into an existing light socket eliminating the need for the installation of new sockets by 1911 a design for a threepronged plug with an earth connection had emerged with manufacturer ap lundberg bringing the first of this kind of plug to britain by 1934 regulations appeared requiring plugs and sockets to include an earthing prong which eventually gave birth to a three cylindricalpronged plug the bs 546 bs 546 plugs the bs 546 was different from the modern gtype as they didnt contain a fuse and were available in five different sizes depending on the needs of the appliance from small 2 ampere plugs for lowpower appliances to a larger 30 ampere version for industrial machinery the different sizes and spacing of the prongs prevented lowpower devices accidentally being plugged into highpower outlets any chance of globally standardising plugs was doomed from the beginning as different companies in different countries all began developing their own plugs for their products as electricity rapidly gained uptake some attempts were made by the international electrotechnical commission iec to standardise plugs globally but the second world war put a stop to any progress electricity for the people great britain emerged from the second world war with its national grid standing strong  the challenge now was to make electricity not just the power source of factories and wealthy peoples homes but something available for everyone in the wave of new postwar construction other countries not seeing as much damage to their housing stock as the uk did not have the same opportunity to rethink domestic electricity to such an extent therefore the institution of electrical engineers iee assembled a 20person committee to consider the electrical requirements of the countrys new homes breaking new ground caroline haslett the sole woman on the committee caroline haslett had been breaking new ground for female engineers since before world war one in her career she worked with turbine inventor charles parsons and his wife an engineer in her own right and in 1932 became the first woman selected to join the iee her passion for electricity went so far as for her will to request she be cremated via electricity she had long believed in the potential for domestic electricity to improve womens lives by freeing them from the drudgery of preelectric domestic chores from handwashing clothes to cooking on coalfuelled stoves this included ensuring electricity was safe for the people using electricity around the home which in the 1940s was primarily women who also did the vast majority of childcare hasletts drive to make electricity safe in the home was pivotal in shaping many of the iees safety requirements for postwar domestic electricity including what have become the countrys standard plugs and sockets there was another factor aside from safety at play the material cost of the war meant copper the main material used in electrical wiring was in short supply so the iee came up with a new way of wiring homes that would in turn shape our plugs shifting fuses to save copper before the war british sockets were all separately wired back to a central fuse box it made sense because if something went wrong only the fuse connected to that socket would blow rather than the whole house however to cut the amount of copper used the iee instead proposed a clever workaround where the homes electrical sockets are looped up in one ring circuit with the fuses moved to the plugs themselves so if something went wrong in an appliance the fault would stop at the plug where the fuse could easily be accessed and replaced lighting fixtures remained wired in a separate circuit from sockets as they require less current to operate copper was short in supply during world war two this hidden fuse is a big differentiator from other plug types and adds to the g types safety credentials however the iee had to ensure people did not mistakenly insert older threeprong bs 546 plug styles without fuses into the sockets the answer was as simple as switching the socket holes from round to rectangle it means the older round cylinder prongs wouldnt fit into the slot designed for the rectangles found on plugs today the g type plug might seem cumbersome compared to the european or us models but in the 70plus years since its introduction its three prongs and inbuilt fuse has proved an enduring design that can power new devices and smart technology while remaining one of the safest plugs in the world tags technology  engineering  national grid  customers  electricity the uk needs negative emissions from beccs to reach net zero  heres why 7 april 2020 carbon capture reaching the uks target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate agreement beccs has the potential to play a vital role in power generation creating a hydrogen economy and offsetting other emissions as it continues to

generating power 12 february 2020 power generation massive spinning machinery is a big part of electricity generation whether its a wind turbine hydro plant or biomass generator but big spinning turbines dont just pump electricity out onto the grid they also play a crucial role in keeping the electricity system stable safe and efficient this is because big heavy spinning turbines add something else to the grid inertia  this is defined as an objects resistance to change but in the context of electricity it helps the grid remain at the right frequency and voltage level in short they help the grid remain stable however as electricity systems in great britain and other parts of the world move away from coal and gas to renewables such as wind turbines solar panels and interconnectors the level of inertia on the system is falling we need the inertia we dont need the megawatts explains julian leslie head of networks at the national grid electricity system operator eso but in todays market we have to supply the megawatts and receive the inertia as a consequence engineer inspecting turbine blades at drax power station the national grid eso is taking a new approach to this aspect of grid stability by using what are called synchronous condensers these complicatedsounding pieces of machinery are actually quite straightforward in their concept they provide inertia to the grid without generating unnecessary power these come in the form of existing generators that remain connected to the grid but refrain from producing electricity purpose built machines whose only function is to act as synchronous condensers never generating real power these may be fitted with flywheels to increase their mass and in consequence their inertia this means that spinning without generating is about to become a very important part of great britains electricity system around and around electricity generators that spin at 3000 rpm are described as synchronous generators because they are in sync with the grids frequency of 50hz these include coal gas hydro biomass turbines and nuclear units most spin at 3000 rpm some machines much less eg 750 rpm thanks to the way they are designed they are all synchronised together at the same higher speed then there are wind turbines where the generated power is not synchronised to the grid system termed asynchronous generators these machines do not have readily accessible stored energy inertia and do not contribute to the stability of the system interconnectors and solar panels are also asynchronous its important that great britains whole grid is kept within 1 of the 50hz frequency  otherwise the voltage of electricity starts to fluctuate damaging equipment becoming less efficient even dangerous or resulting in blackouts say a power station or a wind farm were to drop offline as occurred in august 2019  this would cause the amount of power on the grid to suddenly fall but it is not just the power that changes  the frequency and voltage also fluctuate dramatically which can cause equipment damage and ultimately towns cities or widespread areas to lose power running machines that have inertia act like the suspension on a car  they dampen those fluctuations so they are not as drastic the big spinning machines keep spinning buying valuable milliseconds for the grid to react often automatically before the damage becomes widespread however as a consequence of decarbonisation more solar panels and wind turbines are now on the system and there are fewer spinning turbines leading to lower levels of inertia on the grid there are periods when renewable generation and flow from interconnectors are so great that it displaces all conventional rotational power plants says leslie today bringing more inertia onto the grid may mean switching off renewables or interconnectors and then replacing them with rotating plants and the megawatts associated with that creating a market for inertia and synchronous condensers offers a new way forward  providing inertia without unneeded megawatts or emissions from fossil fuels a new spin on grid stability at the start of 2020 the national grid eso began contracting parties including draxs cruachan pumpedhydro power station  to operate synchronous condensers and provide inertia to the grid when needed the plans mark a departure from the previous system where inertia and voltage control from electricity generators was taken for granted cruachan power station is already capable of running its units in synchronous condenser mode one of its units opened up for maintenance is pictured at the top of this article this involves an alternator acting as a motor offering inertia to the grid without generating unneeded electricity other service providers will repurpose existing turbines construct new machines or develop new technologies that can electronically respond to the grids need for stability synchronous condensers or the idea of spinning a turbine freely without generating power are not new concepts power stations in the second half of the 20 th century could shut down certain generating units but keep them spinning online for voltage control in the 1960s and 70s some substations  where the voltage of electricity is stepped up and down from the transmission system  also deployed standalone synchronous condensers these were also used to provided inertia as well as voltage control but are long since decommissioned synchronous condenser installation at templestowe substation melbourne victoria australia by mriya via wikimedia  synchronous condensers are a proven technology that have been used in the past says leslie and there are many new technologies we are now exploring that can deliver a similar service cheaper cleaner more stable the national grid eso estimates the technology will save electricity consumers up to 128 million over the next six years savings which come from negating the need for the grid to call upon fossil fuels for inertia as coal oil and gas become increasingly uneconomical across the globe as carbon taxes grow the fact that synchronous condensers do not produce electricity also saves money the grid may have had to pay out to renewable generators to stop them producing electricity or to storage systems to absorb excess power it means the market can deliver the renewable flow without the grid having to pay to restrain it or to pay for gas to stabilise the system says leslie not only does this allow more renewable generation but it also reduces the cost to the consumer in a future energy system where there is an abundance of renewable electricity generations synchronous condensers will be crucial in keeping the grid stable the national grid esos investment in the technology further highlights the importance of new ideas and innovation to balance the grid through this energy transition  synchronous generation provides benefits to system stability beyond the provision of inertia in a subsequent article well also explore how synchronous condensers can assist with voltage stability and help regional electricity networks and customers to remain connected to

decarbonisation  electricity  electricity generation  flexibility and stability and power system security  electricity system balancing and ancillary services maintaining electricity grid stability during rapid decarbonisation 13 november 2019 power generation great britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the
