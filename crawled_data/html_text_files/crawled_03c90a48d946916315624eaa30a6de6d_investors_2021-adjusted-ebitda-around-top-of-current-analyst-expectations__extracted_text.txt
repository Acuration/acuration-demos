power sales on biomass roc 2 units since july 2021 capturing higher prices commissioning of 550kt of new biomass pellet production capacity in us southeast 2021 adjusted ebitda 3  around the top end of current range of analyst expectations subject to continued baseload generation on biomass units throughout december positive policy developments for biomass and framework for uk beccs 4 pellet production in north america the group has made good progress integrating pinnacle renewable energy inc pinnacle since acquisition in april 2021 and is currently in the final stages of commissioning over 360kt of new production capacity at demopolis alabama in october 2021 the group commissioned a 150kt expansion at its lasalle plant in louisiana and at leola arkansas a new 40kt satellite plant is due to be commissioned in december these developments alongside incremental new capacity in 2022 support the groups continued focus on production capacity expansion and cost reduction once fully commissioned drax will operate around 5mt of production capacity across three major north american fibre baskets  british columbia alberta and the us southeast of which around 2mt are contracted to highquality thirdparty counterparties under longterm contracts with the balance available for draxs ownuse requirements there has been no disruption to ownuse or thirdparty volumes from the global supply chain delays currently being experienced in some other sectors however as outlined at the groups 2021 half year results summer wildfires led to pellet export restrictions in canada more recently heavy rainfall and flooding in british columbia have led to some further disruption to rail movements and regional supply chains through its enlarged and diversified supply chain drax has been able to manage and limit the impact on biomass supply for ownuse and to customers in addition due to the groups active and longterm hedging of freight costs there has been no material impact associated with higher market prices for ocean freight the group uses longterm contracts to hedge its freight exposure on biomass for its generation business and following the acquisition of pinnacle is taking steps to optimise freight requirements between production centres in the us southeast and western canada and end markets in asia and europe generation in the uk the groups biomass and pumped storage generation assets have continued to play an important role providing stability to the uk power system at a time when higher gas prices european interconnector issues and periods of low wind have placed the system under increased pressure the groups strong forward sold position means that it has not been a significant beneficiary of higher power prices from these activities in 2021 but has been able to increase forward hedged prices in 2022 and 2023 in march the groups two legacy coal units ended commercial generation activities and will formally close in september 2022 following the fulfilment of their capacity market obligations reflecting the system challenges described above these units were called upon in the balancing mechanism by the system operator for limited operations in september and november these shortterm measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and have not resulted in any material increase in the groups total carbon emissions in september the generation business experienced a twoweek unplanned outage on one biomass unit operating under the roc scheme the units contracted position in this period was bought back and the generation reprofiled across the two unaffected biomass roc units and deferred until the fourth quarter during this period the groups pumped storage power station cruachan provided risk mitigation from the operational or financial impact of any additional forced outages in november the generation business successfully completed a major 98 day planned outage on its biomass cfd unit which included the third in a series of highpressure turbine upgrades drax now expects the unit to benefit from thermal efficiency improvements and lower maintenance costs incrementally reducing the cost of biomass generation at drax power station customers the group continues to expect the customers business will return to profitability at the adjusted ebitda level for 2021 inclusive of an expected increase in mutualisation costs associated with the failure of a number of energy supply businesses in the second half of 2021 separately the group is continuing to assess operational and strategic solutions to support the development of the sme 5 supply business full year expectations reflecting these factors the group now expects that full year adjusted ebitda for 2021 will be around the top of the range of current analyst expectations 6  subject to good operational performance during december including baseload running of all four biomass units the groups financial expectations do not include any balancing mechanism activity in december for the coal units drax continues to expect net debt to adjusted ebitda to return to around 2x by the end of 2022 negative emissions in october the uk government selected the east coast cluster and hynet as the first two regional clusters in the uk to take forward the development of the infrastructure required for carbon capture and storage in addition the uk government published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and indicating that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support the development of beccs to meet these requirements the group is continuing to progress its work on beccs with the aim to develop 8mt of negative co 2 emissions pa at drax power station by 2030 and expects to make a decision on the commencement of a full design study in the coming weeks generation contracted power sales as at 25 november 2021 drax had 343twh of power hedged between 2021 and 2023 at 613mwh as follows 2021 2022

obligation certificate 4 contract for difference 5 small and mediumsize enterprise 6 as at 26 november 2021 analyst consensus for 2021 adjusted ebitda was 380 million with a range of 374391 million the details of this company collected consensus are displayed on the groups website 7 the cfd biomass unit typically operates as a baseload unit with power sold forward against a season ahead reference price the cfd counterparty pays the difference between the season ahead reference price and the strike price the contracted position therefore only includes cfd volumes and prices for the front six months 8 expected annual cfd volumes of around 5twh lower level of generation in 2021 unit due to major planned outage enquiries drax investor relations mark strafford 44 0 7730 763 949
