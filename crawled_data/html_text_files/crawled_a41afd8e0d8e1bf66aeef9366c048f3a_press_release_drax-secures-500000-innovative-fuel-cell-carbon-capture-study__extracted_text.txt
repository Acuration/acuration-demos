feasibility of using molten carbonate fuel cells as a technology for capturing carbon dioxide co2 having secured 500000 of funding from the uk government 27 june 2019 fuel cell feed study to assess the feasibility of building a second carbon capture pilot at drax power station will help position the uk as a world leader in the fight against climate change the technology used will produce power at the same time as capturing carbon dioxide from draxs flue gases neighbouring horticultural site will use the co 2 to improve yields and demonstrate how businesses working together in clusters can deliver climate solutions th government funding will be used to explore using fuelcell energys molten carbon fuel cell to generate electricity whilst capturing co 2 from the flue gases produced during the combustion of biomass for renewable power generation at drax httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201906howamoltencarbonatefuelcellworksprivatelink1mp4 once captured the co 2 will be transported to a horticultural site which is located next to the power station to help improve its greenhouse yields will gardiner drax group ceo said we believe fuel cell technology could help us to meet the rise in global demand for electricity whilst capturing the carbon dioxide produced during its generation our feed study will help us to understand the technical and economic feasibility of fuel cells with a view to scaling the technology up whilst showing that clusters of businesses working together to deliver climate change solutions can also deliver benefits for their business chris skidmore energy  clean growth minister said cutting edge technology to capture carbon will cut emissions as we work towards a net zero economy while creating new jobs  a key part of our modern industrial strategy this innovative project from drax represents a major milestone in efforts to rollout carbon capture at scale by the 2030s the technology developed by usbased fuelcell energy captures the co 2 from an external flue gas stream whilst also generating electricity this gives the technology a potential advantage over solventbased systems which can consume heat and electricity in order to operate carbon capture using fuelcell energys solution is a potential gamechanger for affordability and efficiency of concentrating and capturing carbon dioxide from emitters said tony leo executive vice president chief technology officer fuelcell energy we are pleased to have the opportunity to partner with drax and beis for such an innovative and critically important subject as cleaner energy the feed study will explore the potential for utilising the co 2 from the fuel cell pilot to help improve crop yields tomatoes and other salad crops will be grown by aps group in huge greenhouses owned by p3p partners which are next to drax power station click to viewdownload graphic philip elborne business development manager at p3p partners llp said we are really excited to be working with drax on their fuel cell carbon capture project we pride ourselves on building and operating high quality efficient combined heat and power systems and are committed to delivering the most value to our customers being able to utilise co 2 captured from this system into our glasshouses will help us to achieve this while supporting the goal to reduce emissions phil pearson group development director at aps group said this exciting partnership with drax will enable carbon dioxide captured at their power station to be piped to our neighbouring glasshouses to produce high quality salad crops we have already deployed gasfired combined heat and power systems on all of our british glasshouse nurseries to produce clean electricity for local communities whilst using the carbon dioxide and heat to grow the crops with negligible waste drax power station in north yorkshire is the uks largest renewable power generator after converting two thirds of the plant to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it is now looking at a range of technologies which could enable it to capture the carbon dioxide released from the combustion of biomass to become the worlds first negative emissions power station the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs could enable the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  approximately half the nations emissions target the front end engineering design feed study will be completed at drax later this year ends we have an animation  httpsvimeocom329448083a9c9b21224  which shows how the fuel cell technology works  as well as a graphic  httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201906drax_fuel_greenhouse_v6jpg  showing how co 2 produced at drax power station will be transported to the salad farm nearby media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 44 0 771 267 0888 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 44 0 771 267 7177 editors notes the funding for the fuel cell front end engineering design feed study at drax was secured through the governments ccud phase 2 competition the fuelcell system captures up to 85 tonnes of co 2 per day while generating additional power the fuel cell runs on natural gas which creates additional co 2 emissions  these are also captured during the process it will also destroy up to 70 of the nox emissions from draxs flue gases fces carbonate fuel cell is modular and this demonstration project will utilise two standard fuel cell modules similar to fces suresource3000 commercial power generation system drax power station is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world  around 75 of the electricity it produces is renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  delivering negative emissions the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 drax is already capturing a tonne of co 2 from its first beccs pilot project  the first of its kind in the world using an organic solvent developed by leeds university spin out ccapture drax announced in may it had signed a memorandum of understanding with equinor and national grid ventures the three energy companies will work together to explore how a largescale carbon capture usage and storage ccus network and a hydrogen production facility could be constructed in the humber in the mid2020s drax is also working with deep branch biotechnology to utilise the carbon captured at drax power station the pilot project will create protein from the carbon which can be used as sustainable animal feed there are other markets which drax expects to provide significant opportunities such as using the co 2 captured in the creation of synthetic fuels which could help other hard to decarbonise sectors like aviation to reduce emissions about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business
