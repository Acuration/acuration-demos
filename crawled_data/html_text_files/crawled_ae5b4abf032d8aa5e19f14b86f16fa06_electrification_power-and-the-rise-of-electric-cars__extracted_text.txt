power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station power and the rise of electric cars electric vehicles are touted as the future of urban transport but what does an increase in electricity used for transport mean for the network supplying it 12 december 2016 electrification all great technological innovations need infrastructure to match the world didnt change from candles to lightbulbs overnight  power stations had to be built electricity cables rolled out and buildings fitted with wiring the same is true of electric vehicles ev think of the number of petrol stations lining the uk roads if evs continue their rise in popularity the country will need electric carcharging facilities to augment and then replace these petrol stations this could mean big extensions of electricity grid infrastructure both in the building of new power generation capacity to meet demand and in the extension of the networks themselves in short it could mean a significant change in how electricity is used and supplied the need for better electricity infrastructure in 2013 only 3500 of newly registered cars in the uk were plugin electric or hybrid evs in 2016 that number jumped to 63000 their use is rising rapidly but the lack of infrastructure has kept a cap on the number of evs on uk roads that is starting to change as of 2019 all new and refurbished houses in the eu will have to be fitted with an electric car charging point  according to a draft directive announced by brussels the uk will probably no longer be an eu member by the time the directive comes into effect but nevertheless the uk government is pursuing its own ways to account for the rise of evs it has pledged more than 600 million between 2015 and 2020 to support ultralowemission vehicles  38 million of this has already been earmarked for public charging points there are more innovative responses to ev rise too nissan in partnership with italian energy provider enel has announced it will install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk with their innovative v2g technology  cars plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary so when there is a peak in demand the grid could access the cars stored energy to help meet it the total capacity of the 18000 nissan electric vehicles currently operational on uk roads comes to around 180 mw so even today  before electric vehicles have really taken off  this could give the national grid an additional supply roughly the size of a small power station peaks in electricity demand however tend to occur in the late afternoon or evening as it gets dark and more lighting and heating gets switched on this also happens to be rush hour so under this scheme the time of day the cars are most likely to be on the roads is also when itd be most helpful to have them plugged in this could lead to financial incentives for people to give up the flexibility of driving their cars only when they need to more electric cars more demand for electricity more pollution more evs on the road makes sound environmental sense  they enable a 40 reduction in co2 emissions  but ultimately the energy still has to come from somewhere that means more power stations the scale of this new demand shouldnt be underestimated if european drivers were to go 80 electric some studies have suggested it would require 150 gw of additional ondemand capacity  the equivalent of 40 draxsized power stations but if evs are to live up to their green potential that additional power needs to come from innovations in storage such as in the nissan example and from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass fossil fuels would ideally be used only to plug any gaps that intermittency creates  for example by briefly firing up the small gas power stations drax plans to build in england and wales what does this mean for generators drax as operator of the uks largest biomass power station and with plans for new rapid response open cycle gas turbines ocgts is well placed to be at the forefront of providing reliable affordable power in the event of a widespread rollout of electric vehicles the ocgts in particular are designed for use in peak times which in the future could be when the nations electric vehicles are plugged in overnight  today this is when electricity demand is at its lowest a future of more electric cars is a positive one theyre cleaner more efficient and they are well suited to our increasingly urban lives but now that we have the technology we need to ensure we can deliver the lowercarbon infrastructure they need share related stories press releases britain breaks record for greening its grid press releases drax helps
