power station drax group ceo will gardiner responds to the governments net zero strategy 19 october 2021 will gardiner ceo drax group  said drax group ceo will gardiner the governments net zero strategy published today is a key step forward as the uk looks towards a zerocarbon future its also a clear endorsement of the vital role that drax will continue to play in helping the uk reach its net zero targets it highlights the significant contributions that both our negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and the expansion of our pumped storage hydro capacity could play in generating renewable energy in the uk for the uk whilst also addressing the climate crisis it is important that the government now advances its plans to develop business models for greenhouse gas removal technologies so as to enable companies like drax to invest in these and ensure their deployment in the 2020s background beccs at drax government proposals envisage that by 2030 significant deployment of mature beccs technologies will be required with retrofit applications in the power and industrial sectors beccs applications in the power sector could be deployed by the late 2020s and potentially achieve ambitious contributions to our ndc target by 2030 strategy stresses the need for engineered ggrs to deploy over the next decade with an estimated 23mt of co2 needed to be removed by 2035 and between 75 and 81mt by 2050 new government ambition to deliver at least 5mtco2year of engineered greenhouse gas removals ggrs by 2030 drax is ready to invest more than 2bn in two beccs units at drax power station with the creation of tens of thousands of jobs once up and running beccs at drax will permanently remove at least 8mt of co2 from the atmosphere each year whilst supporting the creation of a new global industry in the uk delivering tens of thousands of jobs in a new green economy this builds on what we have already achieved with sustainable biomass in transforming a coal fired power station to become europes biggest decarbonisation project the uk has decarbonised its energy system faster than any other countrys as a result of the support the government made available to renewables like offshore wind solar and biomass with the right policies the same could be achieved for negative emissions technologies  demonstrating the same global climate leadership the uk has a track record of delivering drax power station produces 12 of the uks renewable electricity keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses we have reduced our emissions by more than 90 in the last decade and drax is now one of europes lowest carbon energy generators cruachan expansion the strategy outlines flexibility and storage technologies as one of the three key pillars to support the decarbonisation of the power system alongside renewables and nuclear like draxs existing cruachan facility in argyll the new station will be able to provide lifeline stability services to the power system alongside acting like a giant water battery by using reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside the station can store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand the stored water would then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this will help to cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power the new station would have the capacity to generate enough power for around a million homes the new 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the new power station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side to the east of draxs existing 440mw pumped storage hydro station more than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station the existing upper reservoir which can hold 24 billion gallons of water has the capacity to serve both power stations if planning consent is given for the new power station the extra capacity could be available in 2030 alongside planning consent the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the lack of an existing framework for largescale longduration storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation the government recently issued a call for evidence to explore the need to provide further market intervention to support lles technologies share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable bioenergy forests net zero and
