power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station next generation of engineers kick start careers at drax drax power station has increased its intake of apprentices this year by almost 50 as part of its drive to retain and develop its in house engineering skill and expertise 30 august 2018 the technical apprentice scheme at drax offers apprentices the chance to learn a trade develop new skills and launch their career in engineering at the uks biggest power station and the largest decarbonisation project in europe the nine apprentices will be trained in engineering to work within the maintenance department at drax power station near selby in north yorkshire they will work on new and recently upgraded plant designed to process biomass and the maintenance of the power station having upgraded two thirds of the power station from coal to use renewable biomass nearly 70 of the power produced at drax power station is now renewable  enough for four million households andy koss drax power ceo said i welcome this years apprentices  they have a really bright future ahead of them apprenticeships are vital to our success as a business having talented people at all stages of their careers is important in building and retaining the skilled workforce we need if we are to continue to innovate and enable the business to grow as one of the major employers in the northern powerhouse region we have an important role to play in helping to drive up standards in education by making sure children and young people have inspirational experiences in the world of work at drax were delivering on that both by increasing the number of apprenticeships were offering and through the outreach work we do with schools and colleges which enables thousands of students to visit the power station each year this years apprentices from selby goole doncaster north lincolnshire and gainsborough are aged between 16 and 19 jamie goodall 16 from addingfleet near goole said im really looking forward to getting some handson practical experience i was really ready to get out of a school classroom and start learning in a different way so its exciting to be here 18yearold cameron shipstone from hemingbrough near selby added my dad works at drax and has done so his whole working life i visited the power station when i was young and saw the scale of everything and all the interesting things that were going on i then did some work experience at drax and realised a career in engineering was so much more appealing than going to uni  i cant wait to get started now andy koss continued many of our engineers section heads and department managers are former drax apprentices who have spent 30 years or more at the plant were doing a lot of exciting things at the moment so its a great time to join  weve just successfully converted our fourth generating unit from coal to biomass and were also exploring options for repowering our two remaining coal units to gas and developing largescale battery storage the drax apprenticeship training scheme is a fouryear programme and specialises in three engineering disciplines mechanical electrical and control  instrumentation drax offers apprenticeships in engineering disciplines as well as business support areas such as finance and business administration all opportunities are advertised on our website  ends media contact jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 01757 612848 notes to editors drax has a longstanding commitment to stem learning with around 13000 educational visits to
