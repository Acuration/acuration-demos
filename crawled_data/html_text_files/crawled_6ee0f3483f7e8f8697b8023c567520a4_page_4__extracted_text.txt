technology winter on the hollow mountain 15 january 2020 power generation scotlands landscape is defined by its weather the millennia of wind rain and snow has battered the country ebbing away at its rivers mountains valleys and deep lochs forged by ice ages and volcanos weather also plays an important role in the countrys power generation the country has more than 9 gigawatts gw of installed wind power  enough to sometimes meet double scotlands electricity demand  as well as having a long history of hydropower but while it is an intrinsic part of the country scotlands weather can be anything but pleasant rain can be persistent and when the temperature drops in winter it turns to snow  a lot of it scotland gets more snow than any other part of the uk scottish poet robert burns described the harshness of the winter months in his 1781 poem winter a dirge the wintry west extends his blast and hail and rain does blaw or the stormy north sends driving forth the blinding sleet and snaw sleet and snaw snow fall occurs on average for 38 days a year in scotland compared to an average of 23 days across the rest of the united kingdom and can remain covering mountaintops long into spring ben cruachan the peak of ben cruachan in the western highlands is no exception cruachan power station  on the slopes of the mountain however must be ready to either generate or absorb electricity through all forms of weather  even the most severe on a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that weve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time says gordon pirie a civil engineer at cruachan thankfully we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely mountain road from cruachan power station to its dam blocked due to snow this mountainside location and winter weather can make for tough working conditions but cruachan is designed to handle it in fact in some cases it benefits from it taking advantage of wet weather cruachan is built around the geography and climate of the highlands it stores water in an upper reservoir 400 meters 1312 feet up ben cruachan and uses its elevation to run it down the mountain spin a turbine and generate power and when there is excess electricity being generated nationally the same turbines reverse and use the excess electricity to pump water from loch awe up to the reservoir helping to balance the grid this acts as a form of energy storage by essentially stockpiling the excess electricity in the form of water held in the top reservoir for the most part the water used to generate electricity comes exclusively from loch awe and is passed up and down the mountain however 10 of it comes for free as its collected from natural rainfall and surface water that makes its way to the upper reservoir through cruachans aqueducts this system of 14 kilometres of interconnected concrete pipes covers a 23 square kilometre radius around the reservoir and is designed to bring in water from 75 intakes dotted around the top of the mountain a north of scotland hydroelectric board diagram from c1960s showing the aqueducts feeding cruachans dam click to viewdownload some of these intakes are as small as street drains while others are large enough to drive a land rover into its part of piries job to keep them in good working order so they continue to deliver water to the reservoir as the intakes are scattered around the mountaintop they must be able to deal with whatever the scottish winter throws at them gordon pirie civil engineer and cruachan power station dam even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system the intakes have a builtin feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid explains pirie any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir as spring arrives and snow begins to thaw across the highlands greater volumes of water will run off into the reservoir and the power stations engineers work to manage the water level keeping water pressure under control thawing snow can bring greater volumes of water into the reservoir the power station must be able to pump water and absorb excess electricity from the grid at a moments notice this ability to turn excess electricity into stored energy makes cruachan hugely useful in controlling the grids voltage frequency and in keeping it stable  however there must be enough space available in the reservoir for the water being pumped up the mountainside to enter  even when excessive rainfall or melting snow begins to naturally fill it up the power station can control the reservoir levels through a number of means this includes the ability to close off an aqueduct or to run the turbines without generating electricity so the team can move water from the reservoir into loch awe below if the water level and pressure on the dam reaches dangerous levels a dispenser valve can be opened in an emergency sending a jet of water flying out the dam to cascade safely down the mountainside however outside of testing this has never been necessary to do and while the weather might be the most persistent natural force the power station must deal with its not the only one recently we had an issue with a bat roosting within one of the tunnels in which we were carrying out stabilisation works recalls pirie it was looking for a suitable location to hibernate for the winter and the tunnel provided the ideal environment we had to stop works to have a bat survey undertaken and apply for a bat license cruachans location makes for stunning views of the highlands but occasionally brutally cold and perilously wet conditions come with the territory for the power station team working with the sometimesdespairing weather is all part of what allows the hollow mountain to operate as it has done for more than half a century the highlands around ben cruachan are rich with wildlife educational

hydroelectric power  cruachan power station how scotlands sewage becomes renewable energy 17 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy from traffic pollution to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys energy it would add another source of renewable fuel to great britains electricity mix that could help to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future tags

towards the west coast of scotland you pass the mighty ben cruachan  its 1126 metre peak towers over the winding loch awe beneath it is the natural world on a huge scale but within its granite core sits a manmade engineering wonder cruachan power station  opened by the queen in 1965 it is one of only four pumpedhydro stations in the uk and today remains just as impressive an engineering feat as when it was first opened cruachan is operated safely and hasnt had a lost time injury in 15 years the robust health and safety policies and practices employed at the power station were not in place all those decades ago it took six years to construct enlisting a 4000strong workforce who drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain eventually removing some 220000 cubic metres of rubble the work was physically exhausting  the environment dark and dangerous nicknamed the tunnel tigers the men that carried the work out came from far and wide attracted to its ambition as well as a generous pay packet reflective of the danger and difficulty of the work but few of them were fully prepared for the extent of the challenge one labourer who started at cruachan just after his 18 th birthday recalls i was in for a shock when i went down there the heat the smoke  you couldnt see your hands in front of you inside the mountain the work of hollowing out ben cruachan was realised by handdrilling twotothree metre deep holes into the granite rockface an explosive known as gelignite which can be moulded by hand was packed into the drilled holes and detonated the blasted rocks were removed by bulldozers trucks and shovels before drilling began on the fresh section of exposed granite in total 20km of tunnels and chambers were excavated this way including the kilometrelong entrance tunnel and the 91metrelong 36metrehigh machine hall wilson scott was just 18 when he got a job working as a labourer at cruachan while the machine hall was being cleared out the gelignite it had a smell right away i was told not to put it near your face he says itll give you a splitting headache and your eyes will close with the fumes that come off it it was scary stuff this process allowed for rapid expansion through the mountain with three or four blasts each 12hour shift some 20 metres of rock could be cleared in the course of a day activity was constant and to save the men having to make the journey back up to the surface refreshments came to them there was a bus that went down the tunnel at 11 oclock with a huge urn of terrible tea says scott most of the windows were out of the bus because the pressure of the blasting had blown them in the tea did little to make the environment hospitable however from the water dripping through the porous rocks making floors slippery and exposed electrics vulnerable to the massive machinery rushing through the dense dust and smoke danger was everpresent loose rocks as large as cars would often fall from exposed walls and ceilings while the regular blasting gave the impression the entire mountain was shaking ill tell you something going into that tunnel the first time scott says it was a fascinating place but quite a scary place too above them on top of the mountain a similarly intrepid team tackled a different challenge building the 316metrelong dam they may have escaped the hot and humid conditions at the centre of cruachan but their task was no less daunting cruachan dam construction early 1960s on top of the dam out in the open 400 metres above loch awe the team were exposed to the harsh scottish elements john william ross came to cruachan at the age of 35 to work as a driver and spent time working in the open air of the dam youd get oil skins and welly boots and that was it we didnt have gloves if your hands froze  well thats tough luck isnt it mr ross sadly passed away recently charlie campbell a 19yearold shutter joiner who worked on the dam found an innovative way around the cold youd put on your socks and then youd get womens tights and youd put them over the top of the socks and then youd put your wellies on and thatd keep your feet a wee bit warmer we thought it did anyway maybe it was just the thought of the womens stockings pouring the concrete of the dam  almost 50 metres high at its tallest point  was precarious work especially given the challenges of working with materials like concrete and bentonite a slurrylike liquid used in construction it was horrible stuff it was like diarrhoea thats the only way of explaining it says campbell there was a boy  toastie  i cant remember his real name he fell into it they had quite a job getting him out they thought he was drowned but he was alright many others were not alright the danger of the work and conditions both inside and on top of the mountain meant there was a significant human cost for the project during construction 15 people tragically lost their lives today a carved wooden mural hangs on the wall of the machine hall to capture and commemorate the myth of the mountain and the men who sadly died  a constant reminder of the bravery and sacrifice they made the men that made the mountain the cruachan tunnel tigers the tunnel tigers were united in their efforts but came from a range of backgrounds and cultures polish and irish labourers worked alongside scots as well as displaced europeans prisoners of the second world war and even workers from as far as asia the men would work 12 sometimes 18hour shifts seven days a week campbell adds that some men opted to continue earning rather than rest by doing a ghoster which saw them working a solid 36 hours many men would make treble the salary of their previous jobs with some receiving as much as 100 a week at a time when the average pay in scotland was 12 some teams payslips were stamped with the words danger money  illustrative of the mens motivation to endure such lifethreatening work while it was a dangerous and demanding job many of the tigers look back with fond memories of their time on the site and many stayed in the area for years after it was an experience im glad i had says scott it puts you in good stead for the rest of your days as for cruachan power station its four turbines are still relied on today by great britain to balance everyday energy supply as the electricity system continues to change the pumped hydro stations dual ability to deliver 440 megawatts mw of electricity in just 30 seconds or absorb excess power from the grid by pumping water from loch awe to its upper reservoir is even more important than when it opened cruachan machine hall roof excavation 1962 cruachan machine hall construction 1964 cruachan machine hall 2019 standing at the foot of a mountain more than 50 years ago the men about to build a power station inside a lump of granite may have found it unlikely their work would endure into the next millennium they may have found it unlikely it was possible to build it at all

storage  hydroelectric power  cruachan power station from coal to pumped hydro storage in 83 mountainous miles 7 october 2019 power generation nestled in in the western highlands in scotland cruachan power station is surrounded by a breathtaking landscape of plunging mountainsides and curving lochs between which weave narrow roads it makes for scenic driving what might be trickier however is transporting 230 tonnes of electrical equipment up and down said mountains navigating narrow bends but thats exactly what a team from drax was tasked with when it came to moving two 115 tonne transformers the equipment used to boost electricitys voltage they were in storage 83 miles away at longannet currently being demolished near fife youre moving a piece of equipment that is designed to stay in one place its not designed to go on the roads explains jamie beardsall an electrical engineer from the eci engineering team who worked on the project youre very aware of your environment and the risks everything is checked and doubled checked transformers being driven to draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station the complicated task required colleagues from both cruachan and drax power stations to collaborate from the very beginning gary brown mark rowbottom and jamie from the eci engineering team based in yorkshire teamed up with gordon pirie and roddy davies from scotland who met frequently and planned the project alongside specialist transport contractor ale which advised on heavy lifting and movement planning and execution of the works also required constant liaison and coordination with the police and highway authorities in both scotland and england but more than that the transformers onebyone journey from the demolition site of what was once europes biggest coalfired power station  to a hydropowered energy storage site on the other side of scotland represents the continual shift of great britains electricity away from fossil fuels stepping up voltage transformers are an essential part of the electricity system by increasing or decreasing the voltage of an electrical current they can enable it to traverse the national grid or make electricity safe to enter our homes when we generate electricity it is at a lower voltage than we need to send it out to the national grid says beardsall we use transformers to increase the voltage so it can go out to the national grid and be transmitted over long distances more efficiently we then reduce the voltage again so it can be brought safely into our homes while all transformers apply the same principles for stepping voltage up and down  the two transformers that were transported through the highlands to cruachan were designed specifically for the pumped storage hydro power station but stored at longannet where there was more space at the time both stations where owned by scottish power cruachan was purchased by drax on the last day of 2018 engineers at cruachan power station in front of one of the original transformers when transported each transformer weighs 115 tonnes and is almost four metres high transporting them isnt as simple as loading them into the back of a van you cant transport them in a fully built state they would be too heavy and wouldnt go under bridges says beardsall we had to strip them back to the core and now were working to reassemble them on site cutting down to the core each transformer consists of two main components a core made of iron and two windings made of copper the transformer itself has no moving parts when a voltage is applied to one of the transformer windings the primary winding a magnetic field is created in the iron core this field then induces a voltage into the other winding the secondary winding depending on the number of coils on each set of windings the output voltage will increase or decrease more coils on the secondary winding steps the voltage up fewer coils on the secondary steps the voltage down this entire apparatus is submerged in an oil to provide insulation and keep the transformer cool meaning the first step was to drain 50000 litres of oil from each transformer this was then sent to a refinery to be processed cleaned and stored until the transformers are reassembled at cruachan oil removed the drax engineers oversaw and managed the dismantling of the transformers at longannet once the transformers were stripped down to a state suitable for movement they were loaded up onebyone for transportation meanwhile at cruachan engineers worked on construction of a purpose built bunded area for storage of the transformers the transformers were destined to be stored on land outside the main admin buildings adjacent to loch awe loch awe at cruachan power station the loch itself is a beautiful place with abundant animal and birdlife  and a fish farm is located almost directly opposite the power station in the event of a transformer leaking the natural environment must be protected an oiltight storage area was therefore built to ensure that no oil would end up in the loch the road to cruachan rather than heaving each of the transformers onto a trailer each one was raised using hydraulic jacking equipment a trailer was then driven underneath and the transformer lowered onto it the trailer is specifically designed to take the transformers and fit certain dimensions explains beardsall it has 96 wheels over 12 sets of axles each of which can be turned individually to assist in navigating around tight spots the trailers are towed by large tractor units each weighing over 40 tonnes these provided the motive power to move the transformers each was moved in two stages over the space of two weeks the first transformer over the course of a weekend the second in the middle of the night some 10 days later when we could go was governed by the police and highways agencies as they need to close the roads says beardsall we set off from longannet at 7pm on the friday evening and moved them 60 miles along the route to a layby where we stored them that leg took approximately five hours then the second leg was the last 25 miles to cruachan carried out on the sunday morning of the same weekend navigating the highlands with 115 tonnes of hugely valuable equipment is where the real challenge came in hills dips and tight turns made for slow progress the original generator transformer at cruachan power station the average speed was about 10mph but were going through the highlands so it was quite a bit slower than that in some places we occasionally hit 20 mph at points but that was definitely for the minority of the time says beardsall some of the roads were so narrow it was difficult to get two cars past each other the contractors also had to put metal plating over bridges because they werent strong enough to take the load having safely arrived at cruachan the transformers are being stored at surface level until they are needed at which time they will be taken down the halfamilelong tunnel into the energy storage station typically a transformer has a design life of 25 years although they can last longer explains beardsall there are four units at cruachan and the transformers for two of these units have already been replaced so these transformers would be used to replace the existing transformer for the two remaining units should it ever be needed the existing transformer having been in operation since 1965  moving heavy objects is part and parcel of running draxs multiple power stations around the country however navigating the highlands the very terrain

 technology a brief history of scottish hydropower 1 october 2019 power generation over the last century scottish hydro power has played a major part in the countrys energy make up while today it might trail behind wind solar and biomass as a source of renewable electricity in great britain it played a vital role in connecting vast swathes of rural scotland to the power grid  some of which had no electricity as late as the 1960s and all by making use of two plentiful scottish resources water and mountains but the road to hydro adoption has been varied and difficult travelled on by brave deathdefying construction workers ingenious engineers and the inspirational leadership of a scottish politician to trace where the history of scottish hydropower began we need to go back to the end of the 19 th century and to the banks of loch ness loch ness scottish highlands from abbeys to aluminium it was on the shores of loch ness that one of the first known hydroelectric schemes was built at the fort augustus benedictine abbey the scheme provided power to the monks living there as well as 800 village residents  though legend has it that their lights went dim every time the monks played their organ however it was the british aluminium company formed in 1894 that first realised the huge potential of scotlands steep mountains lochs and reliably heavy rainfall to generate substantial amounts of hydro power in need of a reliable source of electricity to help turn raw bauxite into aluminium the firm established a hydroelectric plant and smelting works at foyers and loch ness several similar schemes to support the aluminium industry soon appeared around the country but it took another 20 years for the first major hydropower project to supply electricity to the public to emerge in 1926 the clyde valley electrical power co opened the lanark hydro electric scheme  which used energy from the river clydes flow to create power now owned by drax it still has a generation capacity of 17 mw  enough to supply more than 15000 homes  river clyde lanark it was quickly followed by power stations at rannoch and tummel in the grampian mountains and in 1935 by what became a highly influential scheme in the history of scottish hydro power at galloway drawing enough energy from local rivers to support five generating power stations the project was the largest runoftheriver scheme ever created architecturally it also set the tone for later projects with stylised dams and modernist turbine halls a fairer share of power for the highlands the galloway scheme supplied energy to a wide area too including parts of the central highlands scottish labour mp tom johnston a staunch socialist and scottish patriot saw how this new power source could provide massive benefits to northern communities in the early 1940s only an estimated one in six scottish farms and one in a hundred small land crofts had electricity in 1941 johnston became scotlands minister for state with a vision as he put it to create largescale reforms that might mean scotia resurgent expanding hydro power was a priority tom johnston mp two years later he formed the north of scotland hydroelectric board nsheb its aim was to create several new schemes including at tummel and loch sloy that would supply the national grid and bring electricity to more rural scottish areas the projects were met with fierce opposition from landowners and local pressure groups who feared new dams and power stations would ruin the countryside and bring unwelcome industrialisation public enquiries followed but the boards promises that the developments would be sensitive to the environment and bring cheap electricity in areas such as the isle of skye and loch ewe eventually won the day thousands of local men as well as german and italian former prisoners of war  were drafted in to work on the projects among the most courageous were workers known as tunnel tigers who blasted away rock using handheld drills and gelignite to create water channels and underground chambers including at draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro station  deaths caused by everything from blast injuries to fires were common the men also had to cope with incessant rain and cold and were housed in bleak militarystyle camps with little to do in their spare time besides drink fights would break out regularly but the financial rewards were enormous with wages up to ten times higher than labourers employed on highland estates could expect glenlee penstocks the future takes shape the boards first small projects were completed in 1948 at morar and nostie bridge supplying electricity to areas including parts of wester ross catherine mackenzie a local widow performed the morar opening ceremony reportedly declaring let light and power come to the crofts bigger schemes were plagued by problems conveyor belts had to be built to transport stone across 175 miles of moor during construction at sloy for instance and there were frequent stone and timber shortages but sloy eventually opened in 1950 the largest conventional hydro electrical power station in great britain with an installed capacity of 128 mw it would be followed by major schemes at glen affric and loch shin by the mid sixties the board had built 54 main power stations and 78 dams northern scotland was now 90 connected to the national grid hydro board shops began popping up on high streets selling appliances and collecting bill payments tom johnston died in 1965 aged 83 the provost of inverness declared no words can say how grateful we are loch awe beside cruachan power station that same year the worlds then largest reversible pumped storage power station opened at cruachan during times of low electricity demand its turbines pump water from loch awe to

revolutionise the world of energy and communications 30 august 2019 electrification what should be made of the 5g gap its the difference between what some commentators are expecting to happen thanks to this new technology and what others perhaps more realistically believe is possible in the near future what we call 5g is the fifth generation of mobile communications following 4g 3g etc it promises vastly increased data download and upload speeds much improved coverage along with better connectivity this will bring with it lower latency  potentially as low as one millisecond a 90 per cent reduction on the equivalent time for 4g  and great news for traders and gamers along with lower unit costs trading desk at haven power ipswich the latest estimates predict that 5g will have an economic impact of 12 trillion by 2035 as mobile technology changes away from connecting people to other people and information and towards connecting us to everything  some experts believe the effects of 5g will be enormous and almost instantaneous transforming the way we live it will have a huge effect on the internet of things  for instance making it possible for us to live in a more instant much more connected world with more interactions with smart objects every day driverless cars that talk to the road and virtual and augmented reality to help us as we go could become part of our everyday lives  others see 5g as a revolution that will begin almost immediately but which could take many years to materialise  the principal reason for this is the sheer level of investment required the frequencies being used to carry the signal from the proposed 5g devices can provide an enormous amount of bandwidth and carry unimaginable amounts of data at incredible speeds but they cannot carry it very far and the volume of devices connected to this network will be enormous the bbc estimates that between 50 and 100 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2020  more than 12 for every single person on earth so in order to support the huge increase in connectivity that is anticipated a reality there will be a need for a comparably large increase in the number of base stations  with as many as 500000 more estimated to be needed in the uk alone thats around three times as many base stations as required for 4g to carry the amount of data anticipated without catastrophic losses in signal quality will require the stations to be no more than 500m apart while that may be technically possible in cities it will only happen as a result of huge amounts of investment and what will happen in the countryside with its lower population density it seems doubtful in the extreme that any corporation will regard it as a potentially profitable business decision to build a network of base stations half a kilometre apart in areas where few of their customers live and thats without taking into account the town and country planning system or the views of residents who may not welcome new base stations near their homes until this year the only two workable examples of functional 5g networks are one built by samsung in seoul south korea and another by huawei in moscow in advance of the 2020 football world cup although the first uk mobile networks have now begun to offer the new communications standard 5g is still clearly a long way from being able to deliver on its potential what will 5g mean for the world of energy a report from accenture contains a number of predictions about how 5g may change the energy world by helping to increase energy efficiency overall and accelerating the development of the smart grid 5g uses less power than previous generations of wireless technology this means that less energy will be used for each individual connection which will take less time to complete than with 4g devices thereby saving energy and ultimately money too it is important to remember that even though such savings will be significant they will need to be offset against the huge global increase in communications through 5gconnected devices accelerating the smart grid to improve forecasting 5g has the potential to help us manage energy generation and transmission more efficiently and therefore more costeffectively the reports authors anticipate that by allowing many unconnected energyconsuming devices to be integrated into the grid through lowcost 5g connections 5g enables these devices to be more accurately monitored to support better forecasting of energy needs improve demand side management and reduce costs by connecting these energyconsuming devices using a smart grid demandside management will be further enhanced to support load balancing helping reduce electricity peaks and ultimately energy costs manage energy infrastructure more efficiently and reduce downtime by sharing data about energy use through 5g connections the new technology can help ensure that spending on energy infrastructure is managed more efficiently based on data in order to reduce the amount of downtime and in the event of any failure smart grid technology connected by 5g will be able to provide an instant diagnosis  right to the level of which pylon or transmitter is the cause of an outage  making it easier to remedy the situation and get the grid up and running again 5g could even help turn street lighting off at times when there are no pedestrians or vehicles in the area again reducing energy use carbon emissions and costs accenture estimate that in the us alone this technology has the potential to save as much as 1 billion every year more data more power although 5g devices themselves may demand less power than the telecoms technology it they will eventually replace that doesnt tell the whole story more connected devices with more data flowing between them relies on more data centres this has led some data centres to sign power purchase agreements to both reduce the cost of their insatiable desire for electricity and also ensure its provenance data centre as well as data centres the more numerous base stations needed for 5g will consume a lot of power one global mobile network provider says just to operate its existing base stations leads to a 650m electricity bill annually accounting for 65 of its overall power consumption base station tower contrary to the findings of the accenture report a recent estimate has put the power requirement of an individual 5g base station at three times that of a 4g keeping in mind that three of these are needed for every existing base station the analysis by zhengmao li of china mobile suggests a ninefold increase in electricity consumption just for that key part of a 5g network with the great britain power system decarbonising at a rapid pace the additional power required to electrify the economy with new technologies shouldnt have a negative environmental impact  at least when it comes to energy generation however as we use evermore powerful and numerous devices we need to ensure our power system has the flexibility to deliver electricity whatever the weather conditions this means a smarter grid with more backup power in the form of spinning turbines and storage tags technology  decarbonisation  energy storage  electric vehicles evs in energy storage timing is everything 21 august 2019 power generation electricity is unlike any other resource the amount being generated must exactly match demand for it around the clock managing this delicate balancing act is the job of the national grid electricity system operator eso which works constantly to ensure supply meets demand and the grid remains balanced  one of the ways it does this is by storing energy when there is too much and deploying it when there is too little although there are many different ways of storing energy at a small scale at grid level it becomes more difficult one of the few ways it is currently possible is through pumped hydro storage cruachan power station in the highlands of scotland is one of four pumped storage facilities in great britain it uses electricallydriven turbines to pump water up a mountain into a reservoir when there is excess electricity on the grid and then releases the water stored in the reservoir back down to spin the same turbines to generate power when its needed quickly the dual capabilities of these turbines are unique to pumped hydro storage and contribute to the overall grids stability however what dictates when cruachans turbines switch from pump to generate and vice versa is all a matter of what the grid needs  and when the switch from pump to generate while the machine hall of cruachan power station is an aweinspiring place for its size and location 396 metres beneath ben cruachan it generates electricity much like any other hydropower station harnessing the flow of water to rotate any number of its four 100 megawatt mw turbines this mode  simply called generate mode  is usually employed during periods of peak power demand such as mornings and evenings during a major national televised event  or when wind and solar energy output drops below forecast as a result starting up and generating millions of watts of electricity has to be fast it takes just two minutes for a turbine to run up from rest to generate mode says martin mcghie operations and maintenance manager at the power station it takes slightly longer for the turbines to run down from generate to rest but whatever function the turbines are performing they can reach it within a matter of minutes the reverse of generate mode is pump mode which changes the direction of travel for the water this time using electricity from the grid to pump water from the vast loch awe at the foot of ben cruachan to the upper reservoir where it waits ready to be released in contrast to generate mode pump mode typically comes into play at times when demand is low and there is too much power on the system such as during nights or at weekends when there is excessive wind generation  however the grid has evolved since cruachan first began generating in 1965 and this has changed when it and how it operates in the early days cruachan was used in a rather predictable way pumping overnight to absorb excess generation from coal and nuclear plants and generating during daytime peak periods says martin the move to more renewable energy sources like wind mean overall power generation is more unpredictable he continues there has also been a move from cruachan being primarily an energy storage plant to one which can also offer a range of ancillary services to the grid system operator the benefits of spin mode in between pumping water and generating power cruachans turbines can also spin in air while connected to the grid neither pumping not generating this is essentially a standby mode where the turbines are ready to either quickly switch into generation or pumping at a moments notice they spin one way for spin pump the other for spin generate these spin modes are requested by the eso to ensure reserve energy is available to respond rapidly to changes on the grid system in spin generate mode the generator is connected up to the grid but the water is ejected from the space around the turbine by injecting compressed air the turbine does not generate power but is kept spinning allowing it to quickly start up again as soon as the grid has an urgent need for power the air is released and the water from the upper reservoir flows into the turbine to begin generation in under 30 seconds spin pump works on the same basis as spin generate but with the turbine rotating in the opposite direction ready to pump at short notice this allows cruachan to absorb excess generation and balance the system as soon as the eso needs it the use of spin mode by the eso is highly variable and dependant on a number of factors eg weather conditions or the state of the grid system at the time says martin this unpredictability of the increasingly intermittent electricity system makes the flexibility of cruachans multiple turbines all the more important ready for the future grid its not only the types of electricity generation around the system that are changing how cruachan operates martin suggests that the way energy traders and the eso use cruachan will continue to evolve as the market requirements and opportunities change technology is also changing the market and martin predicts this could affect what cruachan does in the future we will face competition from alternative storage technologies such as batteries electric vehicles  as well as competition for the other ancillary services we offer however cruachans flexibility to generate absorb or spin in readiness means it is prepared to adjust to any future changes cruachan is always ready to modify or upgrade to meet requirements as we have done in the past says martin the priority is always to be able to deliver the services required by the grid system operator  in characteristic quick time visit cruachan  the hollow mountain to take the power station tour  read our series on the lesserknown electricity markets

is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags

do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it
