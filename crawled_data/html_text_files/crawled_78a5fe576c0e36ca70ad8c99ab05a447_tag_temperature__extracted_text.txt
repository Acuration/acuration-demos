temperature how the heatwave affects electricity demand iain staffell imperial college london 27 july 2018 opinion 165 degrees is the goldilocks temperature for the brits  not hot enough for aircon not too cold to put the heating on in march we saw how the beast from the east caused a surge in demand now the long summer heatwave is doing the same june 23 rd marked the start of the heatwave with daytime temperatures surpassing 30c in scotland and wales the last week of june was 33c warmer than the previous week and demand was 860 mw higher see chart below  this rise is equivalent to power demand from an extra 25 million households this reflects the growing role of air conditioning and refrigeration in shops and cooling for data centres global electricity demand from cooling is rising dramatically and is seen as a  blind spot  in the global energy system this will become more important as global temperatures and more importantly global incomes rise however it is easier to deal with than cold spells during winter because demand is low and solar pv output is high below 14c demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it gets colder as buildings need more heating around a tenth of british homes have electric heating as do half of commercial and public buildings  and while the uk is not synonymous with air conditioners demand rises by 350 mw for each degree that temperature rises above 20c this effect may well grow stronger in the coming years national grid expect that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade perhaps events such as the current prolonged heatwave may spur more households to invest in air conditioning read the press release explore power grid data during the heatwave beginning 23 rd june commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags technology  electric insights  investors  temperature what hot weather means for electricity 29 august 2017 power generation during the penultimate week of june 2017 temperatures of thirty degrees celsius or more were recorded across the uk for five days straight it was the hottest continuous spell of weather in the country since the 70s and while this may sound like a minor headline its evidence of an important fact the world is getting warmer  according to the met office experiencing a very hot summer is now likely to occur every five years rather than every 50 by the 2040s more extreme heatwaves could become commonplace  and this could have serious consequences the extreme heatwave that hit europe in 2003 led to a death toll in the tens of thousands and placed extreme strain on the continent  not only on its people but on its infrastructure too if this weather is set to continue what does it mean for our electricity network electricity in extreme weather in hot countries electricity use soars in times of extreme weather due to increased use of cooling devices like air conditioning one us study predicted an extreme temperature upswing could drive as much as an 72 increase in us peak demand in northern europe including the uk where air conditioning is less prevalent  the effects of heat arent as pronounced but that could change in france hot weather is estimated to have contributed to a 2 gw increase in demand this june the uk which has traditionally only seen demand swings due to cold weather  is also beginning to feel the effects of extreme heat according to dr iain staffell of imperial college london for every degree rise in temperature during june 2017 electricity demand rose by 09 300 mw for example on 19 th june when temperature averaged 219 degrees celsius demand reached 32 gw on the 25 th  when temperatures dropped to an average of 159 degrees demand shrank to 266 gw in the very hottest days of summer this can mean the grid needs to deliver an additional 15 gw of power  equivalent to the output of five rapidresponse gas power stations or twoandahalf biomass units at drax power station and while heats effect on demand is considerable its not the only one it has on electricity the problem of cooling water in hot weather generating power doesnt just need fuel its also a waterintensive process power stations consume water for two main reasons to turn into steam to drive generation turbines and to cool down machinery both rely on raising the temperature of the water however this water cant simply be released back into a river or lake after use  even if nothing has been added to it  as warm water can negatively affect wildlife living in these habitats first it has to be cooled  normally via cooling towers  but in hot weather this takes longer and as a result power production becomes less efficient and in some cases plant output must be dialled back this had serious consequences for frances nuclear power plants during the 2003 heatwave these plants  which provide roughly 75 of the countrys electricity  draw water from nearby rivers to cool their reactors during the heatwave however these rivers were both too hot and too low to safely provide water for the cooling process which in turn led to the power stations having to either close or drastically reduce capacity coupled with increased demand france was left on the verge of a largescale black out situations like this are even more critical when considering heats effects on electricitys motorway the national grid how the hot weather impacts electricity when materials get hot they expand  this includes those electricity grids are made from for example overhead power transmission cables are often clad in aluminium which is particularly susceptible to expansion in heat when it expands overhead lines can slacken and sag which increases electrical resistance in the cables  leading to a drop in efficiency transformers which step up and down voltage across grids are also susceptible they give off heat as a byproduct of their operations but to keep them within a safe level of operation they have whats known as a power rating  the highest temperature at which they can safely function when ambient temperatures rise this ceiling gets lower and their efficiency drops  about 1 for every one degree celsius gain in temperature at scale this can have a significant effect overall grids can lose about 1 in efficiency for every three degrees hotter it gets as global temperatures continue to rise these challenges could grow more acute at uk power stations such as drax important upgrade and maintenance work takes place during the quieter summer months if this period becomes one in which there is a higher demand for power at peak times it could lead to new challenges investing in infrastructure and building a power generation landscape that includes a mix of technologies and meets a variety of grid needs is one way in which we can counter the challenges of climate change this will mean we can not only move towards a lower carbon economy and contribute towards slowing global warming but respond to climate change by adapting
