target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate agreement beccs has the potential to play a vital role in power generation creating a hydrogen economy and
