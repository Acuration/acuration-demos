landmark moments on the path to a net zero uk landmark moments on the path to a net zero uk work is underway for great britain to achieve a worldfirst in yorkshire and the humber writes drax ceo will gardiner will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 10 june 2021 opinion in brief 75m backing for zero carbon humber to develop net zero technologies accenture and world economic forum report says humber could decarbonise quicker than any other uk industrial region mitsubishi heavy industries partners with drax supplying its advanced carbon capture technology making millions of tonnes of negative emissions possible at drax power station this decade deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs in the 2020s will have positive spillover for a net zero economy says frontier economics delaying beccs until the 2030s argues baringa research could increase energy system costs by 45bn planning consent process for beccs at drax from 2027 is underway with public consulted drax and bechtel studying global beccs deployments around the world governments industries and societies have begun to set themselves targets for reaching net zero but it is at home in the uk where real progress is starting to be made in answering some of the tougher challenges posed by the global environmental crisis eyebrows were raised when the uk set itself one of the most stretching timeframes in which to decarbonise but like many business leaders i am firmly of the belief that this ambitious target will be the catalyst to deliver the innovative thinking needed to get the planet to where it needs to be i was delighted to learn recently that government has awarded the zero carbon humber partnership 75 million in funding to develop worldleading net zero technologies mhi beccs pilot plant within ccus incubation area drax power station north yorkshire drax was one of the founder members of the partnership and its goal is to build the worlds first net zero industrial cluster and decarbonise the north of england along with the other members we worked hard to secure this government support and it consists of money from the department for business energy  industrial strategys industrial decarbonisation challenge fund with two thirds coming from private backing this financing is a vote of confidence from investors and highlights the governments commitment to developing the worlds first zerocarbon industrial cluster in the region projects of this scale backed with meaningful funding are key to accelerating a range of technologies that will be essential to advancing decarbonisation these include hydrogen production carbon capture usage and storage ccus and negative emissions through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs but more than just having a positive effect on reducing emissions delivering this in the humber will also support clean economic growth and futureproof vital industries biomass storage domes and water cooling towers at drax power station in north yorkshire i believe that in a similar way to how renewables have made huge strides in helping decarbonise power a range of new technologies are now needed to decarbonise industry and industrial regions our work as a partnership in the humber is establishing a landmark project for the uk and the worlds journey to net zero and clean growth reaching net zero depends on a diverse range of technologies there are many factors that will be essential for the world to reach net zero  but perhaps none more important than open collaboration and integration government industry and individual businesses will need to work together and share learnings and infrastructure to be able to make true progress this collaboration will of course take many forms but one that is crucially important is industrial clusters such as zero carbon humber and neighbouring net zero teesside a recent report by accenture highlighted how vital decarbonising industrial regions will be to reaching climate goals industrial carbon dioxide co 2  emissions account for as much as 11 gigatonnes or 30 of global greenhouse gas emissions ghg however the report also highlights the opportunities both environmental and economic in decarbonising clusters the market for global industrial efficiency alone is expected to receive investments worth as much as 40bn while the global hydrogen market was estimated at around 175bn in 2019 the humber is the uks largest cluster by industrial emissions emitting 10 million tonnes of co 2 per year  more than 2 of the uks total ghg emissions pioneering projects around hydrogen production ccus and negative emissions through beccs are all ready to scale in the region beginning the task of reducing and removing emissions the potential benefit to the regional economy could also be significant  its estimated these technologies could create 48000 direct indirect and induced jobs in the humber region by 2027 this new 75 million in funding will allow work to gather pace on these transformational projects the funding will be used to obtain land rights and begin frontend engineering design feed for the hydrogen facility at h2h saltend as well as onshore pipeline infrastructure for co 2 and hydrogen it marks the beginning of the vital work of putting transportation systems in place that will take captured co 2 from drax power stations beccs generating units and permanently store it under the southern north seas bed draxs beccs power generation is one of zero carbon humbers anchor projects our recently confirmed partnership with mitsubishi heavy industries mhi will see its advanced km cdr carbon capture technology deployed at drax power station the negative emissions that this longterm agreement will make possible will enable the region to reduce its emissions faster than any other uk cluster according to accenture  developing negative emissions through beccs will help us achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 by that time drax power station could remove 8 million tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere each year playing a major part in helping the uk meet its climate goals from beccs to a net zero uk in march 2021 drax kickstarted the process to gain the necessary planning permissions called a development consent order dco from the government  its a crucial administrative step towards delivering a beccs unit as early as 2027 and a landmark moment in developing negative emissions in the uk a report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary step on the uks path to decarbonisation developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would also have positive spillover effects that can contribute to wider decarbonisation and a net zero economy these include learnings and efficiencies that come from developing and operating the countrys first beccs power station as well as transport and storage infrastructure which will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects however the benefits of acting quickly and pioneering beccs deployment at scale can only be achieved if policy is put in place to enable the right business models for beccs and negative emissions according to the frontier report intervention is needed to instil confidence in investors while also protecting consumer energy prices from spikes inside mhi pilot carbon capture plant drax power station failure to implement negative emissions through beccs could also be costly time is of the essence for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 and research by energy consultancy baringa  commissioned by drax highlights the economic cost of hesitation findings showed that delaying beccs from 2027 to 2030 could increase energy system costs by more than 45bn over the coming decade and over 5bn by the time the uk has to reach net zero i believe what we are developing at drax can become a worldleading and exportable solution for largescale carbon negative power generation the potential in negative emissions is economic as well as environmental protecting thousands of jobs in the uks carbonintensive industries as well as overseas beccs offers great potential for the uk to export skills knowledge and equipment to an international market to help establish this market we are working with engineering and construction project management firm bechtel to explore locations globally where there is the opportunity to deploy beccs and identify how newbuild beccs plants can be optimised to deliver negative emissions for those regions pictured lr kentaro hosomi chief regional officer emea mitsubishi heavy industries mhi jenny blyth project analyst drax group at drax power station north yorkshire carl clayton head of beccs drax group multiple government and independent organisations have highlighted how essential negative emissions are to reaching net zero in the uk as well as global climate goals the recently formed coalition for negative emissions aims to advance this vital industry at a global scale by uniting a range of negative emissions providers and users from across industries we can make it a more powerful force for decarbonisation and sustainable growth it will still be a long journey towards the uks goals but the governments funding for zero carbon humber the beginning of our beccs dco and partnerships with mhi and bechtel are key
