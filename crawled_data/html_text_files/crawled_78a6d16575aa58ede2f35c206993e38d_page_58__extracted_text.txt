sustainable affordable biomass haven power the specialist electricity supplier to uk businesses and part of drax group plc has signed a deal with thames water to supply their electricity requirements in a deal worth more than 500m over five years there is an option for two further fiveyear renewals which could increase the overall value of the contract to more than 15bn over 15 years haven power is the uks largest independent electricity supplier to businesses and sources its power from the drax power plant in selby yorkshire which as a result of its world leading biomass transformation is now the uks single largest supplier of renewable energy the deal will enable thames water which already sources about 20 of its electricity through selfgenerated renewables such as solar wind hydro and biogas to meet all of its electricity needs from renewables drax group chief executive dorothy thompson said im delighted that drax and haven will play such an important part in helping to deliver thames renewable objectives as the uk looks to decarbonise in an affordable and pragmatic way it is pioneering companies like thames that are leading the way thames water energy manager angus berry said our energy and carbon strategy centres around reducing costs for customers and minimising our impact on the environment this deal with haven puts downward pressure on bills and means we will now be using 100 renewable electricity we look forward to growing our relationship with haven to exploit further opportunities to minimise energy costs and emissions as well as continuing to work towards our ambitious target of selfgenerating 30 of our own electricity by 2020 drax is undergoing a major transformation programme to convert its 4gw power station  which supplies around 8 of the uks power  from coal to sustainable biomass two out of six units have now been converted and plans are advanced to modify a third unit to highbiomass later this year the estimated 12 million tonnes of carbon saved once three units are fully converted is equivalent to taking 10 of the uks total vehicle fleet off the roads and makes drax the single largest decarbonisation project currently underway in europe ends notes to editors about thames water thames water which serves london and the thames valley is britains biggest water and sewerage company topquality drinking water  we supply more than a

watt powers progress power project near eye concluded in january 2015 and is currently under consideration by the planning inspectorate in accordance with the statutory dco timetable a decision as to whether or not to grant development consent orders to the project is expected from the secretary of state for energy and climate change in midjuly 2015 assuming the dco is granted to the project it is watt powers intention to enter the progress power project in the uks capacity market auction subject to the outcome of the auction and the projects financing watt power would expect the plants to commence construction within 12 months of the auction with commercial operation approximately 18 months later submission of dco application deferred 30 march 2015 press releases the project is in a

millbrook power shares final plans with local councils 9 february 2015 press releases millbrook power mpl has made one significant change to the project since it last met the local authorities in november mpl has chosen to underground the electrical cable connection for its power project thereby avoiding the need to construct new overhead lines and new transmission towers the decision to go underground the gas pipeline connection will also be underground will significantly reduce the visual impact of the project and has been taken after careful consideration of the views held by local councillors and local people and mpls completion of its technical and environmental studies that have been carried out over the past 12 months nick johnson mpls project manager said the local councillors welcomed our decision to go underground with the electrical connection this follows our decision last year to reduce the height of the power station stacks after considering the results of technical studies the councillors also acknowledged the measures that we will take to minimise other impacts of the power project our project is situated on land allocated for development but we have always been mindful of the views of local people and fully appreciate the local environment and the heritage of the area jason longhurst director of regeneration at central bedfordshire council said it has been very useful to have been engaged early in this important development and were pleased that millbrook power has provided changes to reduce the visual impact of the development millbrook power intends to submit its application to the planning inspectorate before the end of march and there should then follow a six month period of examination during which time the local councils and other interested parties can express their views subject to the outcome of the planning inspectorates examination process and the secretary of state for energy  climate change granting a development consent order the millbrook power project could enter commercial operation in 20192020 notes to editors the underground electrical connection will export the electricity that is generated by the power plant via a new substation into the national grid the underground gas pipeline will deliver natural gas the power stations only fuel source from the uk national gas transmission system to the power generation plant the 200m mpl project was first announced in may 2014 since then mpls technical and environmental studies have considered a range of issues such as noise air quality visual impact ecology and transport in addition mpl has publicised its plans via various channels consulted the local councils in the area and a range of other interested parties and held two series of public exhibitions subject to planning and financing construction of the project could start in 20172018 for a 23 year period the plant up to 299mw capacity will only run at times when electricity demand is at its highest mainly during the winter months and on those occasions when there is intermittent output from renewable sources of energy primarily wind and solar the project would be a substantial and longterm investment in the area seeing the creation of around 150 construction jobs up to 15 permanent skilled jobs and potential business opportunities for local companies mpl is consulting central bedfordshire and bedford borough councils on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits to the surrounding area for further information please visit
