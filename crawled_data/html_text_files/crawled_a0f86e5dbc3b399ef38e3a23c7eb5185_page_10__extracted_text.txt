generation for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve

power generation from roman mines to the fuel behind the continentwide industrial revolution europe has a long history with coal  but with reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions now firmly on the global agenda europes love for coal is rapidly declining collectively the eu aims for renewable sources to account for 20 of gross final energy consumption by 2020 and 27 by 2030  countries in

increased capacity in wind and solar generation but also by other lowcarbon energy sources enabling countries to kick their coal habits aiming for 100 renewable as myth after myth is dispelled about renewables  there are countries proving it is possible to power a modern developed nation entirely through renewable energy sources up in the northernmost reaches of europe iceland already generates all its electricity from renewable sources this is split between 75 hydropower and 25 geothermal power  geothermal not only offers a renewable source of electricity but also hot water for heating the volcanic island nation a geothermal power station steams on a cold day in iceland hydropower is also a key contributor to norways renewable ambitions with more than 31 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower capacity norway is able to rely on it as a source of electricity and export its plentiful oil and natural gas reserves to countries still dependent on fossil fuels many parts of europe are well suited to hydropower with reliable rainfall and the mountainous topography necessary to construct dams and power stations parts of austria romania and georgia also make substantial use of hydropower as a source of electricity artificial lake behind the bicaz dam at sunset romania for countries without this access to largescale hydropower its the increased installation of renewables that holds the key to eliminating the need for coal growing renewable generation last year saw electricity generation from renewable sources overtake that from coal for the first time thanks to continuous expansion of wind solar and biomass capacity around the continent between 2010 and 2017 generation from wind solar and biomass installations in eu countries more than doubled from 302 terawatt hours twh to 670 twh according to eurostat  driven primarily by an increase in wind capacity as a source of renewable electricity wind has already proved capable of generating major portions of a countrys demand managing to meet 44 of denmarks overall demand in 2017  this was after previously producing a 40 electricity surplus one day for the country  allowing it to export the emissionfree electricity to neighbours wind turbines on the east coast of sweden across the eu generation from wind more than doubled from 150 twh to 364 twh from 2010 to last year while solar generation grew five times from 23 twh to 119 twh and biomass jumped from 129 twh to 196 twh by contrast coal and lignite fell from 818 twh to 669 twh these renewable electricity sources along with hydropower now account for 30 of eu countries collective electricity generation and while coal generation continues to drop other low carbon energy sources particularly nuclear still play essential roles in many european energy systems from coal to low carbon sweden is one of the leaders in renewable electricity generation setting 2040 as the date to move to totally renewable energy however while it currently counts 65 gw of wind capacity installed and has already exceeded its 2020 renewable generation goals  the countrys 10 nuclear reactors still make up 40 of its electricity output  sweden aims to phasenuclear out of its energy mix but this will force it to import more power from neighbours to meet demand  france is even more dependent with nuclear making up 75 of its electricity production and earning more than 3 billion a year for the country in exports it aims to reduce its nuclear generation to 50 with president emmanuel macron claiming continued nuclear generation offers  the most carbonfree way to produce electricity with renewables  fessenheim nuclear and hydroelectric power plants in alsace france as a reliable and lowcarbon source of electricity the most modern nuclear power stations add a certain amount of flexibility to grids enabling greater adoption of intermittent renewable sources across the eu nuclear made up a quarter of electricity generation in 2017  gas in the transition much more flexible than nuclear gas plays an essential role in many countries it accounted for 19 of electricity generation in the eu last year and produces around half the co 2 and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal  gas turbines can begin generating electricity at full power in just 30 minutes from a cold start  or 10 minutes from warm standby allowing it to plug any gaps in demand left by intermittent renewables its ability to provide many system services such as reserve power and frequency response will see it play an important transition role over the coming decades until cleaner technologies are able to take over artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission coal is not gone yet making up 11 of eus

improving performance and reducing the cost experts predict that by 2050 90 of newbuild cars will be powered by electricity  however its not only roads where transport is decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50 should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels although the deal fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the european union to environmental ngos the imo did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out co 2 emissions entirely as paris agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom businesses around the world are innovating small fleets of batterypowered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in norway belgium and the netherlands are preparing to set sail  including some able to run autonomously without a crew  dutch company portliner is also gearing up to launch the first fullyelectric emissionfree barges in europe dubbed tesla ships portliner chief executive officer ton van meegen claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbonneutral batteries  the first six barges alone are expected to remove 23000 trucks from the roads annually in the netherlands replacing them with zeroemission methods of transport china also recently launched an electric cargo ship to haul coal which whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 25 of global greenhouse emissions that result from the maritime transport industry once a farflung fantasy in some areas electrified

the uk is undergoing an energy revolution  a transition to a lowcarbon economy requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy through our flexible lower carbon electricity proposition and business to business b2b energy solutions the group is positioning itself for growth in this environment more details can be seen on page 4 of our annual report  our strategy our purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used through addressing uk energy needs and those of our customers our strategy is designed to deliver growing earnings and cash flow alongside significant cash returns for shareholders our ambition is to grow our ebitda to over 425 million by 2025 with over a third of those earnings coming from pellet production and b2b energy supply to create a broader more balanced earnings profile we intend to pay a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders progression towards these targets is underpinned by safety sustainability operational excellence and expertise in our markets summary of 2017 we made significant progress during 2017 but were below our expectations on the challenging scorecard targets we set ourselves in pellet production and biomass availability the latter reflecting the significant incident we experienced on our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2017 which extended into january 2018 energy supply performed well with opus energy in line with plan and haven power exceeding its targets through a combination of this performance and the progress of our strategy we have delivered ebitda of 229 million significantly ahead of 2016 140 million and with each of our three businesses contributing positive ebitda for the first time the group scorecard is reported in full in the remuneration report  pp 81107 of our annual report  and the kpis are also shown below they reflect the diversity of our operations and our need to maintain clear focus on delivering operational excellence on a statutory basis we recorded a loss of 151 million which reflects unrealised losses on derivative contracts previously announced accounting policy on the accelerated depreciation on coalspecific assets as well as amortisation of newly acquired intangible assets in opus energy we also calculate underlying earnings a profit after tax of 27 million which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and to assess the performance of the group without the income statement volatility introduced by noncash fair value adjustments on our portfolio of forward commodity and currency futures contracts during the year we refinanced our existing debt facilities reducing our debt cost we also confirmed a new dividend policy which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend 50 million in respect of 2017 consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth at year end our net debt was 91 million below our 2x net debt to ebitda target providing additional headroom there is more detail on our financial performance in the group financial review on page 46 of our annual report  in the us our pellet production operations recorded yearonyear growth in output of 35 with our first two plants now producing at full capacity during the second half of 2017 we also completed the installation of additional capacity enabling our morehouse and amite facilities to handle a greater amount of residue material supporting efforts to produce good quality pellets at the lowest cost as part of our target to expand our biomass selfsupply capability we completed the acquisition of lasalle bioenergy lasalle adding pellet production capacity lasalle commenced commissioning in november 2017 and due to its close proximity to our existing us facilities once complete will provide further opportunities for supply chain optimisation as in 2016 we benefited from the flexibility of selfsupply this often overlooked attribute of our supply chain enables us to manage biomass supply across the power generation business planned outage season and to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the shortterm spot market in power generation we experienced a significant incident on our biomass rail unloading facilities including a small fire on a section of conveyor we fully investigated the incident and following repairs over the christmas period have now recommissioned the facility with enhanced operating procedures this is a timely reminder of the combustible nature of biomass and the need for strong controls and processes to protect our people and assets our biomass units continued to produce high levels of renewable electricity from sustainable wood pellets for the uk market  drax produced 15 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power sheffield leeds liverpool and manchester combined in doing so we are making a vital contribution to the uks ambitious targets for decarbonisation across electricity generation heating and transport  an 80 reduction by 2050 vs 1990 levels we benefited from the first year of operation of our third biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd scheme which provides an indexlinked price for the power produced until march 2027 the unit underwent a major planned outage between september and november with a full programme of works successfully completed the flexibility reliability and scale of our renewable generation alongside an attractive total system cost means we are strongly placed to play a longterm role in the uks energy mix to that end we continue to see longterm biomass generation as a key enabler allowing the uk government to meet its decarbonisation targets and the system operator to manage the grid the uk government recently confirmed support for further biomass generation at drax power station and we now plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  allowing us to provide even more renewable electricity whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer our heritage is coal but our future is flexible lowercarbon electricity we are making progress with the development of four new standalone ocgt plants situated in eastern england and wales and our work to develop options for coaltogas repowering with battery technologies  if these options would be supported by 15year capacity market contracts providing a clear investment signal and extending visibility of contractbased earnings out to the late 2030s in b2b energy supply we completed the acquisition of opus energy a supplier of electricity and gas to corporates and small businesses the transaction completed in february 2017 and opus energy has continued to operate successfully within the group achieving its targets and making an immediate and significant contribution to profitability alongside this good performance we have also implemented the operational steps necessary to realise further operational benefits of the acquisition and we now source all of opus power and gas internally haven power delivered a strong performance with the sale of large volumes of electricity to industrial customers through our customer focus and efficiencies margins have improved and the business generated a positive ebitda for the first time together our b2b energy supply business now has over 375000 customer meters making it the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk we are delivering innovative lowcarbon power solutions with 46 of our energy sold from renewable sources as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power we see this as a significant opportunity for the group in the medium to long term in october 2017 we completed the sale of billington bioenergy bbe to aggregated micro power holding amph consideration for the transaction was 23 million comprised of 16 million of shares in amph and 07 million of cash the sale of bbe is aligned with our strategy to focus on b2b energy supply however through our shareholding in amph we will retain an interest in the uk heating market whilst gaining exposure to the development of smallscale distributed energy assets political regulatory and economic background we continue to operate in a changing environment the full impact of the uks decision to leave the eu is still unknown the immediate impact on the group was a weakening of sterling and an associated increase in the cost of biomass which is generally denominated in other currencies through our utilisation of mediumterm foreign exchange hedges the group protected the cash impact of this weakness in 2017 sterling has generally strengthened and we have been able to extend our hedged position out to 2022 at rates close to those that we saw before brexit in terms of uk energy policy the governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts svt are not a common feature of the b2b market at the microbusiness end of this market which is closer in size to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are active in renewing contracts the uk governments response to its consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 has confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by october 2025 we believe our assets projects and ability to support our customers electricity management will support the governments ambition to maintain reliability when coal generation ceases running a resilient reliable grid is not simply about meeting the power demand on the system there are also system support services which are essential to its effective operation as the grid decentralises and becomes dependent on smaller distributed generation the number of plants able to provide these services is reducing biomass generation our proposed ocgts and our repowering project would allow us to meet these needs but this will not come for free a reliable flexible lowcarbon energy system will require the right longterm incentives in november 2017 the government confirmed that the uk will maintain a total carbon price the combined uk carbon price support  cps  and the european union emissions trading scheme  eu ets at around the current level cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing the level of carbon emissions in generation and we continue to support the pricing of carbon a view echoed in a report prepared for the uk government by the leading academic professor dieter helm against this backdrop we continue to make an important contribution to the uk economy according to a study published by oxford economics in 2016  draxs total economic impact  including our supply chain and the wages our employees and suppliers employees spend in the wider consumereconomy was 17 billion supporting 18500 jobs across the uk safety sustainability and people the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is vital to the group with safety at the centre of our operational philosophy we also recognise the growing need to support the wellbeing of our employees and their mental health during the year we continued to use total recordable injury rate trir as our primary kpi in this area performance was positive at 027 but we expect this to improve in the coming year the incident at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did not lead to physical injuries but was nonetheless a significant event and caused disruption into 2018 we consequently launched an incident investigation to ensure our personal and process safety management procedures are robust to promote greater awareness around wellbeing we have embedded this in our new people strategy and expect to focus more energy and resources on this important area during 2018 strong corporate governance is at the heart of the group  acting responsibly doing the right thing and being transparent as the group grows the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and recognising the importance of strong corporate governance  we have published a comprehensive overview of our sustainability progress in 2017 on our website  this also highlights future priorities to broaden our approach to sustainability and improved reporting of environment  social and governance esg performance we have also completed the process which allows us to participate in the un global compact ungc  an international framework which will guide our approach in the areas of human rights labour environment and anticorruption during 2017 we published our first statement on the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in compliance with the uk modern slavery act we have added modern slavery awareness to our programme of regular training for contract managers and reviewed our counterparty due diligence processes we have continued to maintain our rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability  ensuring the wood pellets we use are sustainable lowcarbon and fully compliant with the uks mandatory sustainability standards for biomass the biomass we use to generate electricity provides a 64 carbon emissions saving against gas inclusive of supply chain emissions our biomass lifecycle carbon emissions are 36g co 2  mj less than half the uk governments 79g co 2  mj limit our people are a key asset of the business through 2017 we developed a new people strategy the strategy focuses on driving performance and developing talent to deliver the groups objectives we have established groupwide practices including a career development and behaviour framework focused on performance and personal development research and innovation a key part of our strategy is to identify opportunities to improve existing operations and create options for longterm growth to that end we have established a dedicated research and innovation ri team led by the drax engineers who delivered our worldfirst biomass generation and supply chain solution we are actively looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our operations notably in our biomass supply chain biomass is our largest single cost and as such we are focused on greater supply chain efficiency and the extraction of value from a wide range of lowvalue residue materials in b2b energy supply we are using our engineering expertise to help offer our customers valueadding services and products which will improve efficiency and allow them to optimise their energy consumption in the following sections we review the performance of our businesses during the year performance review pellet production our pellets provide a sustainable lowcarbon fuel source  one that can be safely and efficiently delivered through our global supply chain and used by draxs power generation business to make renewable electricity for the uk our manufacturing operations also promote forest health by incentivising local landowners to actively manage and reinvest in their forests  operational review safety remains our primary concern and we have delivered yearonyear reduction in the level of recordable incidents output at our amite and morehouse pellet plants increased significantly although was below our target for the year we have remained focused on opportunities to improve efficiencies and capture cost savings as part of our drive to produce good quality pellets at the lowest possible cost we still have more work to do in this area to optimise quality and cost as our performance was below target for the year as part of our plans to optimise and improve operations we added 150k tonnes capacity at our existing plants bringing total installed capacity to 11 million tonnes and increasing the amount of lower cost sawmill residues we are able to process and used in our pellets  case study lowcost highimpact capacity increase byproducts of higher value wood industries such as sawdust from sawmills offer a lowcost source of residues for use in our pellet production process and during 2017 we added an additional 150k tonnes of capacity at our pellet plants to allow us to use more of this material by investing in giant hydraulic platforms known as truck dumps operators at amite and morehouse can unload a 50foot truck carrying either sawdust or wood chips and weighing 60 tonnes in less than two minutes increasing processing capacity reducing the cost of processing and increasing the use of lower cost residues find out more wwwdraxcomuktruckdumps and wwwdraxcomuksustainabilitysourcing at our baton rouge port facility greater volumes of production from our facilities drove higher levels of throughput with 17 vessels loaded and dispatched during the year 2016 11 vessels in april in line with our strategy to increase selfsupply we acquired a 450k tonne wood pellet plant  lasalle bioenergy lasalle commissioning of the plant began in november 2017 and we expect to increase production through 2018 lasalle is within a 200mile radius of our existing facilities by leveraging the locational benefits of these assets we aim to deliver further operational and financial efficiencies case study locational benefits of gulf cluster the location of our operations allows us to leverage benefits of multiple assets and locations for operational efficiencies all sites within 200mile radius operational efficiencies common plant and joint strategic spare parts maximise reliability

wood pellets produced and sold to the power generation business sales of pellets in the year ending 31 december 2017 totalled 136 million an increase of 84 over 2016 gross margin increased reflecting higher production volumes raw fibre procurement transportation and processing comprised the majority of cost of sales and as such this remains an important area of focus and an opportunity for the business through incremental investment in plant enhancements we expect to see further benefits from efficiencies and greater utilisation of lower cost residues total operating costs have increased reflecting an increase in operations at amite morehouse and the port of baton rouge alongside the addition of lasalle we acquired lasalle for 35 million and have invested an additional 27 million as

station remains the largest power station in the uk almost twice the size of the next largest during the year the station met 6 of the uks electricity needs whilst providing 15 of its renewable electricity alongside important system support services  with an increase in intermittent renewables and a reduction in the responsive thermal generation historically provided by coal  the system of the future will require capacity which is reliable flexible and able to respond quickly to changes in system demand and provide system support services these longterm needs inform our biomass

target to reduce 2050 carbon emissions by 80 versus 1990 levels across electricity generation heating and transport this reinforces the drax proposition  flexible reliable lowcarbon electricity in november the government updated its intentions regarding the future trajectory of uk carbon price support cps indicating that the total cost of carbon tax in the uk the total of cps and the eu emissions trading scheme would continue at around the current level  the tax is currently set at 18tonne  whilst coal remains on the system we believe that cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing carbon emissions from generation and that having an appropriate price for carbon emissions is the right way to provide a market signal to further reduce emissions in support of the uks longterm decarbonisation targets the uk government has now confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by 2025 we support this move subject to an appropriate alternative technology being in place with this in mind we have continued to develop options for our remaining coal assets to convert to biomass or gas to provide the reliable flexible capacity which we believe will be required to manage the increasingly volatile energy system of the future most recently with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply generation capacity and system support 2017 saw the first full year of operation of our biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd mechanism which provides indexlinked revenues for renewable electricity out to 2027 our other biomass units are supported by the renewable obligation certificate roc mechanism which similar to the cfd is also indexlinked to 2027 this acts as a premium above the price of power we sell from these units we sell power forward to the extent there is liquidity in the power markets which combined with our fuel hedging strategy provides longterm earnings and revenue visibility lower gas prices higher carbon costs and the continued penetration of intermittent renewables have kept wholesale electricity prices subdued with increasing levels of intermittent renewables we are continuing to see opportunities to extract value from flexibility  shortterm power and balancing market activity the provision of ancillary services and the value achieved from outofspecification fuels  to capture value in this market we continue to focus resource on optimising availability and flexibility of both coal and biomass units this whole process requires a high level of teamwork between the operational and commercial teams across the group to capture and protect value over the period 2017 to 2022 we expect to earn 90 million from a series of oneyear capacity market contracts for our coal units demonstrating that they still have a role to play the first of these contracts commenced in october 2017 adding 3 million to ebitda lastly we continue to source attractively priced fuel cargoes  outofspecification coals and distressed cargoes which help keep costs down for the business and consumers we do this for both coal and biomass this is a good example of how our commercial and operational teams work together to identify opportunities to create value for the business as these fuels typically require more complex handling processes you can follow the market and see prices at electricinsightscouk strategy in progress repowering away from coal options for drax power station to operate into the late 2030s and beyond moved up a gear in 2017 with the development of an option to repower two coal units to gas drax gave notice of the nationally significant infrastructure project to the planning inspectorate in september 2017 one of the units could be eligible for the capacity market auction planned for december 2019 local community consultations began in november 2017 and continued in february 2018 on options including up to 36gw of new gas generation capacity a

out more repowerdraxcom operational review overall we delivered a good performance during 2017 and maintained a strong safety performance we completed a major planned outage on the unit supported by the cfd contract this unit provides stable and reliable baseload renewable electricity to the network and longterm earnings visibility for the group the safe and efficient completion of these complex works is a credit to those involved and reflects our continued focus on opportunities for improvement and efficiencies the entire organisation has responded to a number of challenging unplanned events most notably in december we experienced a fire on a section of conveyor at our biomass rail unloading facility and consequently an unplanned outage from late december 2017 to midjanuary 2018 following investigation and recommissioning the facility has returned to service with enhanced operating procedures although this issue did not relate to the operation of the biomassgenerating units the resulting restriction on fuel deliveries by rail required the optimisation of generation across our biomass units resulting in lower ebitda and full year biomass availability than our target for the year financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 238 million 2016 174 million principally due to the cfd mechanism value from flexibility was below our target for the year principally reflecting a lower level of ancillary service payments versus 2016 our operational performance drives the results the financial impact of the unplanned outage on the rail unloading facility was mitigated by optimisation of our available biomass and the use of additional generation capacity retained for selfinsurance purposes however this incident is a reminder of the need to invest appropriately to maintain a high level of operational availability and flexibility at the operating cost level we have reduced costs reflecting the efficient single outage and our focus

shortterm power markets  we will also continue to explore opportunities for lower carbon generation to exploit our strengths and create opportunities for the long term to that end we will continue to develop options for gas and pursue efficiencies through our biomass supply chain performance review b2b energy supply our b2b energy supply business  comprised of opus energy and haven power  is the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power the key factors influencing our business are regulation competition and our operational performance regulation and competition the uk governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts the government will take forward legislation which will provide the regulator ofgem with the authority to cap these domestic tariffs svts are not a feature of our business our focus remains on the b2b market at the microbusiness end of the market which is closer in proximity to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are actively rather than passively renewing their power supply contracts the b2b market remains competitive with 65 different suppliers across the market our haven power and opus energy businesses offer customercentric power gas and services we offer simplicity and flexibility across our products and actively engage with customers to help them manage their energy requirements and reduce carbon emissions strategy in progress an innovative energy supplier 90 of the electricity that opus energy supplied last year came from clean renewable sources at no extra cost to their predominantly small and mediumsized business customers for those customers who want it 100 renewable energy contracts are also available  this was exactly what all saints church in ascot was looking for to power their business assistant church warden chris gunton commented we wanted to move to a greener energy supplier without paying a premium so approached an energy broker for guidance they advised us that opus energy were a reliable company with a good reputation and when we asked for a quote they were the most competitive it was a similar story for the salisbury museum in wiltshire nicola kilgourcroft finance manager said we were looking for an energy supplier that offered great value combined with the right length of contract and good ethics opus energy ticked all these boxes for us alongside supplying customers opus energy has power purchase agreements with over 2300 independent uk renewable energy generators these could be anything from a single wind turbine owned by a village community  to europes greenest zoo hamerton zoo park commented andrew swales director of hamerton zoo working with opus energy has given us competitive prices considerably better documentation and a highly efficient service wed happily recommend them operational review we have remained focused on delivering an excellent standard of customer service which is central to our proposition february 2017 saw the completion of the acquisition of opus energy which has made good progress integrating into the group supported by a dedicated team who have been working on systems people and commercial projects to ensure our processes work effectively together in march we completed the purchase of a new office facility in northampton  enabling the consolidation of four opus energy offices into one and the centralisation of the operational teams sales volumes at opus energy were lower than target reflecting our focus on margin which has remained strong and customer renewal rates were towards the high end of expectation this reflects the continued commitment to a strong level of customer service and in recognition of this opus energy was awarded utility provider to small businesses of the year 2017 at the british business awards  at haven power we have continued to focus on valueadding flexible products and services particularly to industrial  commercial customers whose needs extend beyond commodity supply this is demonstrated through our ability to help customers manage and optimise their power consumption profiles through collaboration with our carefully selected partners through better systems and services customer targeting and a keener focus on cost to serve we are driving efficiencies and improved margin at haven power following the acquisition of opus energy the major enterprise resource platform erp system upgrade was replanned which has led to a revised timeline from q2 2018 onwards we continue to actively manage credit risk by assessing the financial strength of customers and applying rigorous credit management processes with a strong focus continuing to be placed on billing and cash collection health and safety remains an area of focus for the business and we continue to target a reduction in the level of recordable incidents financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 29 million in line with our guidance 2016 4 million negative this was principally due to the acquisition of opus energy which added 10 months of ebitda but also improved financial performance from haven power which was ahead of plan third party costs tpcs include grid charges the cost of meeting our obligations under the renewable obligation ro and smallscale feedintariff schemes grid charges include distribution transmission and system balancing costs tpcs have continued to increase and now account for 50 of revenue total operating costs have risen with the acquisition of opus energy we remain confident that

energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while conversely generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management the uk is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart  a transition to a lowcarbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy in that context our groups purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this means that sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people across all our businesses doing the right thing every day with the right products and services we can go even further and help our customers make the right sustainable energy choices as our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base different generation technologies and operate internationally the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex at the same time the range of stakeholders looking to drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing the need for transparency is greater than ever so our websites sustainability section provides a comprehensive insight into the groups environmental social and governance management and performance during 2017 some of the highlights include carbon reduction  i am pleased that in 2017 the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high 65 of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15 of the countrys overall renewable generation we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced people  another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020  one drax  which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives safety  the health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to drax while the groups safety incident rate remained on target in 2017 the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did cause an outage with disruption lasting into 2018 it highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a riskbased plant investment and maintenance programme safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better customers  our

customers  decarbonisation  investors  sustainability drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags decarbonisation
