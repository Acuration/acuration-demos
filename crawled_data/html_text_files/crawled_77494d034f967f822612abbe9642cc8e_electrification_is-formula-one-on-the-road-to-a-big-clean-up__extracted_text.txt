formula one on the road to a big cleanup a pledge by f1 to go carbon neutral could rely on carbon capture use and storage ccus and other clean technologies 26 june 2020 electrification on the eve of the new f1 season the motor sport faces an existential dilemma while the covid19 pandemic has inflicted huge uncertainty throughout 2020 environmental concerns continue to question its longterm viability the australian grand prix in melbourne has long been the curtainraiser to eight months of gasguzzling decibeldeafening action on racetracks across the globe contributing to a carbon footprint of 256551 tonnes due to the season being delayed the first race will now take place in austria but the focus on australia has been sharpened by the new year bushfires  visible evidence say some scientists and environmentalists of the climate crisis this adds fuel to the fiery debate on formula ones perceived failure to take its environmental responsibilities seriously koala bear on eucalyptus branch escaping from australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020 significantly it is not the cars doing 70 laps that generate most of f1s emissions but the thousands of air miles covered by drivers their teams the media and spectators in getting to each race weekend activity  of carbon footprint  logistics road air and sea freight 45  personnel travel 277  factories and facilities 193  events 73  total f1 car emissions including all race and test mileage 07 carbon footprint of f1 in 2018 not including fans transport to races but is a genuine shift in attitudes about to descend on the circuits of monaco silverstone and interlagos firstly a raft of countries have announced plans to phase out petrol and dieselpowered engines between 2030 and 2050  this could force the hand of motorsport bosses who have long been accused of talking a good game but failing to act the sport recently announced a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030 and in pursuit of this goal it is looking to introduce twostroke engines that run on synthetic fuel by the mid2020s while current f1 hybrid engines will be replaced by a new specification of power unit from 2025 or 2026 max verstappen formula one driver currently under article 1944 of the fias 2019 technical regulation for f1 a minimum of 575 of the fuel must comprise biocomponents the sport wants to reach 100 aiming for 10 in 2021 and a gradual subsequent increase such developments could potentially seize upon the opportunities offered by companies pioneering the use of carbon capture use and storage ccus  such as drax one of several ideas discussed to make the sport more sustainable has been capturing carbon that is then mixed with hydrogen from water to form liquid fuel such technology is in development and drax is researching how carbon dioxide co 2  can be used to produce fuels its innovation engineers recently met with velocys the fuels technology company which plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the humber could f1 go electric while greener fuels are the most obvious way forward there have been calls for alternative forms of energy to be used to power f1 cars a hydrogen solution could be developed quickly but it would significantly increase the bulkiness and weight of cars but what about electric formula one race car electric power is attractive but its currently still quite difficult to scale that up pat symonds chief technical officer at formula one said in an interview  with any of the technologies on the horizon at the moment an electric truck or an electric aircraft is not a particularly feasible product so there is still a case for having liquid hydrocarbon fuels in trucks and in aircraft however what we cannot do is carry on digging those out of the ground were going to have to somehow synthesise them and thats what we want formula 1 to explore and hopefully to lead formula e set to challenge f1 dominance another driver of change looming larger in formula ones rearview mirror is formula e while this fledgling sports claim to quieter cars may not appeal to the most hardened of petrolhead f1 fans its credible narrative of boosting sustainability in each of the 12 cities that host its races is always a potential attraction to new generations of increasingly climate conscious young fans take formula es opening race in riyadh saudi arabia the countrys most polluted city the sport is a beneficiary of the kingdoms aim to reduce its reliance oil and in the last six years the middle eastern country has invested over 350 billion in renewable energy projects mainly solar and wind saudi arabia formula e grand prix credit courtesy of formula e as with all electric cars there are challenges excess heat produced by electric motors is offset by reducing the performance of the car when it is too hot a series of cooling systems using radiators and fluid in closed loops regulate temperatures to a satisfactory level appealing to fans is critical for the sports prosperity sustainability credentials are a key strand but formula e is going beyond that and looking to optimise raceday experience through features such as fanboost this is an online voting system where the three drivers voted as fans favourites get a five second power boost of 100kj which can provide serious assistance when a car overtakes maybe this is just one innovation that f1 could learn from its much younger counterpart perhaps there is also a case for taking the best of what both have to offer  the cities the cars and the technology  and merging into a single championship whatever lies ahead in the future formula one is aware of the need to change it must do if it is to survive  first picture london e grand prix in set to take place in july 2021 credit courtesy of formula e share most
