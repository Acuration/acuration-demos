power station drax signs 40 million contract with siemens for turbine upgrades the upgrades will improve the efficiency of its biomass generating units making its renewable power production more cost effective 31 july 2018 drax power which operates the biggest power station in the uk has signed a new 40 million contract with siemens for the upgrade of turbines on three of its biomass units over the next three years the upgrades will deliver efficiencies as well as maintenance savings which will cut the cost of biomass electricity production at the plant in north yorkshire the work which starts in 2019 will take three years to complete with one biomass unit being upgraded each year as part of its planned major overhaul the efficiencies will be gained by fitting new high tech pipework and valves with new high efficiency blading and long life seals within the turbines on biomass units 1 2 and 3 since transforming half of the power station to run on compressed wood pellets instead of coal it has become europes biggest decarbonisation project  and the uks largest single site renewable power generator andy koss drax power ceo said we firmly believe that biomass has a longterm role to play in the uks energy infrastructure were looking at a number of ways to bring down the costs of our biomass generation  and these turbine upgrades are an important part of that work reducing the costs of our biomass operations will help to preserve the life of the plant and protect jobs whilst we continue to produce the flexible renewable power millions of homes and businesses rely on darren davidson managing director power generation services power and gas siemens added siemens and drax have a longstanding and proud partnership so its fantastic that we will now help them further develop their biomass solution once delivered this project will improve plant efficiency and flexibility and provide a further source of low carbon power to uk homes businesses and services drax has upgraded three of its coal units to run on biomass with a fourth unit currently being converted  due to return to service later in the summer it also plans to repower its remaining two coal units to use gas and develop up to 200mw of battery storage the cost of the upgrades are within draxs existing plans with payment upon completion of the works ends pic caption image of a generator core from inside the

group press officer e email protected t 020 3943 4305 editors notes drax produces 115 of the uks renewable electricity  enough for four million households its repower project was recently accepted for examination by the planning inspectorate with a decision expected from the secretary of state for beis next year in the autumn drax recently announced it is to pilot first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project of its kind in europe  which has the potential to enable the plant to become carbon negative drax group contributed almost 17 billion towards uk gdp in 2016 and supported over 18500 jobs across the country drax power station makes a significant socioeconomic impact contributing more than 05 billion to the economy and supporting more than 6000 jobs across the northern
