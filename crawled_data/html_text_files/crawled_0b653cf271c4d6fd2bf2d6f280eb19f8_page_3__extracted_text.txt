international papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in the us some areas have already seen sawtimber prices increase as they recover from the recession  however the report suggests this is not spread evenly on a national level the inventory overhang in morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets ensuring the biomass used at drax power station is sustainably sourced is crucial to its generation of renewable carbonneutral electricity and in turn laying the path to negative emissions  read the full report morehouse louisiana catchment area analysis  a short summary of its analysis

around the drax morehouse bioenergy plant has a long history of active management for timber production 96 of the forest owners are private and around half of these are corporate investors seeking a financial return from forest management  the pulp and paper pp sector dominates the market for low grade roundwood with over 75 of the total demand the wood pellet markets use only 6 of the roundwood of which 4 is used by morehouse given the small scale of demand in the pellet sector the extent of influence is limited however the new pellet markets have had a positive impact replacing some of the declining demand in the pp sector and providing a market for thinnings for some forest owners and a new offtake for sawmill residues pine forest is dominant in this area with an increasing inventory

the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required

reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class

following its first meeting on friday 15th november 2019 attendees john beddington chair john krebs deputy chair virginia dale sam fankhauser elena schmidt robert matthews exofficio member during the meeting iab members discussed the role of the iab reflected on the public launch of the iab reviewed and accepted the iabs terms of reference developed its understanding of draxs business considered draxs approach to sustainable biomass including its new responsible sourcing policy  explored the climate aspects of draxs new responsible sourcing policy in light of forest researchs work on the carbon impacts of biomass  explored draxs use of the independent sustainable biomass program standard to evidence their performance against drax policies the iab shares this summary of its findings and recommendations the iab agreed that its role is to provide independent advice to drax on its sustainable biomass policy and practice iab members will do this by scrutinising the science and evidence informing draxs approach and by providing independent feedback to drax on how it can adopt best practices in addition to holding two face to face meetings each year the iab agreed to hold two interim telephone meetings the iab recommended drax refer to forest environment not natural environment in its policy the iab noted that the ten criteria drax have outlined to reduce the carbon emissions of its biomass approach have been designed to reflect the findings of forest researchs carbon impacts of biomass consumed in the eu report 2018 the iab found that the drax criteria are an accurate interpretation of the report the iab would like to explore how the science can further be developed with regard to the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood and consider how draxs policy might evolve the iab and drax discussed the possibility of developing some sub criteria for specific forest types the iab suggested drax could consider a restatement of the evidence academic review process to better understand and draw alignment on where there is scientific evidence on the sustainability of biomass the iab suggested drax should consider both a goal to continuously improve and consider the longer term implications of its policy commitments in light of potential climate changes the iab emphasised that the way drax operationalises its commitments will be critical it stressed the importance of robustly exploring the counterfactuals to draxs biomass activities highlighting the potential for tradeoffs between climate and biodiversity outcomes as an area for more detailed review the iab highlighted a number of considerations for drax in its use of the sustainable biomass program sbp it welcomed sbps adoption of a multistakeholder approach and suggested it will be important to scrutinise its evolution it noted that as draxs sustainability commitments go beyond sbps current criteria drax needs a strategy on how to evidence the compliance for these additional commitments the iab expressed interest in learning about draxs long term vision it noted that the ceasing of subsidies in 2027 will be a key milestone and highlighted its interest in exploring draxs strategy for managing this in future meetings with drax the iab will further examine evidence of draxs approach performance and impact against its commitments to identify any changes that drax may need to make the iab noted the following specific topics for further consideration evidence relating to the impact of thinning a forest on carbon pest control and fire risks how drax operationalises

their forests 14 november 2018 sustainable bioenergy from arcticcircle snowladen pines to damp equatorial rainforests to dry australian scrublands the planet is home to an incredibly diverse range of forested environments and while each region is very different almost all have been impacted by humans the effects of this have not always been positive and despite decades spent raising awareness of the importance of forests for the health of the world some regions forests remain in decline africa and asia in particular have seen a decline in forest cover although each year sees less lost over the past few decades but there are areas where the impact of humans is in fact having a positive effect this is largely thanks to the introduction of modern sustainable forestry practices  which have incentivised growth and helped bringing a variety of environmental and economic benefits to different regions around the world a recent report by pöyry management consulting for drax has looked in depth at these benefits and in particular four regions where different approaches to sustainable forestry have brought a positive impact to people industry and the environment alike more than a testament to the beneficial effects sustainable forest management can have it shows that while the tactics methods and environments may differ their positive effects are universal us south turning around old practices weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama the forests of the us south from virginia and kentucky to texas and florida have a long history of misuse both indigenous people and later european settlers used disruptive techniques such as large scale burning and removed valuable mature hardwood on a mass scale often leaving areas to naturally regenerate that largely changed in the mid20 th century however when forestry became moreintensive and the need for sustaining a supply of quality timber grew more apparent the introduction of processes such as thinning and managed regeneration helped usher in a more responsible approach that has led to growth in both the forestry industry and forest coverage between 2010 and 2015 there was 50 more growth in the volume of forests than was removed from harvesting more than just growing forest area this means an increase in the amount of carbon being absorbed and stored from the atmosphere charts us south historical increment to removal and us south above ground carbon 19571997  in the us south around 86 of forest land is privately owned by either corporations or individuals but the economics of sustainable forestry practices has encouraged the overall growth in forests even with limited regulations on land use in the area in addition to the native birds and mammals that depend on sustainably managed

finland by taneli lahtinen on unsplash wood and wood products play an important role in finnish culture from its famous saunas to the worlds largest wooden church  multinational phone brand nokia even started life in in 1865 as a wood pulp mill a high demand for wood as a commercial product meant that a few centuries ago finlands forests where in a state of heavy degradation but starting as far back as 100 years ago sustainable practices such as planned harvesting and regeneration legislation were introduced the results are significant there is now more wood in finnish forests today than at the turn of the century the majority 61 of finlands forests are privately owned with the state owning 25 companies only owning 8 and 5 held by other owners many large companies however offer services such as forestry work wood sales drainage and tax services to private owners this collaboration between sectors allows for best practices to be easily shared and quickly become widespread as a result forest stocks have increased from 1500 million m 3 in 1970 to 2500 million m 3 in 2015 even while overall forest area has remained largely the same it highlights the effectiveness of legislation

years   as far back as the 1700s the uk had become dependent on wood imports from new england in the us and the baltics in europe following the first world war the forestry commission was established primarily to try prevent timber shortages during times of war but it went on to drive a boom in new plantations across the country and introduce grant schemes for private plantations chart top 10 net importers of wood products  in 2017 the uk was the worlds second largest net importer of wood products a problem with this afforestation however was that it mostly consisted of monocultures of exotic species that were well suited to the climate rather than regenerating native species the modern uk forestry standard is countering this practice by putting in place requirements for afforestation and replanting that protect biodiversity landscape and climate change as well as soil and water forest in argyll and bute some 73 of the uks forests are privately owned which includes historic estates and charitable trusts as well as investment funds despite the increasing forest area in the uk over the past century imports of both wood and wood products still make up almost 80 of the uks wood needs

south or finland but offers an example of a how to rapidly expand the sector while preserving its old growth or primary forests eucalyptus trees in uruguayan working forest in 1975 the country introduced incentives such as tax waivers on forest operations and later subsidies for new plantations as well as tax duties for timber exports the result was a surge in eucalyptus plantations which grew from 25000 hectares in 1987 to more than 1 million hectares in 2015 largely driven by interest from international companies and investors these plantations are currently managed sustainably with growth still exceeding removals eucalyptus is not a native species to uruguay but by allowing international investors to plant on land deemed of no agricultural or environmental value the country has seen enormous afforestation while 800000 hectares of native forests remain the economic impact is similarly impressive today forestry directly employees 15000 people in uruguay  55 in forestry and

from forests and you might think of the centuries of shipbuilding construction and cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource what you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest  nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used yet this is the reality of forests from essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible and as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows research into forest products and how they can replace the lessenvironmentally friendly objects is growing here we look at five of the most common products used today and maybe in the future that owe something to forests adhesives from tall oil anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff and its because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production  from glue to cement the substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil named after the swedish word tallolja  meaning pine oil it is a byproduct of pulping coniferous trees tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the kraft pulping process  however the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history these are also known as naval products due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees today tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing as well

produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses turpentine has been used since roman times as torch or lamp fuel but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine while doctors today would advise against drinking turpentine as was prescribed in the past it is still used today in disinfectants detergents and cleaning products giving off a fresh pinelike odour fuels to replace fossils biomass pellets from working forests are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy one other form is cellulosic ethanol a new second generation of liquid biofuel rather than competing with food supply often a concern in the creation of biodiesels cellulosic ethanol is made from nonfood based materials such as forest and agricultural residues left behind after harvest  wheat straw  and timber processing wastes including sawdust it is now being produced at a commercial scale in europe the us and brazil  woody biomass can also be converted into a petroleum substitute known as pyrolysis oil or biooil biomass is transformed into this dark brown liquid by heating it to 500 o c in an oxygendeprived environment and then allowing it to cool biooil has a much higher energy density than biomass in chip or pellet form and after upgrading can be used as jet fuel or as a petroleum alternative in chemical manufacturing  vanilla ice cream and carbon fibre from lignin lignin is what gives trees their tough woody quality  and after cellulose is the worlds second most abundant natural polymer polymers are very long molecules made up of many smaller molecules joined endtoend most often associated with plastic which is a synthetic polymer lignin is generally a waste product from the paper pulping process and is often burnt as fuel however it can also serve as a vanilla flavouring  a property that may make lignin an important resource in the face of an impending vanilla pod shortage  futurelooking research however aims to unlock much more from the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally  one of the most promising of these is as an alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids  these are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre as well as drugs and paint nanocellulose and the future of forest products cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production however this abundant substance  which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants  holds even more potential by shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light  this opens it up as a product with many possibilities including using it as a source of bioplastics  some bioplastics  polylactic acid pha pbs and starch blends  are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuelbased plastics and could potentially help solve some of the worlds mostpressing waste issues not all biobased plastics are biodegradable however the property of biodegradation doesnt depend on the resource basis of a material  it is linked to its chemical structure in other words 100 biobased plastics may be nonbiodegradable and 100 fossilbased plastics can biodegrade biobased plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate polyurethanes polyamide polyethylene polyethylenefuranoate or pef is recyclable can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oilbased plastic used to make water bottles celluloses combination of strength and light weight has also attracted interest from the auto industry in the ability to help cars become much lighter and therefore more fuel efficient  its flexible strong transparent nature can also make nanocellulose  an important material in helping bring bendable screens  batteries cosmetics paper pharmaceuticals optical sensors and devices to market the idea of using trees as a source of goods and products in everyday life might sound archaic but in reality weve only just tapped the surface of what the chemicals and materials theyre made of can do markus mannström from finnish renewables company stora enso said recently that we believe that everything made from fossilbased materials today can be made from a tree tomorrow as research advances trees and forests will only play a bigger role in a more sustainable future tags forestry and forest management and arboriculture  forests  technology better forest management 5 june 2018 sustainable bioenergy one of the most interesting outcomes of the recent analysis from the uks forest research fr agency on the carbon impact of biomass cib is the call for regulation to ensure better forest management and appropriate utilisation of materials the research was commissioned by the european climate foundation ecf to follow up frs mighty tome from 2015 of the same name this new piece of work essentially aims to clarify the findings of the initial research with supplementary analysis to address 3 key areas a comparison of scenarios that may give relatively higher or lower ghg reductions  in simple terms providing examples of both good and bad biomass based on the above the report provides a statement of the risks associated with eu bioenergy policy both with and without specific measures to ensure sustainable supply it then goes on to provide a practical set of sustainability criteria to ensure that those bio feedstocks used to meet eu bioenergy goals deliver ghg reductions not surprisingly the report finds that unconstrained and unregulated use of biomass could lead to poor ghg emission results even net emissions rather than removals this again is a nobrainer no reasonably minded person even the most ardent bioenergy advocate would suggest that biomass use should be unconstrained and unregulated there are plenty of obvious scenarios where biomass use would be bad but that doesnt mean that any use of biomass is bad thankfully this analysis takes a balanced view and identifies a number of scenarios where the use of biomass delivers substantial ghg emission reductions the report identifies the use of forest and industrial residues and smallearly thinnings as delivering a significant decrease in ghg emissions this is characterised as good biomass  around 75 of draxs 2017 feedstock falls into these feedstock categories including some waste materials the remainder of draxs 2017 feedstock was made up of low grade roundwood produced as a biproduct of harvesting for sawtimber production this feedstock was not specifically modelled in the analysis but the report concludes that biomass users should strongly favour the supply of forest bioenergy as a byproduct of wood harvesting for the supply of longlived material wood products the low grade roundwood used by drax falls into this category among the more obvious suggested requirements are that biomass should not cause deforestation and that biomass associated with appropriate afforestation should be favoured agreed another interesting recommendation is that biomass should be associated with supply regions where the forest growing stock is being preserved or increased improving growth rates and productivity drax absolutely supports this view and we have talked for some time about the importance of healthy market demand to generate investment in forest management encourage thinning and tree improvement timber markets in the us south have lead to a doubling of the forest inventory over the last 70 years these markets also provide jobs and help communities and ensure that forests stay as forest rather than being converted to other land uses the importance of thinning as a silvicultural tool to improve the quality of the final crop and increase sawtimber production is recognised by forest research this is an import step in accepting that some biomass in the form of small whole trees can be very beneficial for the forest and carbon stock but also in displacing fossil fuel emissions the forest resource of the us south is massive it stretches for more than a thousand miles from the coast of the carolinas to the edge of west texas a forest area of 83 million ha thats more than 3 times the size of the uk given that a wood processing mill typically has a catchment area of around a 4050mile radius imagine the number of markets required for low grade material to service that entire forest resource so what happens when there isnt a market near your forest or the markets close over the last 20 years more than 30 million tonnes of annual demand for low grade timber  thinnings and pulpwood  has been lost from the market in the us south as the paper and board mills struggled after the recession what happens to the forest owner they stop harvesting stop thinning stop managing their forest and that reduces the rate of growth reduces carbon sequestration and reduces the quantity of sawtimber that can be produced in the future recognising that biomass has provided essential markets for forest owners of the us south and directly contributed to better forest management is a really important step the cib report talks about different types of biomass feedstock like stumps which drax does not use conversely the report also identifies good sources of biomass which should be used such as postconsumer waste which drax agrees would be better utilised for energy where possible rather than land fill it also shows that industrial processing residues that would otherwise be wasted and forest residues that would be burnt on site or left to rot would deliver carbon savings when used by facilities like drax all of these criteria are similar to those outlined in the 7 principles of sustainable biomass that drax has suggested should be followed among the other recommendations which echo draxs thinking are that biomass should not use sawtimber or displace material wood markets the scale should be appropriate to the long term sustainable yield potential of the forest  it should be noted that harvesting levels in the us south are currently only at around 57 of the total annual growth counterfactual modelling like that used in this report cannot take account of all realworld variables and must be based on generic assumptions so should not be used in isolation but this report makes a very useful contribution to a complex debate it is possible to broadly define good and bad biomass and to look at fibre baskets like the us south and see a substantial surplus of sustainable wood fibre being harvested a rate far below the sustainable yield potential drax is currently working with the authors of this report and others in the academic world to develop the thinking on forest carbon issues and to ensure that all biomass use is sustainable and achieves genuine ghg emission reductions discover the

that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met the tool is a unique certification scheme designed for woody biomass mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips used in industrial largescale energy production sbp certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of wood pellet and

wood that virgil and then dante locate the gates to the underworld while shakespeares magical midsummer nights dream plays out in a mystical forest near athens and while fairies and portals may be the stuff of fantasy the forests that inspired them remain a source of mystery to this day here are five more things you might not know about forests the forest sector employs more than 50 million people around the world employment is one of the major driving forces of global urbanisation as waves of people in both developed and less developed countries head to cities in search of better wages and living standards but outside of cities industries still thrive  particularly forestry which officially employs 132 million people around the world  the world bank even suggests that by counting people in informal forestry employment and those who earn a living indirectly through forests timber or fuel the number of people professionally involved in forestry is closer to 54 million worldwide forestrys total contribution to global gdp is also sizeable it currently adds an impressive 120 billion directly  a number expected to grow by as much as 50 over the next 10 to 15 years even more impressive is the contribution of the wider timber and wood product sector which generates as much as 600 billion  1 of global gdp according to the world bank we will soon be able weigh the worlds forests we know forests blanket about 30 of the land on earth  but what about calculating the mass and volume of all those trees thats a different task entirely but one which could offer important insights for sustainable forestry in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch earth explorer biomass  the first satellite to carry a pband radar which is capable of penetrating the forest canopies and capturing data on the density of tree trunks and branches essentially it will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the result will be a much clearer image of the amount of biomass present around the earths different forested areas and how it is changing over time as a result of carbon dioxide co 2  absorption forests are an energy source that clean up after themselves for all the ikea furniture made from wood 50 of the worlds total wood production is still used for energy with some 24 billion people globally using it for heating cooking and electricity generation the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the annual primary energy consumption making it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand  if it is managed and used in a sustainable way as with other energy sources that are combusted wood releases co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or a sustainable system of growing forests its carbon emissions are offset by new tree plantings which absorb carbon as they grow this means the only emissions produced are those that come from transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predicts that by 2030 forestry mitigation  with the help of carbon pricing  could contribute to co 2 reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes a year  forests improve drinking water forests provide whats known as natural infrastructure which not only regulate water levels but also improve the quality of drinking water root systems and organic material like the leaves and twigs that make up the forest floor absorb water reducing runoff and erosion they also play a part in absorbing nutrients that are harmful to water quality the forest canopy further helps this process by releasing water vapour helping regulate rainfall and providing protection against aerial drifts of pesticides which can filter back into water systems forests can suck up a third of co 2 emissions while governments around the world look to shift to cleaner renewable energy sources and cut emissions forests have been silently tackling climate change for centuries over the past few decades the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global human generated co 2 emissions in fact their ability to deal with fossil fuelderived carbon emissions is even written into the paris climate agreement while natural forests can contribute massively to sequestering absorbing and storing greenhouse gases managed forests can play an even more powerful role younger trees absorb more co 2 to fuel their rapid growth compared to older trees with stored carbon reserves managed forests with regular thinning and replanting of trees ensure there are plentiful numbers of these carbonhungry young trees around the world read the original 5 things you never knew about forests here  tags forests  sustainability keeping the options open 19 october 2017 sustainable bioenergy roughly 750 million acres of the us is covered in forestland  an area nearly 12 times the size of the uk approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets  1 2 3 4  name email comment sign up for
