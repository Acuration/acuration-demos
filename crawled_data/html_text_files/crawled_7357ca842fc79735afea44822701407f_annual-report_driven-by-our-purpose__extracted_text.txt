lease liabilities pension obligations or other financial liabilities market context why is drax important in the market supporting the nations energy needs tackling climate change and promoting the uks socioeconomic growth and global leadership ambition through negative emissions decarbonisation electrification the role of negative carbon emissions and a green recovery from covid19 2020 was widely expected to be a transformative year the uk would leave  and seek a new relationship with  the european union the reelected uk government under boris johnson would implement a new vision and manifesto including the levelling up agenda and cop26 and us elections in november would offer two very different domestic and international visions but very few predicted why 2020 would become such a watershed year the worldwide pandemic covid19 fundamentally changed the world with short and longterm socioeconomic consequences and global impact on health one issue didnt change however climate change and the focus on a green economy and renewable power rather than the global crisis pushing the green agenda into the long grass the general public reconnected with the environment during lockdowns and governments saw the economic benefits of pushing a green recovery with moreaffordable green technology net zero uk and globally the uk continued to position itself as a world leader in decarbonisation the prime ministers 10point plan and energy white paper included low carbon technologies such as offshore wind and carbon capture and storage despite cop26 being postponed by a year several major economies announced reaffirmed or accelerated their net zero commitments the eu set a new 2030 target for emission reduction to complement its target of carbon neutrality by 2050 south africa japan and south korea announced net zero emissions by 2050 china announced a carbon emission peak before 2030 with carbonneutrality by 2060 joe biden pledged to rejoin the paris climate agreement proposing to make us electricity production carbonfree by 2035 and meet net zero by 2050 bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs the uks climate change committee highlighted in december 2020 that 53 mtco 2 of beccs would be needed to meet net zero national grid set out in its 2020 future energyscenarios fes report that beccs was needed in the power industry in every scenario to achieve net zero in 2050 and could help the uk achieve a carbon negative power system as early as 2030 the uk government reaffirmed its commitment to carbon capture usage and storage safeguarding and building on its 800 million budget commitment in a minimum of two clusters in that context it announced a call for evidence on the role of greenhouse gas removal technologies ggrs including beccs this will inform key strategic decisions around the development deliverability and cost of different ggrs as well as the governments role in addressing marketbarriers supporting policies and frameworks flexibility and stability intermittent renewable technologies such as solar and wind grew in 2020 helping decarbonise the power sector however this growth increased challenges for the stability of the uks electricity grid caused by generation outages and low wind levels national grid twice issued an electricity margin notice  a warning that the margin between electricity supply and demand on the system had tightened to critical levels  for the first time since 2016 this underscored the need to increase flexible generation and technologies such as draxs pumped storage and biomass to keep the system stable and balanced electrification according to national grids fes report electricity demand could double between now and 2050 one of the key components of net zero will be the substantialincrease in the electrification of various sectors of the economy such as heat and transportation with wind and solar technologies likely to supply the bulk of this generation flexible technologies will play a role in managing their integration and constraints the fes report estimates that up to 20 gw of hydrogen power and up to40 gw of storage such as that provided by pumped storage hydro could be required to balance the grid in 2050 drax impact drax already plays an active role in decarbonising the energy system and providing stability and flexibility our strategic focus for a net zero future remains increasing pumped storage and sustainable biomass selfsupply whilst progressing beccs to be carbon negative by 2030 we are also continuing to focus on giving our customers control of their energy covid19 and the green bounce back energy covid19s global economic impact also affected the uk power market in 2020 alone the average wholesale power price fell 44 with average electricity demand down by 13 the costs of balancing the system rose 51 to 293 million whilst the share of renewables increased from 28 to 384 with biomass increasing 84and fossil fuel decreasing by 174 green economic recovery it has become increasingly clear that a covid19 socioeconomic recovery in the uk will focus on green technologies and industries using private finance to fund immediate and future priorities such as green infrastructure this could create tens of thousands of jobs around the country such as offshore wind carbon capture and storage and hydrogen drax impact drax can be at the heart of the green economic recovery in the north scaling up beccs at drax could support thousands of jobs during construction at its peak and contribute significantly to the local economy according to a report from vivid economics commissioned by drax delivering the zero carbon humber project could create and support tens of thousandsof jobs locally and throughout the supply chain according to the report many businesses will be remembered for their actions during the covid19 pandemic at drax we generated good returns for shareholders with a sustainable and growing dividend and increased share price whilst keeping the lights on avoiding furloughing employees and supporting our employees customers and communities global situation cop26 cop26 in glasgow was postponed to 2021 but offers potential to be a major success for the uk both domestically and internationally the uk government will want to showcase innovative decarbonisation technologies ahead of cop26 this will be an opportunity for drax to continue to explain how it can be part of a diverse green energy mix to meet net zero with innovative advancements technologically through beccs ccs and hydrogen and financially through new green finance models biomass acceptability in the us eu and in the uk policy makers have continued to regulate biomass in the context of global and domestic efforts to meet net zero in the eu the european commissions green new deal proposed a new biodiversity strategy and reopening key legislation such as the redii and eu ets in the uk the government announced it would begin work on a new bioenergy strategy  to be published in 2022 in the us the epa has been actively considering the carbon credentials of biomass the uk governments beis attitudes survey shows that public support for biomass continues to rise eu carbon targets with the eus increased net zero ambition and timetable biomass is likely to play a key role in helping the eu to meet its ambitious targets this increased ambition will have implications for carbon pricing and could result in higher carbon prices in the ukeven after brexit the uk announced a uk emissions trading scheme ets to replace the euets from 1 january 2021 the eu is also examining the potential to introduce a carbon borderadjustment where noneu countries will be required to account for an implied carbon price to import goods into the eu drax impact despite covid19 challenges draxs global supply chain for pellets has remained resilient as in 2020 drax will continue to engage with uk eu and us policymakers on the role of biomass through the beis biomass strategy revision of redii and new us administration in 2021 drax is positioning itself as one of the business leaders for cop26 and will

to become a carbon negative company by 2030 we believe beccs technology could have global application in the delivery of negative carbon emissions introduction drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future this informs our strategy of building a longterm future for sustainable biomass becoming the leading provider of electricity system stability in the uk and giving customerscontrol of their energy since 2012 we have reduced draxs carbon emissions by over 85 principally reflecting our longterm investment in sustainable biomass during the year we made further progress announcing in february 2020 an end to commercial coal generation effective in march 2021 in january 2021 we completed the sale of our gas generation portfolio further reducing our carbon emissions more recently on 8 february 2021 we announced the proposed acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc which is expected to position drax as the worlds leading biomass generation and supply business alongside the continued development of draxs ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 the proposed acquisition is subject to shareholder approval and certain court and regulatory approvals there remains more we can do to reduce carbon emissions with the right negative emissions framework from the uk government we aim to achieve our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 using beccs technology we believe this technology could have global application in the delivery of negative carbon emissions through these activities we expect to play a major role in delivering the uks legally binding objective to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions operations covid19 and supporting stakeholders 2020 witnessed the outbreak of covid19 with unprecedented global impact for drax the safety and wellbeing of colleagues remained paramount the board held additional meetings overseeing the groups response understanding the impacton colleagues customers communities andother stakeholders as a strategic part of the uks critical national infrastructure we recognise our responsibility to support the countrys response to covid19 and our stakeholderswe maintained high levels of power generation throughout 2020 and we did not seek any covid19 financial support from the uk government nor did we furlough any employees we provided extra support to our customers particularly the small and mediumsize enterprises smes that were adversely affected we froze energy payments from care homes in communities local to drax and offered debt support to customers we supported our communities in the uk and us with charitable donations and provided over 850 free laptops to enable home learning for students in our communities throughout the pandemic we have continued to engage with shareholders to explain our expectations of the impact of covid19 on the group and the board has considered their feedback operationally our generation portfolio performed well in 2020 the group was the largest source of renewable electricity by output in the uk providing 11 of the total from its biomass and hydro generation assets we also provided the system support services and operational flexibility required to help maintain grid stability during the covid19 induced changes to power demand additionally we completed two major outages on our gas and biomass assets with the latter including a turbine upgrade which will help contribute to our strategy to reduce the cost of biomass sustainable biomass has a longterm role to play in the uk and global energy markets both as a flexible and sustainable source of renewable energy and as a means of delivering negative carbon emissions key to securing this longterm role is reducing the cost of biomass and growing our supply chain we believe these actions will deliver attractive returns to shareholders and enable a longterm future for sustainable biomass which could include negative carbon emissions via beccs our customers business which supplies electricity and gas to businesses in the uk experienced significant challenges associated with the impact of covid19 the sme market suffered most from this impact with lower energy demand and in some cases an increase in business failures throughout the year our teams have focused on supporting customers as well as working to deliver improvements we continue to monitor the situation and assess the options for this part ofthe business results and dividend adjusted ebitda in 2020 including both continuing and discontinued operations was 412 million see page 22 for further detail and a reconciliation to relevant ifrs measures this was a small increase on 2019 410 million despite the impact of covid19 which was principally associated with the performance of our customers business we believe this was a strong performance within the context of a challenging environment at the 2020 half year results we confirmed an interim dividend of 27 million 68 pence per share the board proposes to pay a final dividend in respect of 2020 of 41 million equivalent to 103 pence per share making the full year 2020 dividend 68 million 171 pence per share 2019 63 million 159 pence per share this represents a 75 increase on 2019 and is consistent with our policy to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the strategy delivers stable earnings strong cashflows and opportunities for growth in determining the continued appropriateness of the dividend the board considered a range of factors these included trading performance current liquidity the outlook for the year in the context of covid19 as well as the steps being taken to support all stakeholders the board believes payment of the final dividend remains consistent with the groups commitment to all stakeholders the group has a clear capital allocation policy which it applied throughout 2020 in determining the rate of growth in dividends from one year to the next the board will take account of cash flows the less predictable cash flows from the groups commoditylinked revenue streams and future investment opportunities the latter includes our stated intent to invest to expand the groups biomass supply chain andreduce the cost of biomass if there is a buildup of capital the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders during 2020 we supported stakeholders in response to covid19 and maintained high levels of power generation throughout the year philip cox cbe chair people and values the board is committed to building a supportive diverse and inclusive working environment where all colleagues feel they belong to underpin this in september we launched a new diversity and inclusion policy and approach listening to employees and ensuring a twoway dialogue is vital to understanding where we are doing well and where we can improve in 2020 we asked employees for feedback on our values and their experience of working at drax  which informed the evolution of our values  an important part of engagement as drax continues to develop and change will gardiner our ceo and i met regularly with the chairs of our workforce engagement forums these meetings provided valuable ongoing insights and feedback for the board in a period of significant change this helped us to support the business in managing the transition to remote working and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our workforce on behalf of the board i would like to thank will and the executive team for their leadership during this extraordinary year and all of our employees who have responded so well to the challenges presented in 2020 safety is a longheld and central commitment of our operational philosophy while the number of incidents is low we need to remain vigilant and work to reduce them we are committed to the highest standards and have continued our efforts to strengthen our approach across the group sustainability is at the heart of what we do and we believe that achieving a positive economic social and environmental impact helps us create longterm value we remain committed to promoting the un global compact principles on respect for human rights labour rights the environment and anticorruption board changes in april 2020 andy koss stepped down from the board after four years as an executive director and 15 years with the group i would like to thank andy for his valuable contribution to the group in this period conclusion in 2020 we delivered a strong financial and operational performance in the context of the very challenging environment caused by covid19 supported our stakeholders and continued to pay a sustainable and growing dividend in line with our policy at the same time we continued to make progress with our strategic objectives our biomass strategy is clear we believe it can deliver sustainable longterm value to our stakeholders as we realise our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future and we remain focused on this objective philip cox cbe chair group ceos review how has drax performed in 2020 we have delivered a robust

completed in january 2021 and expected end of commercial coal generation in march 2021 proposed acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc 1 see page 22 for further detail and a reconciliation to relevant ifrs measures drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future to deliver that purpose our strategy is to build a longterm future for sustainable biomass become the leading provider of system stability in the uk and give customers control of their energy our purpose also drives our commitment to the battle against climate change since 2012 we have reduced the groups carbon emissions by over 85 we are the uks largest renewable energy generator by output and have an ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 operationally 2020 was a successful year as we delivered increases in pellet production and increased availability across our generation fleet in spite of the challenges we faced due to the covid19 pandemic our colleagues have responded tremendously to those challenges with operational staff on site at power stations and pellet plants working in a safemanner while the rest of our colleagues have had to work from home as a result we have had a limited number of covid19 cases although sadly one colleague in the us died with the virus strategically 2020 was a pivotal year for the group in february 2020 we announced an end to commercial coal generation effective in march 2021 in january 2021 we completed the sale of our gas generation portfolio which was announced in december 2020 following these actions we believe our carbon emissions will be amongst the lowest of any european energy company as we work towards our purpose we continue to develop our options for beccs which we believe can become a world leading ukledand exportable solution for largescale carbon negative power generation subject to the right negative emissions framework from the uk government we expect to be in a position to make further investment in the development of this option in 2021 and to advance our ambition to become acarbon negative company by 2030 in february 2021 we were pleased to announce the proposed acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc pinnacle which we believe will position drax as the worlds leading biomass generation and supply business delivering against our strategy to increase our selfsupply capability reduce our biomass production cost and create a longterm future for sustainable biomass completion of the proposed acquisition is subject to shareholder consents and the satisfactionof certain conditions precedent as we advance our strategy we expect to deliver higher quality earnings reduce commodity exposure and create opportunities for growth aligned with the uks legally binding objective to become carbon neutral by 2050 this underpins our continued commitmentto a sustainable and growing dividend summary of 2020 adjusted ebitda a key financial kpi of 412 million from continuing and discontinued operations represents a small increase on 2019 410 million inclusive of an estimated 60 million impact associated with covid19 principally on our customers business we believe that this was a strong underlying performance which reflects increased pellet production biomass cost reduction and renewable power generationoffsetting the impact of covid19 on the customers business the total operating loss for the year was 156 million predominantly reflecting asset obsolescence charges and provisions for other costs following the announcement of the closure of coal generation at drax power station our balance sheet is strong with cash and total committed facilities of 682 million at 31 december 2020 and net debt of 776 million giving a ratio of 19x net debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing and discontinued operations for the full year in line with our longterm target during the year we completed a series of financing activities that extend the maturity of our debt to 2030 and reduce the cost of our debt whilst retaining the link between carbon emissions and the level of interest paid via a new esglinked revolving credit facility rcf in further recognition of the progress we have made on esg performance in december 2020 the cdp awarded drax an a rating for our cdp climate response 2019 c separately we are now a tcfd supporter and we reflect that framework in this report safety remains a primary focus since march 2020 our operational colleagues working at power stations or pellet plants have had to work in new ways to protect against outbreaks of covid19 on site while maintaining our contribution to the integrity of the uk power system i am very pleased with everyones efforts in this area and that we did not have any outbreaks of covid19 at our sites in 2020 in this context the total recordable incident rate trir a key scorecard measure of safety was 029 2019 022 this was not the level we expect although there were no major incidents the number of minor reportable injuries did increase we take any increase in the number of reportable incidents seriously and have implemented processes to improve risk assessment alongside a campaign to raise awareness of good practice ensuring the correct personal protective equipment is used operational performance in the us southeast our pellet production operations reported adjusted ebitda of 52 million up 63 2019 32 million this was a strong performance reflecting increased levels of production improved pellet quality and a continued focus on cost reduction pellet production was 15 million tonnes mt an increase of 7 2019 14mt which reflects a strong operational performance and good fibre availability compared to 2019 when heavy rainfall restricted commercial forestry activity pellet quality as measured by the level of fines larger particlesized dust in each cargo improved in 2020 lower levels of fines result in biomass that is easier and safer to handle throughout the supply chain as such there are safety operational and cost benefits in reducing the level of fines and we continue to work hard to deliver these improvements we remain focused on opportunities to deliver savings across the supply chain as part of our target to reduce the cost of biomass to 50mwh on 5mt by 2027 as a part of this longterm goal we previously identified an intermediate programme of supply chain improvements efficiencies and investments we believe this will reduce the cost of biomass by 35tonne 13 mwh on our existing portfolio by 2022 compared to 2018 programme commenced in 2019 in 2020 this programme alongside increased output and other incremental operational improvements resulted in an average production cost of 153tonne 2019 161tonne a 5 saving yearonyear we expect to deliver further savings as a part of this programme by expanding our existing sites lasalle morehouse and amite by 04mt at the end of 2020 we completed the first phase of these  01mt at morehouse  with the remaining capacity of 03mt expected to come on stream by 2022 realising these programmes will expand total capacity to 19mt providing economies of scale and allowing greater utilisation of lowcost residues in january 2020 we announced an end to commercial coal generation in march 2021 and in january 2021 we completed the sale of our gas generation portfolio this will further reduce the groups carbon emissions and we will use the proceeds to continue developing our biomass supply chain strategy will gardiner ceo in february 2020 we announced plans to further expand our existing infrastructure with the development of three new 40000 tonne satellite plants these sites will use lower cost sawmill residues and leverage our existing infrastructure in the us southeast to produce biomass at around 20 below the current cost of production we believe this model could provide 05mt per annum of additional lowercost biomass and that these projects advance the groups plans to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass offer returns significantly ahead of the groups cost of capital and attractive payback periods in generation the portfolio has performed strongly with adjusted ebitda of 446 million from continuing and discontinued operations an increase of 9 compared to 2019 408 million the portfolio produced 6 of the uks electricity between october 2019 and september 2020 the most recent period for which data is available and 11 of the uks renewable electricity making drax the largest renewable generator by output in 2020 this level of renewable generation is only possible thanks to a combination of portfolio availability and a resilient supply chain portfolio availability calculated based on the availability of each generation asset weighted by ebitda contribution was 91 2019 88 underlying this performance is a robust maintenance regime during the year we completed major planned outages at damhead creek and drax power station the latter included the second in a series of highpressure turbine upgrades across three biomass units which will deliver incremental thermal efficiency improvements and lower maintenance costs reducing the cost of our biomass power generation the final outage on the unit which operates under the contracts for difference cfd scheme is scheduled to take place in 2021 the logistical challenges of these major works in a covid19 operating environment are significant we delivered the outages with minimum delay thanks to the diligence skill and hard work of our teams and contractors our biomass supply chain performed well and to date there has been no material impact from covid19 or brexit on our supply chain or those of our key suppliers our scottish hydro operations  cruachan pumped storage power station cruachan and the lanark and galloway hydro schemes  have performed well these assets provide renewable electricity system support services peak power generation and capacity market income taken together with the daldowie energy from waste plant adjusted ebitda was 73 million 2019 71 million engineers look out from beside a turbine within cruachan power station in scotland system support services balancing market ancillary services and portfolio optimisation are an important part of the groups strategy they are also critical to the safe and reliable operation of the power system historically baseload thermal power plants provided both electricity and a full range of system support services as the uk power system decarbonises intermittent renewable generation has progressively displaced these assets creating new challenges in balancing the system throughout 2020 our portfolio supported the system operator in managing the impact of covid19 on power demand in the first half of 2020 a reduction in demand for electricity required flexible generators like drax to turndown and stabilise the system in the second half of 2020 a combination of cold weather lower wind speed and asset availability issues led to periods of increased demand at these times our flexible assets were able to increase output to help balance the system system support services and optimisation  our measure of performance in the provision of these services was gross profit of 118 million a small reduction on 2019 120 million which included income from specific constraint contracts which were not expected to recur in 2020 cruachan an important source of system support was successful in a tender process to procure specific nongeneration services  inertia and reactive power the contract which commenced in july 2020 is worth up to 5 million per year and is over a sixyear period this was the first tender of its kind and we expect the system operator to conduct further tenders over the coming years merchant power prices remain an important part of the groups earnings but by focusing on flexible and renewable generation the importance of merchant power prices has reduced we have a strong forward power sales position in place until 2022 beyond this date whilst an exposure exists it is largely associated with the three biomass units which operate under the renewable obligation certificate roc scheme in january 2021 following the uks exit from the european union the uk introduced a new carbon emissions trading scheme to replace the existing european scheme to which the uk no longer has access we believe that robust carbon pricing is essential for decarbonisation and an important component of longterm power prices with a growing level of interconnection between the uk and continental europe as well as growing ambition in terms of eu energy policy we believe that in the longterm uk carbon and power prices could trend towards european prices we also believe that with greater demand for system support services nearterm power prices could become more volatile  driven by system support service requirements rather than commodity market fundamentals the end of commercial coal operations in march 2021 and final closure of the generating units in september 2022 is expected to result in annual cost savings of 3035 million once complete we believe that this will help to support the financial model for longterm biomass generation at drax power station when the current renewable subsidy schemes end in march 2027 an employee consultation process was completed in 2020 implementing the changes will result in the reduction of 206 roles and oneoff costs of 34 million our customers business reported a loss at the adjusted ebitda level of 39 million 2019 17 million profit this reflects the significant reduction in demand caused by covid19 the cost associated with exiting hedged positions as market prices have fallen and the increased risk of business failure and bad debt  principally in the sme market around 30 of monthly billing looking beyond the impact of covid19 we will continue to monitor the wider customer portfolio to ensure alignment with the groups strategy performance in industrial and commercial markets was stronger with the addition to the portfolio of longdated power sales contracts to water utilities providing revenue visibility over the next five years just as the generation business provides system support services so too can our industrial and commercial customer portfolio over time we expect that this part of the group through efficiency and demandside response can contribute increasingly to the groups system support services alongside generation we continue to believe this approach will support longterm growth the customers business has a differentiated market position  selling purely renewable power while helping over 2000 independent renewable generators access the market innovation engineer inspecting ccus incubation area beccs pilot plant at drax power station 2019 we believe our carbon emissions will be amongst the lowest of any european energy company will gardiner ceo biomass domes at drax power station biomass strategy biomass has an important role to play in global energy markets as a flexible and sustainable source of renewable energy as well as offering the potential to deliver negative emissions via beccs we believe that the key to securing this longterm role is to reduce the unit cost of biomass and develop greater direct control of the supply chain the group is targeting control of 5mt of selfsupply capacity by 2027 currently 16mt plus 04mt in development and reduce the cost of biomass to 50mwh by 2027 through the delivery of these strategic objectives drax aims to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass including thirdparty supply beccs and merchant biomass generation the proposed acquisition of pinnacle accelerates the groups strategic objectives by adding 29mt of biomass production capacity from 2022 being a combination of capacity available to drax for selfsupply and longterm thirdparty supply contacts to counterparties in asia and europe in 2019 pinnacles production costs were around 20 lower than our own we intend to deliver further savings through the optimisation of existing biomass operations greater utilisation of forestry residues such as sawmill residues and the use of other lower cost renewable feedstocks the uks climate change committee ccc has set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050 this includes an important role for beccs to remove carbon from the atmosphere creating negative emissions beccs is the only largescale solution for negative emissions with renewable electricity and system support capabilities through combining beccs with its existing biomass generation units at drax power station we believe we could remove millions of tonnes of carbon each year from 2027 in doing so drax aims to become a carbon negative company by 2030 the technology to deliver postcombustion beccs exists and is proven at scale in september 2020 drax commenced a trial of one such technology provided by mitsubishi heavy industries in addition we are developing innovative technology options including ccapture a partnership with leeds university ip group and bp which has developed an organic solvent which could be used for beccs drax power station is in the humber region an area with the highest absolute level of carbon emissions in the uk owing to the industry and manufacturing located there this makes the region a natural site for largescale carbon capture and storage for energy and industry we continue to work in partnership with equinor national grid and others as part of the zero carbon humber campaign which we believe can bring new investment new jobs and worldleading and exportable negative emissions technologies to the uk we expect further clarity on the regulation and support for beccs and the humber cluster over the next two years and stand ready to develop this technology which is necessary in allowing the uk to deliver its target of a net zero economy by 2050 we expect global demand for wood pellets to increase in the current decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes that recognise the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation opening up new sustainable markets whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed sustainable biomass material globally there remains limited capacity to convert these materials into energy dense pellets which have a lowcarbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation the proposed acquisition of pinnacle supports our biomass selfsupply strategy which can be used as part of our options for merchant generator or beccs but equally it provides an immediate capability to serve the global market for biomass underpinned by longterm offtake agreements biomass sustainability when sustainably sourced biomass is renewable  and sustainably sourced biomass is an important part of uk and european renewable energy policy the legal framework and science which underpins this assessment is clear carbon emitted in the generation of renewable electricity is absorbed by and accounted for in the growth of forest stock this is based on wellestablished principles set out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change a un body which reconfirmed its longstanding position on sustainably sourced biomass in 2019 this interpretation is reflected in the european unions second renewable energy directive red ii and taxonomy rules which mirror red ii the group provides full disclosure of the carbon emissions associated with our generation activities as part of our annual reporting we also report the carbon emissions associated with our biomass supply chain providing a greater level of disclosure than other forms of electricity generation that also have carbon emissions associated with their supply chains the groups biomass life cycle carbon emissions in 2020 were 109kg co 2 emwh of electricity 2019 124 kg co 2 emwh almost half the uk governments 200kg co 2 emwh of electricity limit for biomass we maintain a rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability ensuring the wood fibre used and pellets produced are fully compliant with the uks mandatory standards as well as those of the eu we use lowcost sawmill residues and forest residues which are a byproduct of commercial forestry processes and thinnings from growing forests which help improve forest stocks and forest health the carbon emissions from using sustainably sourced biomass to produce electricity are balanced by the absorption of carbon from growing forests in the us southeast the source for most of our biomass increased demand for wood fibre has directly contributed to increased growth and protection of forests inventories have increased by over 90 since 1950 as more carbon is stored year after year despite harvests also increasing our forestry commitments are based on the latest available science from forest research the uks principal organisation for forest science our responsible sourcing policy for woody biomass aims to ensure we only source biomass that makes a net positive contribution to climate change protects and enhances biodiversity and has a positive social impact on local communities our policy goes beyond compliance and our independent advisory board on sustainable biomass iab chaired by sir john beddington provides guidance and independent oversight on the sourcing choices we make the advice and scrutiny from the iab means stakeholders can be assured that drax will keep our policies under review and that the biomass we use follows the latest scientific research and best practice other developments in our hydro business we are continuing to develop a longterm option for the expansion of cruachan its location ability to generate and absorb power from the grid and full range of system support services makes it strategically important to the management of the uk power system and aligned with its future needs we are continuing to develop options for new gas generation including four small open cycle gas turbine units at sites in wales and eastern england these flexible assets are intended to help meet peak demand and provide nongeneration system support services any development remains subject to the groups decarbonisation plans and the right price in a future capacity market auction we have taken the decision not to pursue the option to develop a new combined cycle gas power station at drax power station and continue to assess options for the site people and values sustainability is at the heart of the group and its culture we believe that achieving a positive economic social and environmental impact is key to delivering longterm value creation drax is a signatory to the un global compact ungc and we are committed to promoting the ungc principles on respect for human rights labour rights the environment and anticorruption the board is committed to building a supportive diverse and inclusive working environment where all colleagues feel they belong this is underpinned by a new diversity and inclusion policy and approach we value the views of our employees and have incorporated their feedback in the development of our values 2020 saw a significant improvement in the level of engagement which we measure as a kpi on the groups corporate scorecard  used for our 2020 cash bonus plan and determination of vesting under our 2018 ltip due to vest in 2021 the strong performance and positive response to covid19 across the group is testament to the hard work diligence and spirit of our employees i am proud to have them as colleagues and i thank them for their efforts in this most challenging of years outlook looking forward our focus is on progressing our strategy to build a longterm future for sustainable biomass to be the leading provider of system stability in the uk and to give customers control of their energy through achieving these strategic objectives we expect to deliver tangible financial benefits  longterm earnings growth strong cash generation and attractive returns for our shareholders our principal focus remains the expansion of our biomass supply chain and the reduction of cost to provide a longterm future for sustainable biomass this includes our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 underpinned by the development of beccs using technology already proven at scale to deliver negative carbon emissions through our expertise in biomass we are leading the way in developing this world class technology and response to climate change we are making good progress with the delivery of our strategy and will build on this as we continue to play an important role in our markets as well as realising our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future for the uk will gardiner ceo chapter 5 biomass sustainability  cost reduction there is widespread recognition among leading sciencebased organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that sustainable biomass has an important role to play in meeting international climate targets sustainable biomass has three big benefits it generates renewable electricity supports forest growth and provides a route to negative emissions biomass sustainability sustainably sourced biomass for use in the generation of renewable electricity is an important and wellestablished part of uk and european renewable energy policy in 2019 bioenergy was the leading form of renewable energy in europe providing twice the amount of energy of wind and solar combined the status of biomass as a renewable material when sustainably sourced is based on wellestablished scientific principles reflected in the european unions second renewable energy directive and taxonomy rules sustainable biomass sourcing practices are at the heart of draxs activities and have underpinned our transformation from the uks largest coalfired power station to its fourth largest power generator operating a portfolio of flexible renewable and lowcarbon assets with an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 in addition based on its utilisation of sustainably sourced biomass drax power station is also the uks largest source of renewable electricity by output we believe that sustainable practices are important to the activities of the group in the uk and north america are integral to good corporate governance and critical to the longterm sustainability of our business model drax sources biomass from established responsibly managed working forests primarily in the us canada and europe commercial forests are generally managed for sawlogs which are sold into the construction and manufacturing markets sawlogs command a financial premium which make them uneconomic for use in making renewable electricity from sustainably sourced biomass however the associated material and residues such as sawmill residues and forest thinnings are of use in other lower cost markets such as biomass and fibre board this process is fully compliant with uk and european legislation drax is leading standards on biomass sustainability and we are committed to continuing to raise those standards so that our sourcing policies evolve as the science develops our responsible sourcing policy for woody biomass is in line with the recommended sourcing practices set out by forest research  the uks principal organisation for forestry and treerelated science we have also set up an independent advisory board iab led by the uk governments former chief scientific adviser sir john beddington the iab provides independent advice to drax in all areas of its biomass sourcing in 2020 the iab reviewed our responsible sourcing policy and confirmed that it reflects the recommendations made by forest research we apply these standards to our own activities and those of our thirdparty suppliers we are committed to full transparency and provide an overview of our sourcing practices and publish reports for each area we source biomass material from at the same time we are taking action to reduce emissions across our supply chain for example through investment in rail infrastructure and by partnering with organisations like the smart green shipping alliance carbon accounting carbon accounting and reporting of sustainable biomass is an important area of disclosure sustainably sourced biomass is considered carbon neutral under uk and european legislation underpinned by wellestablished principles set out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change as carbon emitted in the generation of renewable electricity is consumed and accounted for in the growth of new forest stock drax provides full disclosure of the biogenic carbon emissions associated with its generation activities we also report the carbon emissions associated with our supply chain providing a greater level of disclosure than any other form of electricity generation  wind solar gas nuclear which also have carbon emissions associated with their supply chains forest growth we are seeing the positive effects that sustainable sourcing practices are having on the carbon stored for example in the us southeast where we source most of our biomass increased demand for wood fibre has directly led to increased growth and protection of forests inventories have increased by over 90 since 1950 as more carbon is stored in these forests year after year despite harvests also increasing negative emissions our confidence in the contribution that sustainably sourced biomass can play in the uks transition to net zero is echoed by the uks climate change committee ccc the ccc sees a critical role for beccs in enabling the delivery of the uks net zero carbon by 2050 biomass cost reduction building a longterm future for sustainable biomass is a key strategic objective for drax the group has identified three models through which it believes it can deliver a longterm future for sustainable biomass all of which are underpinned by the delivery of its supply chain expansion and cost reduction plans drax aims to expand its supply chain to 5mt of selfsupply capacity by 2027 from 16mt today plus 04mt in development and reduce the cost of biomass to 50mwh from around 75mwh in 2019 we expect to deliver these savings through the optimisation of existing biomass operations greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues and an expansion of the types of sustainable lowcost biomass sourced across the groups expanded supply chain drax believes that the additional capital and operating cost investment required to deliver this supply chain expansion is in the region of 600 million which the group expects to invest ahead of 2027 this expansion and cost reduction plan gives rise to the three options see page 17 which are not mutually exclusive the delivery of one or more of these models by 2027 is expected to enable drax to continue its biomass activities when the current uk renewable schemes for biomass generation end in 2027 expansion and optimisation of existing capacity drax currently uses around 7mt of biomass for generation at drax power station 15mt of which is selfsupplied by our existing pellet production operations in the us gulf we have also identified plans to expand our three existing production sites  lasalle morehouse and amite  by 04mt over the next two years  an investment of 50 million the first 01mt of which has now been completed this will expand total capacity to around 19mt provide economies of scale and allow even greater utilisation of lower cost residues such as wood chips and sawmill residues other projects include the colocation of a thirdparty sawmill at the lasalle plant to provide access to sawmill residues lower transport costs and improved efficiency a new rail spur connecting lasalle to the local rail network improving economies of scale in transport and fewer road miles and a new chambering yard at the port of baton rouge allowing greater rail throughput these larger projects are accompanied by small projects to improve operational efficiency such as greater efficiency in the loading of road haulage in 2020 these initiatives and others contributed to a 5 yearonyear reduction in cost per tonne the delivery of these projects amongst other incremental improvements is expected to deliver 35 per tonne of savings on 19mt by 2022 in addition to improvements in the us we have also invested to improve thermal efficiency at drax power station in 2020 we completed the second of three turbine upgrades which has improved thermal efficiency and alongside other improvements results in a reduction in fuel cost in the region of 1mwh the third outage is scheduled to take place in 2021 further expansion of selfsupply capacity in 2020 drax approved the construction of three new 40000 tonne satellite plants sited alongside existing sawmills in the us southeast at a cost of 40 million these small sites are designed to utilise lowcost sawmill residues and leverage the groups existing infrastructure in the region drax believes that this approach could represent up to 05mt of capacity and expects these plants to significantly reduce the cost of pellet production versus the 2018 benchmark and will be operational by 2022 we will continue to assess opportunities to build or buy capacity to support this ambition  both in north america and other regions where we can demonstrate the right combination of sustainability fibre availability cost and infrastructure exploring alternative fuels biomass residues from commercial forestry processes represent the majority of biomass used by drax for generation over the last decade as part of our work on biomass we have screened hundreds of different types of materials and we are now using this knowledge of chemistries and operational characteristics to inform the exploration of alternative fuels examples of these materials include sugar cane residues bagasse nuts and agricultural residues drax believes that in time such materials could represent a significant volume of sustainable biomass material trading and optimisation an integral part of our strategy is to develop a biomass trading capability this is an optimisation and risk management activity to support our aim to deliver lowercost pellets and nonproprietary trading through which we aim to optimise internal and external supply and develop opportunities in other markets drax has identified three opportunities for the longterm use of sustainable biomass merchant biomass generation at drax power station biomass has an important role to play in the uk as a flexible and reliable source of renewable energy complementing increased utilisation of intermittent and inflexible generation across the uk power grid in march 2027 when the current renewable schemes end drax believes that through a combination of peak power generation system support services capacity market income and a lowcost operating model for drax power station including lowcost biomass this site can continue to operate as a merchant renewable power station bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs the ccc has set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050 this includes a significant role for beccs to remove carbon from the atmosphere creating negative emissions beccs is the only largescale solution for negative emissions that also generates renewable electricity and can provide system support services through combining beccs with our existing biomass generation units at drax power station we believe we could remove millions of tonnes of carbon each year from 2027 in doing so drax aims to become a carbon negative company by 2030 the technology to deliver postcombustion beccs exists and is proven at scale in september 2020 drax commenced a trial of one such technology provided by mitsubishi heavy industries in addition drax is developing innovative technology options including ccapture a partnership between leeds university drax ip group and bp which has developed an organic solvent which could be used for beccs third party biomass supply drax expects global demand for sustainable wood pellets to increase in the current decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which incorporate the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed sustainable biomass material globally there remains limited capacity to convert these fibres to energy dense pellets which have a lowcarbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation as a result drax expects the global market for biomass to remain under supplied drax is therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in other markets  such as europe north america and asia alongside the uk establishing a presence in these markets could offer the potential for longterm offtake agreements providing diversified revenues from other biomass markets key performance indicators finance group adjusted ebitda

for further details the income expenditure and cash flows of the disposed operations for both the current and previous year have been presented as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of the disposed operations as at 31 december 2020 have been presented as held for sale in the groups consolidated financial statements amounts presented in this financial review are for continuing operations unless otherwise stated reconciliations between continuing discontinued and total amounts for each period are shown in note 55 to the consolidated financial statements on page 195 comparatives for 2019 have been represented to reflect the income and expenditure for the disposed operations as discontinued tables in this financial review may not add downacross due to rounding introduction the groups financial performance in 2020 has been robust delivering adjusted ebitda from continuing and discontinued operations of 412 million which represents a small increase compared to the previous year despite an estimated impact of approximately 60 million as a result of the covid19 pandemic most notably affecting our customers business 2019 adjusted ebitda from continuing and discontinued operations 410 million strong availability and output from our biomass generation units at drax power station underpinned this result in addition we saw value from system support services captured across our flexible generation portfolio and the continuing delivery of our cost reduction targets for biomass pellet production we estimate the total financial impact of covid19 to be approximately 60 million in our customers business we witnessed a reduction in demand and an increased risk of business failure affecting our customers this is reflected in costs incurred to exit our previously hedged positions and an increase in the provision for bad debt in the generation business we saw a reduction in roc recycle values and incurred increased outage costs but largely offset this by delivering improved returns from flexible generation we were also able to capture benefits from our substantial derivatives portfolio during a volatile period in markets 1 alternative performance measures income statement values described as adjusted plus net debt and net debt to adjusted ebitda calculations are used throughout this financial review all alternative performance measures are described in full on page 153 and reconciled to corresponding ifrs values on page 170 following the boards decision to close our remaining coalfired generation operations which was announced in february 2020 we recognised asset obsolescence charges in respect of the associated fixed assets of 226 million during the year in addition following an employee consultation process we have booked provisions in respect of redundancy pension costs and other closure costs totalling 34 million other closure costs include a provision for work to ensure the safety of the site following the closure of the coal units and a small inventory write down for coal we no longer expect to burn prior to closure all costs associated with the closure of the coal units have been treated as exceptional items in the income statement the total operating loss for the year  which includes depreciation amortisation and the effect of exceptional items and certain derivative remeasurements  was 156 million 2019 represented profit of 48 million the yearonyear reduction principally reflects 239 million of asset obsolescence charges plus the 34 million of coal closure costs described above the asset obsolescence charges are comprised of 226 million related to the coal units and a further 13 million in respect of the option to develop a new combined cycle gas turbine at drax power station which is no longer expected to proceed these oneoff costs the majority of which are noncash have been partially offset by a reduction in losses arising on the remeasurement of derivative contracts from 121 million in 2019 to 70 million in 2020 as a result of sterling strengthening during the year on 15 december 2020 we announced the sale of our ccgt portfolio to vpi generation limited for a cash consideration of up to 193 million subject to customary working capital adjustments this included 29 million of contingent consideration associated with the option to develop a new ccgt at damhead creek the transaction subsequently completed on 31 january 2021 the ccgts have performed well since being acquired in december 2018 delivering 46 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020 2019 39 million however they do not form part of the groups core flexible and renewable generation strategy the results of the ccgts have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and capital structure during 2020 in august we agreed a new infrastructure term loan facility agreement with committed funds in both sterling 45 million and euro 1265 million with an option to increase by up to a further 75 million in november 315 million was drawn under this agreement and a further 53 million was committed under the option which was subsequently drawn in december these commitments have competitive effective interest rates inside the groups current average cost of debt also in november we issued a new 250 million eurodenominated bond at 2625 which achieved a rate of 324 when swapped back to sterling a record low cost for a drax public market issuance at the same time we redeemed the existing 350 million sterling bond and the 125 million esg facility resulting in an improved maturity profile and lower allin cost of our debt portfolio we also refinanced our revolving credit facility extending its final maturity date from 2022 out to 2025 and converted it into a 300 million facility with esg credentials this delivers further enhancements to liquidity overall net cash payments in respect of debt reduced our borrowings by 176 million 2019 increased borrowings by 636 million linked to acquisitions we continue to generate strong net operating cash inflows net cash from operating activities was 306 million in 2020 2019 413 million the reduction when compared to the prior year principally reflects a net cash outflow from rebased derivative contracts of 27 million as the benefit of cash accelerated from such activity unwound over the course of the year 2019 net cash inflow of 104 million in addition 2020 saw the introduction of the new tax payment regime for large companies accelerating tax payments in the year of transition cash capital expenditure in the year was 174 million 2019 171 million the groups liquidity position remains strong and provides a solid platform from which we can continue to execute our strategy at 31 december 2020 we held cash of 290 million 2019 404 million and total cash and total committed facilities of 682 million 2019 615 million we remain fully committed to payment of a sustainable and growing dividend the board will recommend at the forthcoming annual general meeting a final dividend that takes total dividends for the financial year to 68 million or 171 pence per share an increase of 5 million or 12 pence per share when compared to 2019 financial performance adjusted ebitda group adjusted ebitda from continuing and discontinued operations of 412 million was slightly ahead of the prior year 2019 410 million despite the impact of covid19 this represents a robust performance in what has been a challenging year excluding the contribution from the ccgt portfolio classified as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was 366 million 2019 371 million our generation business contributed adjusted ebitda from continuing and discontinued operations of 446 million 2019 408 million an increase of 9 or 38 million compared to the previous year this result was underpinned by a 5 increase in total output from biomass in 2020 to 141twh compared to 134twh in 2019 this was supported by availability of 91 2019 88 our strong generation hedge book also provided protection against volatility in commodity markets resulting from covid19 despite this performance generation has been affected by the pandemic roc recycle values fell during 2020 and the cost of performing outage work at our sites increased as a result of implementing social distancing measures to enable this work to be carried out safely these factors were offset by strong performance in the shortterm and balancing markets plus some value captured from within the derivatives portfolio attributable to market volatility during the covid19 pandemic our pumped storage and hydro assets in scotland continued to perform well cruachan pumped storage power station contributed significantly to overall gross margin from system support activity of 118 million this reduced slightly from 120 million in 2019 due to specific constraint contract income and benefits associated with closing out positions as our coal generation forecasts reduced neither of which were expected to recur in 2020 this reflects the benefit of generating plant that is flexible and can turn up and down at short notice to meet demand reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to total operating loss m adjusted ebitda from

of the year as cold weather and low wind led to opportunities in the balancing market total output from the ccgts was 28twh 2019 29twh with an ebitda contribution of 46 million 2019 39 million on 15 december 2020 we announced the sale of the ccgt portfolio to vpi generation limited for total cash consideration of up to 193 million including 29 million of consideration contingent on the development of a new ccgt at the damhead creek site the sale subsequently completed on 31 january 2021 initial cash consideration received on 1 february was 188 million including 24 million in respect of adjustments for working capital coal contributed approximately 8 or 16twh of our total generation volume in 2020 2019 3 and a small loss as the economics as the economics remain very challenging following the decision to close the remaining coal units made in february 2020 total closure costs of 34 million have been provided for and treated as exceptional items and excluded from adjusted ebitda  a reconciliation of these amounts is provided in note 51 to the financial statements the trading performance of the coal units continues to form part of our adjusted results and will do so until closure the units will cease commercial generation in march 2021 and close entirely following the completion of capacity market obligations in september 2022 at which point we expect to see cost savings in excess of 30 million per annum some of this benefit will begin to materialise during 2021 the generation business acquires biomass pellets predominantly in us dollars canadian dollars and euros which we actively hedge over a rolling fiveyear period to manage our foreign currency exposure to a weaker pound the renewable support cfd and rocs received in respect of biomass generation is subject to uk inflation indices while some of our biomass pellet contracts are subject to us inflation indices this exposure is managed as part of our active longterm financial derivatives hedging programme we hold a large portfolio of forward and option contracts for various commodities and financial products the nature value and purpose of which is described in note 72 to the consolidated financial statements these contracts are held to derisk the business by protecting the sterling value of future cash flows in relation to the sale of power or purchase of key commodities we manage our exposures in accordance with our trading and risk management policies from time to time for example where market conditions or our trading expectations change action may be needed in accordance with these policies to rebalance our portfolio during 2020 this included restructuring inthemoney foreign currency exchange and inflation contracts to balance short and long positions across the duration of the hedge the value of such activity increased in 2020 due to market volatility during the covid19 pandemic the financial impact of these activities  which is driven by market prices at the point of execution  is included within the cost of sales of our generation business and therefore is reflected in our adjusted gross profit and adjusted ebitda this reflects the fact that the principal purpose of holding these contracts is to manage and derisk the cost of purchasing fuel performance in our pellet production business has been strong in terms of both quality and quantity of pellets adjusted ebitda of 52 million 2019 32 million increased by 63 and reflects a record year for output with 15mt of pellets produced 2019 14mt and 15mt shipped 2019 13mt in addition to increasing output and lowering the overall cost per tonne we improved pellet quality during the year with a reduction in fines larger particlesized dust when measured at disport from 79 in 2019 to 50 in 2020 a 37 reduction in the year this performance comes against a backdrop of covid19 and hurricane laura the latter of which significantly affected the areas where we operate in august 2020 our teams successfully operated our plants throughout these challenges to deliver a strong performance with total pellets produced 6 ahead of the previous year  a testament to their hard work focus and shared commitment to the business and one another we continued to make good progress with our biomass cost savings initiatives with the overall cost per tonne of pellets produced in the year standing at 153 per tonne 2019 161 per tonne a reduction of approximately 5 in addition to the increase in tonnage yearonyear contributing to the lower cost per tonne we commissioned a dry shavings facility at the la salle plant enabling us to process less expensive residual fibre products as set out in the biomass cost reduction section on pages 16 and 17 there are three potential business models for post2027 operations we believe that the strategy to expand selfsupply and reduce biomass costs supports all three of these models our customers business made an adjusted ebitda loss of 39 million in 2020 2019 adjusted ebitda profit of 17 million we believe the reduction of 56 million can be primarily attributed to the impact of the covid19 pandemic excluding this impact the result for the year would have been more in line with that in 2019 the majority of this impact was taken in the first half of the year and despite a further national lockdown during november 2020 the second half of the year has outturned broadly in line with the expectations we set out at our interim results in july we have experienced reduced demand in the customers business as a consequence of lockdown and social distancing measures in the uk although this effect saw some recovery in the second half of the year combined electricity and gas volumes sold in 2020 of 175twh were approximately 7 lower than prior year 2019 189twh as a result revenues have reduced and we incurred costs to exit previously hedged positions as demand estimates reduced and market prices fell overall gross profit in the customers business reduced by 50 million from 134 million in 2019 to 84 million in 2020 this reduction was primarily attributable to the effects of the pandemic this impact was partially mitigated by delivering operating cost savings across the group during the year with consolidated adjusted operating and administrative expenses from continuing and discontinued operations 16 million lower in 2020 than the prior year covid19 has also increased our expectation of business failures and bad debt charges particularly in the sme segment and among customers in higherrisk industries this is reflected in the charge for impairment losses on trade receivables for the year of 43 million which has increased by 25 million compared to the prior year 2019 18 million the bad debt charge for the year represents 2 of total customers revenue including revenues derived from lowerrisk segments and larger industrial and commercial customers up from less than 1 in 2019 the overall provision for trade receivables at the end of 2020 of 60 million 2019 47 million is based on a consistent methodology with that used at the end of prior periods updated to reflect our experience of cash collections and potential customer business failures in the period since the first lockdown came into effect in march 2020 and using that experience to inform our assumptions about future performance in addition we have credit insurance coverage to help further mitigate some of this risk we will continue to monitor the wider customers portfolio to ensure alignment with the groups strategy whilst we remain cautious about the trajectory for covid19 recovery in our forecasts we anticipate a return to profitability at ebitda level for this business central and other costs which reflect our core services functions including our innovation teams were 50 million in 2020 2019 46 million the increase from the previous year reflects additional investment of 8 million in innovation activities in support of our strategy including the development of beccs and the zerocarbon humber project and an increase in insurance costs other central operating costs reduced  in 2019 we incurred oneoff costs associated with implementing a new operating structure and a higher level of costs associated with working capital management initiatives which have not recurred in 2020 in 2021 we expect the overall trend of investment in innovation to continue we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and capital structure during 2020 and delivered a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 19x andy skelton cfo total operating lossprofit the total operating loss for 2020 of 156 million 2019 represented profit of 48 million includes the effect of exceptional items and remeasurement gains and losses on derivative contracts that are excluded from adjusted results our policy and approach to calculating adjusted results is set out on page 153 in february 2020 we announced the decision to cease commercial coal generation at drax power station by march 2021 with the units closing fully once existing capacity market obligations are concluded in september 2022 following this decision we recognised asset obsolescence charges in respect of associated fixed assets of 226 million we have also provided for total closure costs of 34 million in respect of employee termination benefits and necessary site reorganisation costs within the 2535 million range previously estimated a breakdown of these costs and the location of the provisions in our consolidated balance sheet is provided in note 51 to the consolidated financial statements all costs associated with the closure of coal have been treated as exceptional items and excluded from adjusted results see notes 27 and 51 to the consolidated financial statements for more information net fair value remeasurement losses on derivative contracts included in operating profit were 70 million 2019 represented losses of 121 million reflecting movements in the marktomarket position on our portfolio of commodity and financial derivative contracts to the extent they do not qualify for hedge accounting a further 22 million of net fair value remeasurement gains on power gas and carbon trades related to the ccgt portfolio 2019 12 million loss is included in the result arising on discontinued operations the net losses in 2020 are predominantly the result of the strengthening of sterling in the period which drives the unwind of previously builtup gains resulting from the value of our extensive portfolio of foreign currency exchange contracts these exchange contracts provide protection against changes in exchange rates for fuel purchases denominated in foreign currencies over a fiveyear period depreciation and amortisation in the year including losses on disposal of assets totalled 177 million 2019 represented 194 million a decrease of 17 million compared to the previous year following the decision taken in february 2020 to close coal generation associated assets were fully written down and no longer attract any depreciation charges a further 19 million 2019 16 million of depreciation relates to the ccgt portfolio and is presented in the result from discontinued operations profit after tax and earnings per share adjusted profit after tax from continuing and discontinued operations of 118 million 2019 118 million results in adjusted earnings per share eps of 296 pence 2019 299 pence adjusted profit after tax and eps from continuing and discontinued operations have remained broadly consistent yearonyear largely reflecting a combination of the factors described above offset by an 8 million increase in adjusted net interest charges and a 4 million increase in the adjusted tax charge the total loss after tax from continuing and discontinued operations of 158 million is significantly reduced from the equivalent profit of 1 million for the prior year with a corresponding reduction in total eps from nil pence in 2019 to a loss per share of 398 pence in 2020 total loss after tax reflects exceptional items and certain remeasurements including the derivative remeasurements coal asset obsolescence charges and coal closure costs described above in addition it includes 8 million of charges related to refinancing activity 2019 included 5 million of costs associated with the acquisition bridge facility described in further detail below the adjusted tax charge for continuing and discontinued operations of 28 million 2019 24 million reflects an effective tax rate of 19 in line with the standard rate of corporation tax in the uk this reflects the benefit of patent box tax credits in respect of the biomass unit conversions total patent box credits included for 2020 are 8 million 2019 8 million this was offset by the negative impact of revaluing deferred tax liabilities following the uk governments decision to reverse the previously announced reduction in future corporation tax rates in the first half of the year the total impact of this change was 18 million with 4 million relating to deferred tax balances associated with the written down coal assets treated as an exceptional item the remaining 14 million charge which reduces adjusted eps by 35 pence is included in adjusted results the group continued to benefit from research and development expenditure credits rdec in 2020 with claims totalling 6 million recognised as a reduction in cost of sales and operating expenses 2019 3 million the total tax credit for continuing and discontinued operations of 32 million includes the tax attributable to exceptional items and derivative remeasurements a full reconciliation of the groups tax credit for the year is provided in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements cash taxes paid during the year were 48 million 2019 10 million in 2020 the group fell into the new arrangements in respect of corporation tax payments for very large companies in the uk for the first time as a result the group must now make tax payments earlier than under the previous regime and the increase compared to the prior year is a oneoff impact on transition  eps based on profitloss for the year including continuing and discontinued operations capital expenditure we maintain a disciplined approach to capital expenditure with all significant projects subject to appraisal and prioritisation by a capital committee prior to approval this committee ensures overall adherence to our capital allocation policy and maintenance of an appropriate net leverage profile in 2020 total capital expenditure of 200 million excluding additions to decommissioning assets of 29 million see note 54 compares with 172 million in the previous year this was lower than previous expectations as a result of the deferral of some projects due to covid19 this includes nonessential works at drax power station and delayed timing of some investments in our biomass supply chain the increase compared to 2019 principally reflects execution of our strategy with significant investments made in the expansion of our us pellet production facilities alongside smaller projects within our generation portfolio to enhance efficiency notably the expansion at our pellet production facility in morehouse commissioned in november 2020 the extensions at la salle and amite are expected to come online by 2022 capital investment in our customers business has been limited to 7 million 2019 20 million the past capitalised spend associated with a new billing system of 19 million was stopped in 2019 and the group is engaged in active discussion with the supplier reflecting the suppliers failure to perform under this contract no amounts have been provided against this value as the group believes that the carrying amount will be recovered in full supported by legal advice cash and net debt we remain focussed on cash flow discipline and maintaining a robust balance sheet this is underpinned by prudent risk management which provides protection in times of economic uncertainty and a strong platform from which to execute our strategy the group continued to generate strong cash from operations in 2020 with a total inflow of 413 million 2019 471 million before interest and tax payments this reflects our focus on cash flow discipline and continued management of working capital cash received in respect of 2019 capacity market income in january 2020 72 million and a net cash inflow resulting from increased generation and a corresponding reduction in coal inventories was offset by a net outflow from rebasing of derivative contracts and an increase in net purchases of roc assets net cash generated from operating activities in the year was 306 million 2019 413 million in 2020 the group experienced the impact of the new arrangements in respect of corporation tax payments for very large companies in the uk as described above which increased cash tax payments by 38 million compared to the prior year our liquidity position remains strong reflected by all three of our ratings agencies evaluating our liquidity assessment as strong at 31 december 2020 we held cash of 290 million 31 december 2019 404 million total borrowings were 1066 million 31 december 2019 1245 million and as a result net debt was 776 million 31 december 2019 841 million during the first half of 2020 the group was assigned its first equivalent to investment grade from dbrs this affirmed the strength of our balance sheet strong nearterm contracted earnings plus the depth and breadth of our available sources of liquidity our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio based on adjusted ebitda for continuing and discontinued operations was 19x at 31 december 2020 2019 21x after adjusting for timing differences related to capacity market income and cash across the current and previous period the net debt to ebitda ratio was 19x at both 31 december 2020 and 31 december 2019 on a proforma basis taking into account the initial proceeds on sale of the ccgt portfolio 188 million  see below and removing the associated ebitda contribution 46 million net debt to adjusted ebitda at 31 december 2020 was 16x during the year the group continued to enhance its access to capital and strengthen the balance sheet in august we announced the agreement of a new infrastructure term loan agreement with committed funds in both sterling 45 million and euro 1265 million with a range of maturities between 2024 and 2030 315 million was drawn under the agreement at 31 december 2020 the agreement also included an option to increase the facility by up to a further 75 million of which 53 million was agreed in november and drawn in december the remaining commitments were subsequently drawn on 18 february 2021 in november 2020 the group issued 250 million of eurodenominated senior secured notes which mature in 2025 the 2625 issuance achieved draxs lowest ever priced public offering which once swapped back to sterling reflected an interest rate of 324 per annum the proceeds of this issuance were along with existing cash flows used to redeem the groups 350 million 2022 sterling bond and the 125 million esg term loan facility total costs in respect of the redeemed facilities including the noncash impact of deferred finance costs of 8 million have been treated as an exceptional item in the income statement in line with previous practice a significant proportion almost 90 of the groups debt now falls due in 2025 or later following the issue of the eurodenominated notes in 2020 610 million or 57 of the groups closing borrowings balance is denominated in foreign currencies 2019 374 million 30 the carrying amount of our foreign currency borrowings and consequently the value of reported net debt is subject to fx volatility as a result of translating balances at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date under ifrs we use derivatives including crosscurrency swaps to hedge the sterling cost of the interest payments and future principal repayments in respect of these facilities in note 41 to the consolidated financial statements in addition to net debt per the ifrs balance sheet as defined on page 153 we set out a reconciliation of net debt that incorporates the impact of relevant financial derivatives to fix the value of sterling principal repayments at 31 december 2020 this resulted in net debt adjusted for hedging of 819 million adjusted results from continuing and discontinued operations 2020 m continuing operations discontinued operations cumulative revenue

see note 27 291 16 275 total lossprofit after tax 195 37 158 in november 2020 we also concluded the refinancing of the revolving credit facility rcf the new rcf matures in 2025 with an option to extend by one year and replaces the previous facility this 300 million facility provides increased liquidity enabling the full facility to be drawn as cash previously restricted to 165 million the rcf has a customary margin grid referenced over libor and represents a small reduction in cost compared to the previous facility it includes an embedded esg component that adjusts the margin based on the groups carbon intensity measured against an annual benchmark the rcf is available to manage low points in the cash cycle and was undrawn at 31 december 2020 committed facilities of 45 million and 95 million under our new infrastructure term loan agreement also remained undrawn at 31 december 2020 available cash on hand and committed undrawn facilities provide substantial headroom over our shortterm liquidity requirements net cash released from working capital in 2020 was 37 million 2019 cash absorbed by working capital of 51 million we actively optimise our working capital position by managing payables receivables and inventories to make sure the working capital committed is closely aligned with operational requirements as in previous periods we have maintained our strong cash flow focus and continued to deliver working capital benefits from making sales and purchases of roc assets and utilisation of payment facilities however the overall utilisation of these facilities has decreased compared to 2019 historically cash from rocs has typically been realised several months after the roc was earned usually at the end of the roc compliance period however the group is able to limit the overall impact of rocs on working capital by making separate sales and purchases in the compliance period during 2020 such transactions generated a net cash outflow of 740 million due to more purchases than sales in the period the overall working capital inflow from rocs of 231 million reflects an overall reduction in roc assets held on the balance sheet due to decreased generation in the year the group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell roc trade receivables on a nonrecourse basis utilisation of these facilities at 31 december 2020 was nil 31 december 2019 nil in the first half of 2020 the group rebased several foreign currency contracts which resulted in a working capital benefit with total cash released from rebased trades still outstanding at 31 december 2020 of 24 million in the prior year total cash released from rebased trades still outstanding at 31 december 2019 was 84 million a similar exercise for crosscurrency swaps resulted in cash released from outstanding trades at 31 december 2020 of 56 million 31 december 2019 23 million the overall net outflow associated with rebasing activity in 2020 was therefore 27 million 2019 a net inflow of 104 million the group holds a large portfolio of forward and option contracts for various commodities and financial products these contracts are held to derisk the business by protecting the sterling value of future cash flows in relation to the sale or purchase of key commodities we manage our exposures in accordance with our trading and risk management policies these policies provide flexibility to optimise our trading position working capital and liquidity when market conditions allow whilst ensuring downside protection and prudent risk management are maintained in addition the group has access to a 200 million receivables monetisation facility which accelerates associated cash flows and mitigates exposure to credit risk the group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing and also facilitates a supply chain financing scheme which enables certain suppliers to accelerate their payment and which supports the wider working capital efficiency of the group there are no changes to the groups payment terms under this arrangement nor would there be if the arrangement were to fall away the balances outstanding at 31 december 2020 and the change in utilisation in respect of each of these facilities is set out in note 44 to the consolidated financial statements the overall net cash outflow for the period was 114 million 2019 net inflow of 122 million after cash payments for capital expenditure of 174 million 2019 171 million dividend payments of 65 million 2019 59 million net repayments of borrowings of 176 million 2019 net proceeds from new borrowings of 636 million and payments in respect of acquisitions of nil 2019 692 million distributions we have a longstanding capital allocation policy this policy sets out our commitments to robust financial metrics that underpin our strong credit rating to invest in our core business to pay a sustainable and growing dividend and finally to return surplus capital to shareholders as appropriate at the annual general meeting on 22 april 2020 shareholders approved payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 december 2019 of 95 pence per share 38 million the final dividend was paid on 15 may 2020 on 28 july 2020 the board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 june 2020 of 68 pence per share 27 million representing 40 of the expected full year dividend the interim dividend was paid on 2 october 2020 at the forthcoming annual general meeting on 21 april 2021 the board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 december 2020 of 103 pence per share 41 million payable on or before 14 may 2021 shares will be marked exdividend on 22 april 2021 this brings the total dividend payable for 2020 to 68 million and delivers 75 growth on 2019 other information covid19 brexit and going concern we continue to monitor and assess developments and the potential future impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance as described above our financial performance in 2020 was robust despite an estimated 60 million impact on adjusted ebitda and we have maintained a strong balance sheet with a net debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing and discontinued operations ratio of 19x at 31 december 2020 looking forward our business plan for 2021 and beyond reflects our central assumptions regarding the likely duration of the pandemic and the nature of the associated restrictions such as social distancing these factors alongside wider macroeconomic considerations can affect the demand for and price of power we continue to expect a detrimental impact when compared to precovid expectations in our customers business due to the reduction in demand and increase in bad debt risk described above our forecasts for 2021 assume a gradual easing of lockdown in the uk will commence as the rollout of covid19 vaccinations progresses we are monitoring developments following the end of the brexit transition period our consideration of risk impacts in respect on brexit is set out on page 68 in addition to the routine scenario planning incorporated into our business plan process we have modelled a series of scenarios based on our principal risks a reasonable worst case and more extreme scenarios these scenarios have helped us to test the groups financial resilience over both the next 12 months and a longer period for the purpose of viability reporting see page 64 in particular we have considered the impact of extended generation outages across our portfolio taking into account risks associated with plant operations and supply chain as well as commodity price exposure to date such modelling has indicated that while there would be a financial impact none of the scenarios modelled would result in an impact to the groups liquidity solvency or covenants that could not be remediated by taking mitigating action in reaching this conclusion no additional financing was contemplated beyond existing committed facilities consequently the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue to meet its obligations as they fall due for at least the next twelve months while operating within the means of its current capital structure accordingly the directors have adopted the going concern basis when preparing the consolidated financial statements sale of ccgt portfolio on 15 december 2020 the group announced it had reached agreement for the sale of drax generation enterprise limited which held the groups portfolio of ccgt power stations to vpi generation limited for cash consideration of up to 193 million subject to customary adjustments this included 29 million of contingent consideration associated with the option to develop a new ccgt at damhead creek the sale completed on 31 january 2021 the group received the initial consideration of 188 million on 1 february 2021 which included 24 million in respect of working capital adjustments the final consideration is subject to a completion accounts process which is expected to conclude in the first half of 2021 the group anticipates recording a small premium on sale in its 2021 consolidated financial statements the sale price represents a return over the groups period of ownership significantly ahead of the groups weighted average cost of capital in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2020 the results of the ccgt portfolio revenue of 181 million adjusted ebitda of 46 million and profit after tax of 37 million have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement and the assets and liabilities shown as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet transaction costs of 4 million have been expensed to the income statement as incurred and recognised as an exceptional item within discontinued operations in line with our policy the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 december 2019 has been represented to show the results for the ccgt portfolio on a consistent basis as discontinued operations see note 55 for further details proposed acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy on 8 february 2021 the group announced the proposed acquisition of 100 of the issued share capital of pinnacle renewable energy inc pinnacle at a price of c1130 per share this values the fully diluted equity of pinnacle at c385 million with an implied enterprise value of c741 million including c356 million of net debt the acquisition price will be paid in canadian dollars and we expect to manage that exposure within our existing foreign exchange risk processes the acquisition remains subject to drax and pinnacle shareholder approval court approval regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions completion is expected to occur in the second or third quarter of 2021 the acquisition will be funded from cash and existing arrangements and is expected to be cash generative with 2022 ebitda consensus of c99 million1 net debt to adjusted ebitda in 2021 is expected to be above draxs longterm target of around 2x immediately following completion of the acquisition but it is expected to return to around this level by the end of 2022 andy skelton chief financial officer 1 the figure above was a collation of forecasts estimates and opinions made by a number of independent research analysts compiled by bloomberg and appearing on bloombergs website at the time of the announcement of the pinnacle transaction the inclusion of this figure may be interpreted as a profit forecast in relation to pinnacle for the purposes of the listing rules the directors consider that this figure is no longer valid because i this figure was representative of pinnacle as a standalone entity and does not represent draxs or the directors views of the expected financial performance of pinnacle under draxs ownership and ii the acquisition of pinnacle will result in a number of changes impacting pinnacles ebitda including the impact of purchase price allocation and intragroup trading adjustments chapter 7 system stability giving customers control of their energy  engaging our stakeholders engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station helping the uk meet its net zero target beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is a key project both for drax and in helping the uk meet its net zero target working together with our technology and engineering partners we continued to develop the project during 2020 and it is currently approaching the end of the initial engineering design process covid19 has presented some challenges with our partners spread across the globe but the project team have managed to keep everything on track through hard work determination and the desire to deliver this ground breaking project and help drax to deliver its purpose 2021 will continue to be a busy year as we complete our pilot testing and the project moves into the next stages of development  both technically and via the planning process carl clayton head of beccs innovation keeping our people and plants safe safety is a primary focus at drax and at cruachan we are hugely proud to have had no serious incidents in 2020 and achieved 16 years since our last lost time incident on site for me the biggest challenge in 2020 was introducing changes to how we work to ensure we protected colleagues and contractors from covid19 whilst continuing to keep our plants running safely and maintaining our focus on potential hazards and our primary safety procedures to prevent incidents and keep everyone safe thankfully weve achieved good safety performance this year at cruachan whilst delivering our outages and project work roddy davies hse adviser cruachan power station water outlet into loch awe from cruachan power station covid19 impact on executive remuneration how has drax taken covid19 into consideration when determining executive remuneration outcomes a key focus for drax has been on taking care of the health and wellbeing of employees during thesedifficult times the remuneration decisions taken appropriately reflect the performance of the business in 2020 and they are fair and consistent to all employees whilst 2020 was a very challenging year it was also a year of achievement of which we are rightly proud colleagues andmanagement worked hard to deliver our purpose keep each other safe and continue to deliver our essential services to thecountry this culminated in strong financial performance and further advancement of our strategic priorities which are reflected in the remuneration of the executive directors senior management and the wider workforce all drax employees had to adapt to new ways of working in 2020 the health safety and wellbeing of employees and contractors has always been of paramount importance but particularly so in these unprecedented times during the year the committee spent a considerable amount of time reviewing the remuneration and the working practice arrangements of the whole workforce within the context of the challenges of covid19 our priority has been to provide pay stability and security for our workforce many of whom areclassified as key workers this included ensuring continuity of pay for those who were unable to work due to illness or caring responsibilities as well as our commitment not to furlough or make redundancies as a result of the impact of covid19 you can find further information on how drax has supported employees through covid19 on page 34 in addition to supporting our colleagues we have also actively supported our customers and communities during this time for example we provided free gas and electricity for two months to 162 independent care homes allowing these vital organisations to divert funds to other priorities we also providedover 850 laptops with three months of prepaid internet access to over 50 schools this has helped to enable students at our partner schools to access lessons from home in addition to not utilising any government support as explained on page 88 the board received regular updates on the groups liquidityposition our available cash and other resources which directly informed the decision to maintain both the final dividend in respect of the 2019 financial year which was approved by shareholders at the 2020 annual general meeting and paid on 15 may 2020 and the interim dividend which the board approved in july 2020 and paid on 2 october 2020 the following table provides a summary of the decisions made by the committee in 2020 with respect to key components of remuneration in coming to these conclusions the committee considered several factors these included external advice theperformance of the company and the contribution of employees at all levels in delivering the 2020 group plan and the longerterm strategic priorities the committee also considered the extent to which covid19 had an impact on financial performance and on ourrange of stakeholders  whether positively or adversely nicola hodson chair of the remuneration committee committee decision 2021 base salary increases to increase the level of base salaries for all directors in line with the average increase made to all employees the company is supportive of an increase to the salaries of all eligible employees in 2021 which reflects our ability to pay and wider market benchmarking the increase applied also takes into account our commitment to not furlough or make redundant colleagues due to covid19 2020 annual bonus outcome to pay the bonus awards in the normal manner and in line with the policy with no adjustment the bonus award is reflective of the companys solid performance in a challenging year the company bonus criteria for executive directors are consistent with those for other employees all eligible employees will receive their bonus drax maintained its dividend for 2019 paid an interim dividend for 2020 and is proposing a final 2020 dividend for approval at the 2021 agm the proposed bonus payments are consistent with the shareholder dividend experience and our capital allocation policy the companys balance sheet liquidity and finances are strong we recognise that covid19 has brought into sharper focus the responsibilities which we all have to safeguarding our people our communities and our environment within the 2020 scorecard we included targets associated with a combination of safety and engagement with our employees reputation as well as esg measures that included targeting improvement in our cdp rating our employee engagement survey achieved 82 score for effective engagement and the groups cdp climate response rating improved from c in 2019 to a in 2020 more information on the 2020 scorecard can be found on pages 124 and 125 more information on the groups wider initiatives on the environment and climate change can be found on page 48 2021 annual bonus continue to use performance metrics and weightings which are consistent with what is stated in the policy the company is committed to the operation of a bonus plan for all eligible employees for 2021 and the bonus criteria are consistent for all employees on 8 february 2021 we announced our intention to acquire pinnacle renewable energy inc which is subject to drax and pinnacle shareholder approval and court and regulatory approvals as this transaction would materially impact all metrics in the 2021 scorecard it is not possible to set targets at this time for each metric which has been selected for the 2021 scorecard the targets will be set as soon as is practicable once there is confirmation of whether the acquisition will or will not proceed the table on page 132 sets out the metrics which will be included in the 2021 scorecard 2018 psp vesting to allow the 2018 psp award to vest without adjustment in march 2021 the committee is comfortable that the vesting result is appropriate in the context of performance over the three year performance period drax share price at 31 december 2020 was 39 higher than the start of the performance period given the averaging periods over which tsr has been calculated this equates to a return of 15 based on the six month averaging period prior to the start and end of the performance period these returns represent a strong result for our shareholders particularly in the current environment performance is assessed against a broader ftse 350 comparator group where the majority of shareholder returns have been negative over the performance period although draxs share price was initially impacted by covid19 in early 2020 as was the case for many companies it recovered strongly with a shareholder return of 28 from 1 january 2020 to the end of the year drax has not benefited from unexpected windfall financial performance as a result of covid19 and the committee is confident that this return represents genuine strong performance and delivery of our strategy in an extremely challenging climate 2020 ltip grant the grant was made on the normal timetable and with the performance conditions and targets agreed with shareholders the normal practice of using the threeday average share price immediately prior to the date of grant to determine the number of shares awarded was followed the ltip performance is measured over a threeyear period and therefore the targets remain appropriate the committee will assess the value of the 2020 ltip award at vesting and will ensure that the final outturn reflects all relevant factors including consideration of any windfall gains in making their assessment the committee will take into account appropriate advice eg the companys auditors the committees advisers and the audit committee also giving due consideration to the shareholder experience and to what extent the outcome incorporates any windfall gain which warrants adjustment we have provided further information on decisions made by the committee with respect to covid19 in the annual statement to shareholders on pages 109 to 110 taskforce on climaterelated financial disclosures tackling climate change is at the heart of our purpose and drax is committed to helping the uk and the wider world to achieve its climate targets the recommendations of the taskforce on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd provide a framework for consistent disclosure of climaterelated information drax became a tcfd supporter in december 2020 our approach progress and the next steps of our journey towards meeting the tcfd recommendations in full are summarised below in 2020 we responded to the cdp climate questionnaire which is aligned to the tcfd recommendations drax was awarded a score of a we will continue responding to the cdp climate questionnaire each year governance strong governance that embeds climate change in decisionmaking at all levels of the business our approach responding to climate change is a core component of our group governance framework the ceo reports quarterly to the board onenvironment social and governance esg performance including climaterelated matters climate change factors are considered in decisions taken by the board reflecting the boards duty to consider all stakeholders examples in 2020 include the decision to cease coal generation by march 2021 and the refinancing of the groups debt facilities which link draxs carbonemissions to the amount of interest paid on the groups debt see page 26 our climate policy approved by the board outlines our approach to integrate effective management of climaterelated risks and opportunities into everyday decisionmaking and delivery of our business strategy available at wwwdraxcomaboutuscomplianceandpolicies  our progress in 2020 in october the board reviewed our strategic aims and progress and re emphasised draxs commitment to our purpose to enable a zero carbon lowercost energy future the board considered how our strategy aligns with good practice for purposedriven organisations and committed to explore how this can be further strengthened through 2021 in 2020 engagement with the executive committee and the board focused on furthering understanding and embedding climaterelated matters engagement in 2020 included climate policy considered and approved by the executive committee and the 2020 cdp climate submission signed off by the ceo and at the groups interim and full year the executive committee and the board examined the climate change principal risk considering key evolvingchallenges and potential the executive committee and the board considered managements response and future plans for addressing the tcfd requirements approved initiatives to meet these proposals and approved drax becoming a tcfd remuneration our 2020 group scorecard included a target to improve our cdp climate score linking remuneration to our performance and quality of disclosure on climate change our actions for 2021 continue schedule of engagement with executive committee and the board on climaterelated see corporate governance report page 80 see remuneration report page 108 strategy a purpose strategy and ambition that places climate change at the heart of what we do our approach and progress in 2020 our purpose  to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future  is aligned with the uk government target to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 our purpose informs the three pillars of our strategy outlined below our energy market model uses a range of net zero carbon by 2050 scenarios and the resulting set of planning assumptions enable us to identify actions and the associated capital allocation that we will take across our strategic horizons 1 to build a longterm future for sustainable biomass by expanding our sustainable bioenergy supply chain and reducing costs we are developing options for longterm biomass operations  renewable generation negative carbon emissions system support services and third party supply of biomass to international markets we are investing in the expansion of our pellet production facilities as part of our biomass strategy targeting to achieve 5 million tonnes of selfsupply by 2027 and to reduce production costs we believe this will give rise to a longterm future for sustainable biomass which includes the potential for beccs and negative emissions this is supported by a robust supply chain that is subject to externallyset regulations and regular audits to ensure the required standards are met we are progressing the beccs business case and technology selection so that we can effectively implement and scale a costeffective carbon removal technology 2 to be the leading provider of power system stability through a portfolio of flexible and renewable generation and large industrial and commercial customer supply business we will provide system support services to allow the power system to utilise intermittent renewable energy accelerating the uks decarbonisation en route to 2050 we believe that as the uk power system decarbonises demand will increasingly be met by low marginal cost intermittent wind generation historically the operation of reliable baseload thermal power plants provided both electricity and a full range of nongeneration system support services these services are important to the safe and reliable operation of the system given its inherent intermittency wind power has limited capability to provide these other services making the system more challenging to manage throughout 2020 we provided these services to the power system via our flexible asset portfolio 3 to give our customers control of their energy we provide our customers with renewable energy and the opportunity to control and optimise energy use and cost helping us support the energy system to support the zero carbon and sustainability ambitions of our customers we are considering and developing the services they need our drax electric vehicles ev service enables customers to transition to evs or optimise their existing ev solution we also provide an electric assets service that helps our customers to optimise the energy usage of their assets and reduce costs esg finance in 2020 we completed a 300 million revolving credit facility this includes an embedded esg mechanism that adjusts the margin of interest paid based on draxs carbon emissions per gwh of electricity generated measured against an annual benchmark this is consistent with our continued strategic focus on reducing our carbon emissions scenario analysis we have considered the potential impact of climate scenarios on our business including robust modelling as part of our capital projects work comprehensive modelling was undertaken to assess the current flood risk and the potential future flood risk associated with the redevelopment of drax power station the assessment considered potential changes in sea level changes in rainfall and peak river flows based on guidance issued by the environment agency ea the ea projections considered data from the uk climate projections 2009 ukcp09 which categorise the range of possibilities from lower impact to upper impact in compliance with planning requests the assessment considered the impacts of the central climate projection through to the upper impact projection over a medium time phase covering the expected life of the asset the project identified a risk of flooding in the community and as a result a flood relief channel has been included in the plans our actions for 2021 undertake scenario analysis exercise see principal risks and uncertainties page 66 risk management integration of climaterelated risks into our groupwide risk management approach our approach the assessment and management of climaterelated risks is integrated into our groupwide approach to risk management as defined by the group risk management policy climate change is a principal risk category assessed within this approach the climate change principal risk is owned by a member of the executive committee and subject to a deepdive review by the executive committee each year an analysis of all principal risk categories including climate change is made and presented to the executive committee and board twice a year our progress in 2020 in 2020 we focused on the development of our climate change principal risk assessment process we strengthened the assessment of business division specific risks expanded the detail of our assessment and identified risk areas for targeted analysis in 2021 a summary of the physical and transition risks identified is provided in principal risks and uncertainties in 2020 the executive committee examined the climate change risks challenging the assumptions mitigations and controls which had been identified our actions for 2021 undertake targeted analysis of the risk areas identified for further exploration in 2021 see principal risks and uncertainties page 66 metrics and targets our ambition is to become carbon negative by 2030 our approach our ambition is to become carbon negative by 2030 this applies across our direct business operations globally scope 1 and 2 emissions we are committed to the science based targets initiative publicly stating our intent to externally validate that our target is aligned with climate science our progress in 2020 we disclose our scope 1 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions alongside other key environmental metrics in the sustainable business section see page 48 in 2020 we undertook work to better understand the detail of our scope 3 emissions we are developing a scope 3 target that enables us to align to the science based targets initiative our actions for 2021 set and publish a scope 3 target see carbon emissions page 49 our covid19 response how has drax managed the impact of covid19 keeping our people safe whilst providing energy and critical services throughout the pandemic we have successfully maintained effective daytoday activities and supported our people communities and customers we continue to maintain our sustainability standards and meet the needs of stakeholders as we progress our longterm objectives and invest for growth organising our response when covid19 was declared a pandemic in march 2020 we had already implemented our crisis management structure to manage information and our response and to better understand emerging risks management and leaders from the business units met regularly to define and communicate the drax response our leaderships priority was and will remain the health and safety of our colleagues delivering our purpose as a strategic part of the uks critical national infrastructure we continued to supply flexible and renewable electricity delivering strong strategic operational and financial performance for our shareholders and various stakeholders this allowed us to continue to invest for growth whilst paying a sustainable and growing dividend throughout the pandemic no employees have been furloughed and we have not sought any financial help from the government supporting our people we quickly deployed home working for the majority of our nonoperational colleagues following school closures in the uk we introduced two weeks emergency paid leave for childcare support as information on the virus and government advice developed we continued to adjust our response accordingly we introduced a covid19 absence policy extending our emergency arrangements entitling colleagues that are unable to work due to covid19 to full pay health and safety as our top priority we undertook covid19 risk assessments at each of our sites to identify mitigations to reduce the risks of workplace transmission of the virus throughout the year our operational workforce was able to continue to deliver our business priorities without a significant impact or transmission of the virus in the workplace our generation business which has continued to operate as normal safely delivered several major outages with large numbers of contractors on our production sites during the summer we deployed home working assessments and provided colleagues with suitable equipment to make sure they could work from home safely we continue to focus on maintaining social distancing hand hygiene and reduced occupancy of our workplaces as further waves of virus transmission occur across the country we are planning to ensure continued provision of adequate support for the health and wellbeing of all our colleagues wellbeing we surveyed colleagues to understand how they were coping and to identify areas for focus this was to make sure colleagues continued to feel connected and supported through the challenges presented by covid19 to further support our colleagues physical and mental wellbeing we expanded our virtual wellbeing tools and resources offering read more on wellbeing in our sustainable business section page 58 of the full report pdf charitable and community engagement we continued to provide colleagues with ways to engage in community and charity activities we held national fundraising days promoted give as you earn and shared virtual volunteering opportunities to support local charities and communities facing the impact of the pandemic our employees health and wellbeing are vital and we work hard to ensure we are supporting them with both their physical and mental health whether working at home or at one of our sites will gardiner ceo supporting our communities we have sought to help our communities during the covid19 pandemic laptops for learners our laptops for learners initiative provided 853 laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access to over 50 schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk the initiative has enabled students at our partner schools in england and scotland to continue to access lessons from home online educational resources we launched an online offering to make sure students were able to continue learning this included creating virtual tours of our assets and educational content delivering webinars to university students and providing a virtual experience of work in partnership with oak national academy this donation of laptops from drax is going to make a huge difference to the lives of pupils currently without access to online educational resources  as well as our whole school community after the coronavirus lockdown is over ian clennan head teacher of selby community primary school supporting our customers throughout the year we continued the vital supply of power to around 300000 uk businesses including organisations most affected by the pandemic such as care homes hospitals schools and retailers debt support we focused on providing extra help for our customers facing financial hardship due to covid19 we retrained call centre colleagues to equip them with the skills needed to help prevent debt and to connect businesses with the support they might need including access to governmentbacked loans and expert financial help we created options for smaller businesses and organisations struggling at this time for those unable to keep their accounts in balance or pay in full we created deferred payment plans we also extended current energy prices for three months to 4000 customers coming to the end of their contracts giving those businesses an opportunity to focus on more pressing concerns related to covid19 we donated 150000 to the specialist debt charity business debtline the funds are being used to set up and run a dedicated webpage and phoneline for our sme referrals over the next two years this will help businesses recover from the crisis and aims to support their longterm security care homes we provided free gas and electricity for two months to 162 independent care homes local to draxs operations across the uk this payment freeze allowed these vital organisations to divert funds to other priorities such as ppe food and carers accommodation not having to pay our energy bills for two months means we can redistribute our funds to buy essential items like ppe to ensure our employees are supported to give our residents the level of care they deserve mike smith chief operating officer of shaw healthcare system stability why is there a growing importance for system support services keeping the lights on requires not just electricity generation but also a range of nongeneration activities which help provide stability flexibility and reliability to ensure that electricity supply meets demand secondbysecond electricity must be transported the length of the country and levels of generation must be managed so they are exactly equal to levels being used ie balanced and properties like voltage and frequency must be minutely regulated across the whole network ensuring all this happens smoothly relies on the system operator  national grid  working with power generators like drax to provide services in addition to power generation that keep the power system in operation stable and balanced we call these system support services examples of system support services historically coal and gasfired power stations were able to deliver these services as an inherent byproduct of producing reliable baseload electricity now coal and older gas plants are being closed down in the uk and being replaced by intermittent renewable energy sources principally wind this reduces carbon emissions but makes the provision of these system support services more challenging wind by its nature is intermittent and for the most part unable to provide system support services whilst solar generation may be more predictable than wind it does not provide any system support services as demand for system support services increases there are fewer assets such as large power stations able to provide them see table 1 below this is increasing the cost of operating the system and is a growing source of value for generators like drax which can provide these services frequency response  the automatic change in generation output or in demand to maintain a system frequency of 50hz frequency response is required every second of the day voltage controlreactive power mvars  reactive power is used to manage power flows around the transmission system and helps to support voltage in the event of a system fault inertia  the stored energy in synchronous generators ie large spinning mass such as a biomass or pumped storage turbine which slow down the rate of changes in system frequency black start  the ability of a generation unit to start up without external electricity supplies following a total or partial loss of power from the transmission system reserve  the system operator must be able to ensure a balance between demand and generation at all times to prevent power cuts this increased and decreased generation is sometimes referred to as headroom and footroom managing demand can also be used to the same effect as we become more dependent on intermittent renewables we believe that the system operator will require more dispatchable plant like biomass and pumped storage which can turn up when wind speed drops and crucially turn down when wind speeds are high pumped storage is particularly useful as in addition to providing a full range of generation and nongeneration services to the system operator it allows largescale wind generation to be stored as hydroelectricity at times of excess electricity production by using energy from excess wind generation to pump the water to storage before releasing it back into the electricity grid when required by way of comparison cruachan power station is four times as big as the worlds largest battery and can run at full load for fifteen hours generation type biomass pumped storage gas hydro nuclear solar

partial cruachan power station scotland system support services and drax drax operates a portfolio of flexible renewable and lowcarbon generation which is able to provide all of these services as demand for these services increases drax is able to contract with the system operator national grid to provide a range of nongeneration services such as a sixyear contract worth up to 5 million per year awarded to cruachan for the provision of inertia in western scotland the contract does not require cruachan to produce electricity but to be synchronised with the electricity system drax also makes its assets available in the shortterm balancing mechanism to help national grid balance the system on a minute byminute and hourbyhour basis we are remunerated for system support services via the balancing mechanism specific bilateral contracts for ancillary services with the system operator we monitor our performance by measuring the gross profit earned from these activities which we describe as system support optimisation system support services are principally delivered through generation but we also have a growing opportunity to provide some of these services through our customers business we provide electricity to large and industrial customers in addition to smes working with these larger customers to manage their usage throughout the day we expect to provide demandside response services to the electricity market  for example by reducing demand at times of lower supply and vice versa the chart below shows the value derived from system support services and optimisation gross profit m giving customers control of their energy how are we supporting our customers in addition to providing our customers with renewable energy we provide them with the opportunity to control and optimise their energy use cost and source and this helps us in supporting the energy system demandside response drax is a leading provider of renewable energy and services to industrial and commercial customers haven powers large portfolio of industrial and commercial customers offers opportunities to provide system support services to the energy market and create value for our customers in november 2019 united utilities became the first customer to sign up to haven powers asset flex project known as demand side response dsr customers are provided with financial incentives to turn down or turn off nonessential equipment at times of peak demand depending on the customers needs the latest customer to sign up for this service is sundown products a large industrial site with a range of heavy machinery providing another new type of asset to control as haven look to broaden their portfolio and knowledge base across different technologies haven uses technology to turn down or turn off customers energy demand in peak times to reduce their costs and is designed to always work within the constraints set by the customer for example we could turn off a water pump within certain limits or time shift a production line it is simple for the customer drax has the opportunity to create value from the asset in the provision of system support services and in exchange customers get a cheaper unit rate reducing demand typically at peak times which are also periods of higher carbon intensity is another way in which the group is providing system support services to the uk power system electric vehicles evs drax has developed a solution aimed at making it easier for companies especially those with fleets to transition to evs ses water was the first partner to take this bespoke package which includes vehicle suitability assessment charging infrastructure operating software vehicle telematics maintenance services and the renewable electricity needed to power the vehicles our energy expertise enables us to approach the challenge of electrification from a different angle considering onsite energy requirements and deploying smart charging technology that delivers cost and environmental benefits without negatively affecting businessasusual the aim is to deliver ev charging and battery optimisation which ties into our customer control strategy by understanding all aspects of evs from telematics to chargepoint hardware and software we are identifying opportunities to create value for customers and the group you can read more about this on our electrification for business website wwwenergydraxcom battery power energy storage through batteries is also being tested with customers who already generate renewable energy onsite energy storage is the key to helping customers maximise the benefit of the energy they generate from their own smallscale renewables providing greater flexibility to the grid and smoothing volatility in the system drax has partnered with energy storage company eaton which offers new and secondlife batteries such as used ev batteries for installations on customer sites eaton can quickly scaleup the deployment of small commercial energy storage systems to larger industrialscale units helping to support more customers with energy management solutions engaging our stakeholders why is engaging with our stakeholders fundamental to our success we recognise that we need to listen to and work with a diverse range of interested parties to achieve our purpose to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future the quality of the groups decision making is richer when we actively consider the views of stakeholders from our shareholders to our colleagues and from environmental ngos engos to regulators we recognise that our decisions have an impact far beyond our business we proactively seek to understand the needs of our stakeholders and act upon them to better deliver our purpose to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future stakeholder relations the world around us is evolving rapidly and the expectations on the business are changing too more than ever before our role in supporting our stakeholders is central to our strategy from tackling climate change to responding to covid19 to levelling up the economy our aim is to be a force for positive change in the communities where we operate and in addressing some of the major global challenges affecting us all we recognise that delivering longterm value for our shareholders and customers is closely linked to delivering good outcomes for our climate environment and communities these factors continue to drive changes in regulation policy and public attitudes therefore drax takes great care to anticipate and respond effectively to the changing world to that end the views of all our stakeholders forms a core part of the decisionmaking process of the board and the group drax has a wide range of stakeholders and takes care to ensure that the group and the board has an effective strategy to identify and engage with them the board receives regular reports on stakeholder engagement including from the corporate affairs and investor relations functions this ensures that the board takes into account the views of our stakeholders when making strategic decisions draxs communications strategy contains our stakeholder engagement plan presented to the board at least annually this sets out and provides oversight of how the group intends to engage stakeholders in addition the board engages with key communications campaigns to better understand the needs of those stakeholders that our campaigns are targeting we employ dedicated teams to engage both proactively and reactively with specific stakeholder groups our teams include stakeholder relations strategic communications investor relations hr internal relations sustainable business business ethics media relations and digital engagement the methods of engagement we use vary according to the issue and the stakeholder concerned as drax changes and grows we expect the scope and breadth of our engagement with different stakeholders to also evolve the following pages 40 to 45 set out the broad stakeholder groups we identified and engaged with in 2020 it also highlights their key concerns why and how we engaged and how we responded companies act section 172 statement the directors have a duty to promote the success of the company having regard to a range of matters and stakeholders the board recognises that decisions taken today will shape both the longerterm performance of the business and its impact on our various stakeholders the board is responsible for engagement with a range of stakeholders and believes that considering the interests of our stakeholders in key business decisions is fundamental to the groups ability to deliver sustainable value creation this consideration enables drax to have a positive impact on the environment our communities and wider society over the longer term the following pages explain how during 2020 the board had regard to those matters set out in section 172 of the companies act 2006 on pages 40 to 45 we set out the boards and more widely the groups comprehensive engagement with stakeholders on pages 61 to 63 we describe how we seek to maintain our high standards of business conduct on page 88 we describe how the board responded to the covid19 pandemic including decisions taken to support the workforce and wider community on pages 90 and 91 we describe the boards leadership of stakeholder engagement including a focus on board decisionmaking and stakeholder and longterm considerations on page 92 we describe the boards engagement with the workforce on pages 32 and 33 we describe the boards oversight of tcfd and climaterelated risks and in sustainable business on pages 48 to 63 we describe the impact of the companys operations on the environment and the community understanding the needs of our stakeholders is essential to our longterm success engagement takes place at many levels of the business and a judgement is made on a casebycase basis on whether engagement is required by the board executive committee senior management or at the operational level the group head of public affairs maintains a detailed map of key stakeholders both internal and external the concerns theyve raised and the date of the last meeting management keeps under review the relevant stakeholders that may be affected by major decisions to ensure clear feedback the board receives regular reports from the ceo on key stakeholder relations activity current issues and the relevant feedback received from stakeholder interaction these reports are supported by the group director of corporate affairs the corporate affairs team and the relevant owners of direct stakeholder engagement the board has a duty to promote the success of the company as set out in section 172 of the companies act 2006 supporting this board and executive committee discussions  and accompanying papers  include information on the stakeholders likely to be affected by items under discussion and the likely impact this ensures that the interests of all relevant stakeholders and the need to act fairly between members of the company are considered in decisionmaking the most recent detailed review of stakeholder activities was presented to the executive committee and the board in october 2020 our stakeholders key concerns beyond coal strategy diversity and inclusion response to covid19

want all employees to feel they can grow develop and make a meaningful contribution to our strategy purpose and communities whilst building resilience to cope with the context in which we are operating how we engage we maintain regular dialogue with our workforce through our engagement myvoice forums colleague briefings weekly updates and qa from our ceo and our pulse and annual engagement surveys launched in 2019 the myvoice forums align to our operating model and forums representing each of the business areas each forum comprises sufficient colleague representatives relative to the size of the business and meet formally each quarter and informally as regularly as each forum feels is appropriate for local needs representatives are drawn from across the relevant business unit and each forum chair has been selected by membership vote the chairs of each forum come together quarterly to discuss workforce issues across the business and discuss topics where workforce feedback has been sought by the board the chairs then meet with the chair of the board of directors and ceo to discuss the key issues raised with feedback from these meetings then shared with all forum members matters discussed during 2020 included diversity and inclusion how effectively our covid19 response was communicated colleague wellbeing in lockdown and how colleagues would prefer to work in future employees are also able anonymously to ask questions of the ceo ask will on any subject the ceo responds to the latest questions in his weekly email to all colleagues where he also shares his thoughts and highlights of the week how weve responded weve listened to and acted on feedback from both the myvoice forums and other colleague interactions more broadly this included introducing informal and formal flexible working policies and a working from home policy and guidance developing our diversity and inclusion strategy developing and delivering plans to further support colleague wellbeing including a dedicated intranet resource mental health awareness training for managers building resilience elearning for all colleagues raising further awareness of existing wellbeing benefits available and a step challenge to encourage physical fitness and virtual social connection and creating a dedicated intranet resource to clarify the latest guidance and information about covid19 in 2020 employees asked over 1300 questions in ask will subjects ranged from employees enquiring about the strategy and challenging the ceo so they could gain a deeper understanding of what we do and plan to do to what drax is doing to help tackle climate change what employees can do individually and wills own views other topics included areas of concern around the business mental health and wellbeing pay and benefits around the group and new or innovative ideas examples of action taken as a result of ask will questions include increasing our cyclescheme limit to 2000 as part of our voluntary benefits offering our ceo making a statement about black lives matter and doing more to embed diversity and inclusion through people stories following the coal closure announcement consultation on all key areas was undertaken with trade unions and employee representatives feedback from this process was considered allowing the board to assess the process undertaken to date and consider further measures to be implemented for example resulting in changes and enhancements to the financial and retraining packages we also strengthened our health and safety function with the recruitment of a new role of group hse director you can read more about our activities on pages 58 to 61 and 92 of the report pdf engaging with stakeholders engaging stakeholders through a new approach to negative emissions there is scientific consensus that to get to net zero emissions we need to address emissions from key sectors that cannot decarbonise as much or as fast as others examples include aviation heavy industry and agriculture this means that in addition to our efforts to reduce emissions we also need to invest in technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere leading expert bodies such as the climate change committee royal society royal academy of engineering and the electricity system operator recognise that these technologies will play a crucial role in getting to net zero in 2020 the group engaged with a range of stakeholders on the role of biomass and negative emissions in the energy transition and a postcovid19 green recovery the stakeholders included government local mps leaders in industry and business ngos think tanks and academics the groups ceo will gardiner played a key role in leading the debate on negative emissions climate change and the importance of draxs role in the energy transition he highlighted our plans to combine sustainable biomass with beccs which the international energy agency recently described as the most mature of carbon capture technologies reflecting the crosssectoral need for negative emissions technologies a broad group of companies and industry bodies launched the coalition for negative emissions in october 2020 the coalition ranges from farming to aviation and represents hundreds of thousands of workers across some of the uks most critical industries the coalition jointly wrote to the uk government outlining a shared vision to build back better from covid19 as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery enabling the fulfilment of this vision is the development of pioneering projects that can remove carbon from the atmosphere drax has also been championing the potential of the humber region to lead a green industrial revolution including by deploying beccs at drax a study by consultancy vivid economics november 2020 commissioned by drax revealed that tens of thousands of jobs could be created and supported in the humber region to make this happen cutting edge carbon capture and hydrogen technologies need to be deployed to decarbonise industry and deliver a zero carbon humber with the right policy framework these new jobs could begin to be realised as soon as 2024 developing beccs at drax could support thousands of jobs at its peak including in construction supply chain and the wider economy this could kickstart a new carbon capture and hydrogen industry in the uk the prime ministers ten point plan for a green industrial revolution published in november 2020 increased support for carbon capture and storage projects and accelerated timeframes for delivery it also recognised the role of carbon capture and storage in helping decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions in addition it acknowledged the

thirds of draxs supplies the analysis evaluates the trends occurring in the forestry sector around the plant to determine what impact the pellet demand may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this includes the impact on harvesting levels carbon stock growth rate wood prices forest management practices and the production of all wood products in the geographies examined so far data collected through our catchment area analyses provides robust evidence that we are meeting our forest biomass sustainability commitments for key findings and our catchment area analysis reports see wwwdraxcomsustainabilitycatchmentareaanalyses our intention is to complete catchment area analyses for the remaining supply areas within the next two years healthy forest landscapes drax is jointly pioneering the healthy forest landscapes hfl approach with earthworm foundation earthworm is a nonprofit organisation that focuses on responsible sourcing and is experienced in working with companies to develop landscapescale approaches in commodity supply chains hfl aims to provide an evidencebased approach to measure and evaluate the ecological social and economic impacts in our supply catchment areas the hfl approach measures changes in the forest landscape using empirical evidence such as big data from government statistics and input from remote sensing technologies such as earth observation from satellites hfl also uses an earthwormdeveloped socioeconomic evaluation methodology to assess community wellbeing the hfl approach assesses four key metrics  forest cover carbon stock biodiversity and community wellbeing  which will be used across all our sourcing areas healthy forest landscapes metrics forest cover all other forest landscape attributes depend upon forest cover so particular attention is paid to trends in forest cover change carbon stock carbon sequestration and storage in forests is critical to mitigating climate change and therefore crucial to track measurement of forest carbon stock also provides a useful picture of forests continuing productivity biodiversity landscape scale biodiversity is an important indicator of healthy forest ecosystem functioning and is of concern to both local and international stakeholders community wellbeing forests have many impacts on people who live and work within the landscape this metric addresses social aspects of forest landscape health prioritising respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and includes socioeconomic and community health encompassing industry workers rights the hfl approach enables drax to actively identify opportunities to make positive interventions which support healthy forests communities or biodiversity in 2020 we trialled several methodologies to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each of the four key metrics we completed analysis around our own plants at amite and morehouse and commenced analysis in the chesapeake catchment in virginia over the next four years we aim to roll out the hfl approach across all our wood source catchment areas ultimately this will allow drax to track and report our specific and aggregate impact on the four key metrics of forest landscape health in a timely and transparent manner independent advisory board our independent advisory board iab of scientists academics and forestry experts is led by professor sir john beddington former chief scientific adviser to the uk government the iab provides independent advice on feedstock options forest science optimisation of carbon impacts and the role of biomass in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system the advice and scrutiny from the iab means our stakeholders can be assured that drax will keep our sustainability and responsible sourcing policies under review and that the biomass we use follows the latest scientific research and best practice in 2020 the iab had five meetings and discussed topics including draxs carbon negative ambition the scalability and feasibility of beccs and our forest catchment area analyses the iab commissioned two independent pieces of work to inform them  a literature review on the impacts of bioenergy on biodiversity and a literature review on global carbon accounting methodologies which were discussed during the year we publish the iabs recommendations to drax on our website for more information see w wwdraxcomsustainabilityindependentadvisoryboardonsustainablebiomass people positive our ambition is to improve skills education employability and

in accordance with the uk corporate governance code 2018 the directors have assessed the prospects of the group over a period significantly longer than the 12 months required by the going concern provision the assessment of viability was led by the ceo and cfo in conjunction with divisional and functional management teams and presented to the board as part of the annual planning process in reviewing this assessment the board has considered the principal risks faced by the group relevant financial forecasts and sensitivities the availability of adequate funding and the strength of the groups control environment assessment period the board conducted this assessment over a period of three years 2019 three years selected for the following reasons the groups business plan the plan which is prepared annually updated three times during the year and also used for strategic decisionmaking includes a range of financial forecasts and associated sensitivity analysis this plan covers a threeyear period in detail before extending into the medium term within the threeyear period liquid commodity market curves and established contract positions are used in the forecasts liquid curves typically cover a one to twoyear window and contracts cover periods between one and ten years in particular the group benefits from the stable and material earnings stream available from the cfd until 2027 selecting a threeyear period balances shortterm market liquidity against longerterm contractual positions there is limited certainty around the groups markets and regulatory regimes however in selecting a threeyear period the board has assumed no material changes to the mediumterm regulatory environment and associated support regimes beyond those already announced at the date of this report the business considers longer term forecasts for other purposes including value in use analyses and estimates of useful economic lives in respect of its businesses and fixed assets as set out in the notes to the financial statements review of principal risks the groups principal risks and uncertainties set out in detail on pages 66 to 77 have been considered over the period the principal risks with the potential to exert significant influence on viability are commodity price changes political and regulatory changes and plant operating failures a significant adverse change to the status of each risk has the potential to place material financial stress on the group the risks were evaluated where possible to assess the potential impact of each on the viability of the group should that risk arise in its unmitigated form the potential inputs were included where appropriate as sensitivities to the plan and considered by the board as part of the approval process in january 2021 before the plan was adopted by the group in addition reasonable scenarios that included a combination of unforeseen plant outages increases in commodity prices and reductions in subsidy income were also considered the outcomes of this analysis which did not reflect the potential benefit of available mitigating actions indicated that the group would be able to absorb the impact of such scenarios without significant impact upon its ability to meet liabilities as they fall due as part of its review of principal risks and uncertainties the group considered emerging risks related to covid19 the end of the brexit transition period and climate change this review concluded that such matters remained low risk to the group from a viability perspective the boards response to covid19 during 2020 is described in further detail on page 88 the group has a proven track record of rapidly adapting to changes to its environment and deploying innovative solutions to protect its financial performance previous adverse events have arisen and provided challenges which tested the ability of the group to deliver on its targets but on each occasion it has been able to respond positively and manage the impact this provides the board with further confidence that risks can be sufficiently mitigated and viability can be maintained during the assessment period review of financial forecasts the plan considers the groups financial position performance cash flows credit metrics and other key financial ratios and was most recently updated to reflect current market and external environment conditions in december 2020 including assumptions related to the ongoing impact of covid19 it is built by business and segment and includes growth assumptions appropriate to the markets each business serves the plan includes certain assumptions the most material of which relate to commodity market price curves and levels of subsidy support available to the group through the generation of biomassfuelled renewable power it is underpinned by the stable revenues available through the generation of cfdbacked electricity and contracted sales from the customers business the plan is subject to stress testing which involves the construction of reasonably foreseeable scenarios including those aligned to the principal risks described above which test the robustness of the plan when key variables are flexed both individually and in unison where such a scenario suggests a risk to viability the availability and quantum of mitigating actions is considered as part of stresstesting the plan a reasonable worst case scenario was also constructed and assessed rather than a single event the board considers the most significant scenario that could reasonably arise in the assessment period and materially impact viability to be an aggregation of multiple incidents either in a short timeframe or repeatedly during the period for the purpose of creating the scenario the severity of these incidents for example the duration of an unexpected outage was based on experience of actual historical events or reasonably foreseeable future downside scenarios the reasonable worst case considered the impact on earnings cash flow and net leverage as a result of a series of incidents including unexpected generation outages pellet production outages a reasonable reduction in customers gross margin increases in commodity prices and a loss of roc income during the period whilst the outcomes from this scenario were severe they indicated that the group would continue to operate within the restrictions of its financing arrangements and would have sufficient cash to meet its liabilities as they fall due once likely mitigating actions were taken into account such mitigating actions included potentially reducing levels of capital expenditure and dividend payments if required the impact would also be partially mitigated through the earnings stability provided by the cfd the groups proven ability to trade effectively in volatile markets use of existing committed and undrawn facilities and reductions in other discretionary expenditure based on its review the board is satisfied the viability of the group would be preserved in a range of scenarios with various mitigating actions available sufficient to manage the risk including significant deterioration of commodity market prices availability of adequate funding the sources of funding available to the group are set out in note 43 to the financial statements page 184 the board expects these sources along with stable cash flows generated by the group from its normal operations to provide adequate levels of funding to support the execution of the groups plan during 2020 the group issued 250 million of loan notes and entered into a new infrastructure term loan facilities agreement with committed funds in both sterling 450 million and euro 1265 million with an option to increase by up to a further 750 million at the year end the loan notes were drawn in full and a further 315 million and 530 million drawn under the infrastructure facilities the proceeds of these issuances were along with existing cash flows used to redeem the groups 350 million 2022 sterling bond and the 125 million esg term loan facility these arrangements both extended the maturity profile of the groups debt and reduced the overall cost of debt further strengthening the balance sheet no significant repayments of debt fall due within the assessment period in addition the group completed the refinancing of its revolving credit facility the new 300 million facility matures in 2025 with an option to extend by one year this replaces the previous rcf which was due to mature in 2021 and provides increased liquidity with the full facility now able to be drawn as cash the previous facility restricted cash drawn to support liquidity to 165 million at 31 december 2020 the group had total cash and committed facilities of 682 million the plan demonstrates that the group expects to operate within its current committed facilities for the duration of the threeyear viability period the board is confident that the group has access to a range of options to maintain a diverse and wellbalanced capital structure expectations the directors have considered a range of factors in their assessment of viability over the next three years including the latest plan scenario analysis levels of funding the control environment and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group the directors have also considered the availability of actions within their control in the event of plausible negative scenarios occurring based on this the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the threeyear period of their assessment principal risks and uncertainties the effective management of risk supports the delivery of our strategy identifying assessing and managing risks across the group is an integral part of the delivery of our strategy we manage the commercial and operational risks faced by the group in accordance with policies and processes approved by the board the board is responsible for determining risk appetite and ensuring the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls across the group the group has a comprehensive system of governance controls to manage all key risks group approach to risk management the risk appetite is the level of risk that the group is prepared to tolerate and which might arise in the daytoday conduct of our business and seeking to realise our strategic objectives risk appetite can vary depending on the nature of the risk and expected returns risk appetite also informs the expected behaviours from our employees contractors and business partners and the investment required to support risk management activities we consider a range of risk categories including environment people health and safety political and regulatory strategic operational financial and climate change the board determines the risk appetite of the group and seeks to ensure that emerging and existing risks are identified and managed to increase the likelihood that the groups business objectives will be achieved the group has a risk management policy approved by the board which defines its approach to risk management the key elements of the policy are to identify risks that have the potential to threaten the achievement of our strategic objectives and assess the likelihood of the risk occurring using a risk scoringmethodology which ensures a consistent approach when assessing all risks consider the possible impact to the business in the event of any risks arising and put in place appropriate mitigating controls intended to manage identified risks to an acceptable level assign responsibility and define accountabilities for the identification assessment and management of risk and provide resources to enable appropriate measures to be taken provide a framework to enable the escalation and reporting on potential and emerging risks and the effectiveness of the mitigations and controls to support management decision making regularly monitor changes in the internal and external environment of our business review the groups principal risks against such changes to ensure our analysis remains accurate and relevant and review the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and the application of the risk framework employed the risk management approach manages rather than eliminates the risk of failure to achieve strategic and business objectives and provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss risk management governance the risk management governance structure includes the executive committee from which are identified the owners accountable for each principal risk and our risk management committees whose shared responsibilities include ensuring that risks including new potential and emerging risks are identified assessed and managed effectively within defined risk appetites and limits ensuring that risks associated with the groups principal risk categories are identified analysed and managed appropriately ensuring that changes in the internal business and external macro environment that affect the principal risks are kept under review and responded to appropriately driving completion of the actions required to reduce risk exposure and improve risk mitigation driving an appropriate risk management culture that promotes and creates balanced risktaking behaviour and clear accountability demonstrating robust governance of risk management by reviewing and challenging risk management across the group in line with good governance the risk management committees undertake regular reviews of business unit and financial risks and receive reports from business units and risk owners reflecting their specialist areas and technical knowledge the executive committee also undertake deep dive reviews of all the principal risks through the course of the year and receive reports from the risk management committees and principal risk owners in addition the audit committee and board review the suitability and effectiveness of risk management processes and controls on behalf of the board and receive updates from management at each meeting the board also receives updates on the risk management framework internal control the group has a welldefined internal control system supported by policies and procedures documented levels of authority which support decisionmaking and accountability for management across the group the board has adopted a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it for a decision below which authority is delegated through the executive committee to a combination of subcommittees and management enabling them to make decisions on behalf of the group and its businesses on a daytoday basis the most recent review of the schedule of matters by the board was in december 2020 the internal control system is designed to ensure that the directors and executive maintain effective oversight and direction for all material strategic operational financial and organisational issues under authority delegated by the board the audit committee approves and implements a programme of internal audits covering various aspects of the groups activities for the next financial year the programme evolves based on an assessment of the key risks of the group the existing assurance and controls in place to manage the risks the core financial control framework and observations arising from managements review discussion and challenge by the audit committee including responses to findings from the observations arising from the work of the internal audit function and support of other specialist advisers the programme is reviewed quarterly and refreshed to reflect developments within the group as well as changes in wider practices informed by the experience of internal and external personnel during 2020 internal audits were performed either by team members of the groups internal audit function or with effect from july 2020 by kpmg who was formerly the groups cosource internal audit function provider the internal audit function reports to the cfo and the appointment of kpmg was considered and approved by the audit committee the findings and recommendations from each internal audit are documented in a report for internal distribution and action a full copy of the report is distributed to the executive committee and the audit committee each report includes the status of management responses to the findings and recommendations and details of the actions that management propose to take each meeting of the executive committee considers the status of closing recommended actions in addition the audit committee receives a full internal audit and quarterly internal controls update report at each meeting based on the assessments undertaken by each of the executive committee and the audit committee during 2020 and considered at the meeting of the board held in finalising the annual report and accounts the board determined that it was not aware of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal control for further information on the work of the audit committee see page 98 overall risk assessment the board has assessed the principal risk categories including assessing continued emerging risks arising from the unexpected events of the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty experienced during the year concerned with brexit as an immediate response to the pandemic the group deployed its disaster recovery arrangements which facilitated assessment of the potential impact and subsequent monitoring of mitigation measures as the appreciation of key issues and challenges matured the initial crisis threat was deescalated and actions were monitored through established teams throughout the year particular attention was given to ensure the group remained as materially unaffected by possible brexit outcomes including a no deal exit from the eu any additional change in managing these and other new and emerging risks has not materially affected the categorisation of the groups principal risks therefore the nine principal risk categories disclosed on pages 69 to 77 remain unchanged from 2019 when climate change was added as a principal risk reflecting the increasing medium to longer term focus on such risks and their importance to the groups strategy and the nature of the groups sector and operations risk impact of covid19 the ongoing covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an impact on the global economy our customers suppliers and the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors the group prioritises health safety and wellbeing and has put in place a number of actions and additional measures to safeguard all those who are still required to attend the groups operational sites this includes the group ensuring it remains cognisant of any continual changing guidelines issued by the uk government and us authorities all of the actions implemented enabled the group to meet its obligations as part of the uks critical national infrastructure generating power and supporting the uks energy market and our business customers while protecting our employees the group has an incident crisis management process enabling timely response to events when they occur which comprises of strategic led by the executive committee in addition to tactical and operational level teams led by management in response to covid19 these teams developed and implemented additional policies and procedures around health safety it systems remote working practices wellbeing communications and engagement in response to the continual changing environment created by the pandemic constant monitoring of these plans and their effectiveness is being undertaken since the start of the pandemic and as it has evolved the board has received regular reports from management and supported critical decisions connected with the groups response to the events and activities as outlined above this has included for example how the group has adjusted its working practices across all of its operation sites its communication strategy with and on safeguarding its employees implementing new it infrastructure to support changes in working practices away from offices and being able to continue to accurately track its financial and nonfinancial business performance the board also received reports on how covid19 might impact risks in the medium to longer term enabling them to reassess the future impact on all of the groups principal risks further details on how the group responded to the pandemic is detailed in the section our covid19 response on pages 34 and 35 the impact of covid19 on each principal risk and the mitigating actions adopted in response to the risk are detailed on pages 69 to 77 and the changes arising from covid19 are denoted by the covid19 symbol the group has kept under review its financial forecasts and its best estimates of the financial impact of the associated risks which were initially disclosed in the trading update issued in april 2020 and thereafter in the half year results the initial analysis has remained broadly unchanged in terms of the impact on the group for the 2020 financial year and is fully reflected in its viability statement see page 64 additional information on the commercial and financial impact for the group of covid19 during the 2020 financial year can be found on pages 20 to 27 the board recognise that going forward the effects of the covid19 pandemic continues to carry inherent uncertainties and future impacts may well continue to evolve even when events have returned to relative normality these impacts could lead to further change in uk government policy macroeconomic policy and the behaviours of people and markets that may impact some of the groups risks the board continues to have regular engagement with management on the groups response to any of these risks in order to assess monitor and promptly respond to any evolving impact of covid19 on our operations and business including impacts for all our stakeholders risk impact of brexit throughout 2020 the group continued to monitor and prepare for the uks customs exit from the eu including managing for a no deal brexit an internal working group consisting of relevant management chaired by a member of the executive committee regularly reviewed developments in negotiations and possible effects on the groups activities this included updating the executive committee and board on brexit risks and initiatives to mitigate the impact from a range of possible negotiation outcomes that continually changed during the transition period while operating under the withdrawal agreement until the 24 december 2020 when the ukeuropean union free trade agreement fta was officially announced throughout the eu exit process drax held chairmanship of the energy uk trade association brexit working group which undertook regular meetings attended by various uk government organisations post the transition period management directly and through its association with energy uk have continued to monitor closely the release and interpretation of further details relating to the fta in order that we can look to clarify fully the potential impacts on our trading operations supply chain and regulatory requirements the groups ongoing focus will be to ensure that our business mitigates any adverse effects to its operations from the fta and it has put in place a number of actions and measures to manage risks it identified around a number of key areas these included considering the finance and commodity trading risks from potential restrictions in access to financial carbon renewable energy guarantee of origin certificates goos and commodity markets the group developed contingency plans to respond to the revised approach to carbon trading post 1 january 2021 to allow it to effectively meet the groups regulatory requirements relating to carbon there were also preparations to ensure the groups ability to secure and continue to trade renewable energy goos as well as operations to manage its other financial and commodity exposures such as fx effectively from 1 january 2021 the group is adapting to the post fta environment particularly with close monitoring of the detailed implementation of uk allowances including possible linkage to the eu emissions trading scheme ets considering the people risks from potential constraints in free movement of people and access to talent further consideration and planning have been placed on groupwide recruitment and retention talent management and succession planning considering the risks from potential import constraints and tariffs on the groups fuel and critical commodity supply an operational review considered alternative port arrangements a review of goods at risk of shortage and planning for key plant operations supplies this included engaging with supply chain partners to ensure their brexit readiness and managing for increased supply lead times other potential import risks associated with uk government policy arose as a result of covid19 where the need to give priority to the importing of other products such as medicines and the closing of french ports to uk import and export freight increased the potential to add further congestion and delays to the import of critical spares and commodities considering potential changes to regulation and policy and the risks from loss of engagement with europeanbased stakeholders to discuss emerging policy and understand potential divergence of compliance requirements andor market rules the group continues to promote the benefits of biomass and is engaged with government regulators and other interest groups both in the uk and internationally this is to ensure our views and positions on current and forthcoming legislation regulations energy and environmental policy issues that may have implications for our business are represented and that we are able to listen to and consider the views of others in helping to reach consensus on the future for biomass generally the overall financial and nonfinancial risk impact to the group of brexit to date has been minimal however the above key risk areas still remain a focus of the group while the uk government continues to develop plans to manage the longerterm economic effects of covid19 there is additionally future uncertainty about any additional economic effects which may result from the implementation of the fta on our customers suppliers and other stakeholders for these reasons the group will continue to monitor any potential change to brexit risks during 2021 as the full interpretation and implementation of the fta takes place and where necessary expects to update its mitigating actions to minimise any effects on business operations principal risk categories the group has identified nine principal risk categories that it considers having material operational impact and probability to its business these and other key risks are considered within an established programme by which management executive and the board consider how risk and our ability to respond to risks
