Refurbishing a 300-tonne generator core within the heart of a power station
6 December 2017
Power generation

At the centre of Drax Power Station, in a corner of the cavernous turbine hall, is a white box. The inside of this box is spotlessly clean. Not only are its white walls free of dirt, they are free of even dust. But there is one outlier inside this sterile environment: a 300-tonne chunk of industrial equipment.
This equipment is a generator core – the central component for converting the mechanical energy to electrical power.
The core is driven by the steam turbine. Ninety tonnes of generator rotor spinning at 3,000 rpm with just millimetres of clearance from the core produce 660 megawatts (MW) of electricity. That’s enough – 645 MW when
exported from Drax into the National Grid
– to power a city the size of Sheffield.
The generator is a serious piece of industrial machinery. And despite the pristine conditions, this white box is the site of serious engineering.
A process normally done by large-scale manufacturers in dedicated factories, ‘rewinding’ a generator core – as the process is called – is a major operation.
No other UK facility is capable of doing this complex job. So it’s here, in a white box, in the middle of an operational power station in North Yorkshire, that a team of engineers is undertaking work that will secure the generator’s use for decades. This is the Drax rewinding facility.
How a generator works
A generator consists of two main components, a spinning rotor and a stationary stator. The rotor, which is directly connected to the main turbine and spins 50 times every second, sits inside the stator. Both the stator and the rotor contain a large number of copper coils known as windings. These windings are what carry the electrical current.
The rotor acts like a very strong electromagnet, which, when a voltage is applied, produces a strong magnetic field. Because the rotor sits inside the stator, this magnetic field intersects the copper windings of the stator and induces a voltage in these windings, allowing current to flow.  This voltage is then brought out of the stator and passed through a step-up transformer, where it is increased to a level suitable for transmission through the National Grid.
The stator core is made from many elements with hundreds of thousands of laminations, 84 water-cooled insulated copper bars, each 11 metres long and weighing 200kg forming the windings, various insulating materials, blocks, packing, wedges and condition monitoring equipment.
Generator stators can operate for decades without fault.
DIY at Drax
In 2016, a team of engineers at Drax embarked on a project to construct a facility to rewind the stator on site. This required cross-company collaborative working to design and construct this huge purpose built facility.
Contamination can cause operational problems, so the team built a sterile, white room within the turbine hall – one of just two places within the power station with foundations strong enough to support the incredible 450 tonnes required for the rewind facility. Designed to hold the stator core and the conductor bars, air is forced out of the room to limit the possibility of contamination to the core during the rewind.
“When the unit is in service it becomes magnetic, so any metallic particles left in the space will be attracted to the core,” explains Drax
electrical engineer
Thomas Walker. “Once magnetised, any metal particles could be drawn in, burrowing into the insulation and core lamination.”
This is the kind of event that an electricity generator wants to avoid – but when it happens, be prepared to fix it.
Roll with it
When Drax’s stators were manufactured in the 1980s, completing their construction relied on manual handling techniques. Modern day facilities, however, rotate the core to minimise human contact.
It took just six months for a partnership involving Drax,
Siemens
and
ENSER
to manufacture what could be the largest stator rollers in the world and within that time, ship them from the US to North Yorkshire.
With the rollers installed, the next step was to move in the core. Two of the turbine hall’s cranes, each capable of lifting 150 tonnes, were combined to lift it, hoisting the core onto the mechanical ‘roller’ within the rewind facility.
Once in place, the roller rotates the core, allowing for the copper conductor bars to be safely removed and inserted. Despite this mechanical help, the removing and replacing of each one is still at its heart a human job.
“We still need 10 men to physically move the conductor bars with lifting aids, which makes it not an easy process,” says Walker. Using this method, the bars weighing 200kg each can be safely and precisely fitted into the core.
Opting for in-house
Rewinding a stator is a complex process. However, when the time, logistics and costs of shipping the core to Siemens – the German-based manufacturers – was factored in, the decision to do the work at Drax Power Station was an easy one.
“
A 300-tonne core is not easy to transport and the Highways Agency do not like things like that on the roads. They’d want us to use waterways” says Drax
lead engineer
Mark Rowbottom. “Logistically it just wasn’t worth it. It’s too much money to move and ship that weight to Germany. So, we looked at what we could do onsite.”
More than just an economical and logistical decision and with the UK’s diminishing manufacturing facilities, Drax is now equipped to support generator rewinds for many years to come. Building and operating the rewind facility was a project that leveraged the engineering abilities of Drax employees. They are
increasingly doing engineering traditionally outsourced
to equipment manufacturers.
“The experience we have gained and the close working relationship we have established with Siemens enables us to support the generator for the remaining life of the station,” says Rowbottom.
“To see the core in that many pieces and stripped down to this level is very rare,” says Walker, who
began working at the plant as an apprentice
. Of the 84 conductor bars, half have been fitted, and the team is scheduled to complete the stator rewind in early 2018. “I never thought I’d do anything like this but am proud to say that I’ve done it.”

What will happen to the carbon price after 2020?
21 November 2017
Power generation

Great Britain’s electricity is cleaner than ever. As
wind, solar, biomass and hydro continue to make up more and more of our energy mix,
the power system edges ever closer to being entirely decarbonised. The GB power system has leapt up the big economies’
low carbon league table
from 20th in 2012 to seventh in 2016.
But this shift to lower-carbon power isn’t owed only to growing renewable electricity capacity. A fall in gas prices has helped and importantly, government policy has ensured coal power generation has become increasingly uneconomical vs electricity produced with gas (gas and coal compete for contracts to supply power to the National Grid).
Introduced in 2013, Great Britain’s
Carbon Price Floor sets the minimum price on carbon emissions
. A stricter policy than the EU’s volatile EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) which puts a much lower price on carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions, the Carbon Price Support as the British policy is also known tops up the EU ETS. Together, they have had a significant impact. According to
Aurora Energy Research, the Carbon Price Floor is a major factor in coal generation
emissions falling.
In Great Britain, the Carbon Price Floor (CPF) is currently capped at £18 per tonne of CO
2
and the EU ETS sits at around £5 t/CO
2
– meaning power generators and heavy industry pay around £23 t/CO
2
altogether. When initially formulated by the coalition government in 2010, it was intended the CPF would reach £30 per tonne by 2020 and £70 per tonne by 2030. However, the EU ETS has since fallen therefore the UK government chose to cap the carbon price support at
£18 per tonne
until 2020.
Now, as we reach the end of the decade, questions remain as to what will happen to this crucial mechanism post-2020. Will the government price coal off the system once and for all or will the fossil fuel make an
unlikely comeback
?
Four visions of carbon pricing’s future
In its research, Aurora has identified four potential future scenarios for the UK’s carbon pricing strategy.
Status Quo:
If the UK chooses to continue supporting the phase-out of coal and promotes low-carbon investment, the Carbon Price Floor will steadily increase post-2020, reaching an estimated £52 per tonne by 2040. In this scenario the UK’s carbon pricing structure remains about £18 per tonne higher than the EU ETS which is currently around £5 per tonne.
Catch-up:
In the post-Brexit landscape (whatever it may look like) the UK may choose to seek parity with the EU over decarbonisation. In this scenario, the total UK carbon price remains flat with EU ETS, which rises until convergence. In this scenario the UK and EU’s price per tonne of carbon reaches £35 by 2040.
Low Priced Carbon:
In the event that the UK government removes the carbon price from 2021 and the EU ETS never recovers beyond its 2017 level, the short-term effects could be a drop in the price of coal power and cheaper energy bills. CO
2
emissions increase in the UK as demand for power rises in the late 2020s and beyond (as recently witnessed
in the Netherlands where coal generation has increased
, in part, due to a low EU ETS). The expected price per tonne of carbon could be as low as £6 by 2040 and investment in lower carbon and renewable forms of power generation stalls.
High Priced Carbon:
In order to meet the UK’s fourth and fifth carbon budgets set by the Committee on Climate Change, this scenario sees the electricity system decarbonise more quickly, with coal removed as an energy source. The carbon price rises dramatically over the next two decades to hit £153 per tonne by 2040.
Stopping the coal comeback
Of these four scenarios, the steadily increasing prices of the Status Quo scenario could see the UK meet its power sector target within the
fourth carbon budget of 100 g CO
2
-eq/kWh  – achieving a 51% reduction from 1990 emission levels by 2030
. But Aurora found that keeping things as they are could see a radical swing the other way, some years earlier in its scenario: coal could make a comeback in the early 2020s.
In July this year, coal accounted for just 2% of electricity generation in Great Britain and
in 2016 as a whole it accounted for 9%
, producing the lowest amount of electricity since the start of World War II. Without solid growth of the Carbon Price Floor it could become a much more competitive fuel. This potential is further increased by a predicted rise in natural gas prices post-2020, when the current surplus of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is set to end.
If the government chooses not to set tough prices on carbon emissions, Aurora predicts that on average coal will account for 9% of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025 – a change in the declining coal power trend seen in recent years. A Low Carbon Price future would see coal grow to almost 12% of the total electricity generation mix during the same period.
By contrast, in the High Carbon Price scenario, coal is almost completely driven out of the energy system, accounting for an estimated 2% of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025.
Signalling to the future
What is crucial for British power generators at this stage is clarity beyond 2020, when the £18 per tonne cap ends. This can allow the industry to react to future carbon pricing and prepare for whatever future scenario the government is most likely to adopt.
If the government chooses to continue decarbonising the energy system in a significant way – as it should do – coal facilities can be converted to renewable or lower-carbon units, such as
biomass
or
gas
. New interconnectors, renewable sources, storage facilities and demand-side response will also need to be installed at a greater capacity to meet the energy system’s demands.
As the amount of low carbon generation continues to grow, it will increasingly be the marginal generator. This means that power stations such as
Drax’s biomass units, which run with an 87% lower carbon footprint compared to coal across their entire supply chain
, could be used to meet the last megawatt hour (MWh) of demand – and this would see the carbon price having a diminishing impact on the wholesale price of power.
As has already been shown, the
Carbon Price Floor is one of the most effective ways to reduce Great Britain’s electricity emissions
. But to continue this impressive progress, the government needs to use it appropriately to set a path towards a decarbonised future.
In October, Drax joined British energy company SSE, climate NGO Sandbag and others to write to Chancellor Philip Hammond, calling on him to back the Carbon Price Floor beyond 2020 and in doing so, provide certainty for businesses investing in lower carbon and renewable capacity.

What happened to Great Britain’s electricity over summer 2017
15 November 2017
Power generation

What a difference four years can make. Back in 2012 the carbon intensity of Great Britain’s electricity production was almost 600g per kWh (kilowatt hour). Jump forward to 2016 and this has halved to make Britain one of the least carbon-intense power systems in the world.
This good news comes from
Electric Insights
, a quarterly research paper on Britain’s power system, commissioned by Drax and written by Imperial College London academics. The latest report’s key finding is just how much Britain’s energy system has decarbonised compared to other nations.
Here is what the data from Q3 2017 tell us about Great Britain’s energy system today and how it will continue to change into the future.
Climbing the low carbon league tables
Comparing the electricity mix and carbon intensity of nations producing more than 100 TWh (terawatt hours) a year, the report has established a ‘league table’ that tracks the progress (or regress) of countries’ efforts. It shows Britain’s energy system has decarbonised at a greater pace than any other nation.
In 2012 Britain was ranked 20
th
, sitting mid-table alongside Italy and Saudi Arabia. But in the four years following, Britain rocketed up to become the seventh least-carbon intense energy system in the world in 2016.
The 47% drop in carbon intensity is the biggest change of any of the countries analysed, and puts Britain just behind Norway and Sweden, which have the resources to support substantial hydropower generation, as well as nuclear-dependent France.
The most any other country moved was eight places – in the opposite direction to Britain. This was the Netherlands where new coal power stations were built at a time when use of coal across England, Scotland and Wales combined reduced by around 80%. The additional coal capacity and power generated from that fuel in the Netherlands led to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions.
A major force in helping drive Britain’s rapid move away from coal is the
Carbon Price Floor
. This currently sits at £18 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emitted, on top of just £5 per tonne in the rest of Europe.

Importing problems?
Imports are making up an increasing amount of the UK’s electricity mix, and in July and August they reached an all-time high of 9%. The majority (60%) of these imports in Q3 2017 came from France, while 30% was from the Netherlands and 10% from Ireland.
However, while importing electricity from overseas has become crucial in helping meeting demand and maintaining a flexible grid, questions remain around the practice’s carbon intensity.
France generates much of its electricity from low-carbon nuclear sources, however, Irish and Dutch exports rely heavily on fossil fuels. As a result, the electricity Britain imported had a 30% higher carbon intensity than that generated domestically – 314 vs 245 g/kWh over the last 12 months.
Over the next five years 7 GW (gigawatts) of new interconnectors are planned for construction (including with France, Norway and Denmark), which could increase electricity imports to provide as much as 10-24% of the country’s electricity. As these continue to play a bigger role in our electricity mix, it is important we ensure it comes from lower-carbon sources where possible and supports the continuing decarbonisation of electricity rather than ‘exporting emissions’.
Read two articles on the topic of interconnectors in Electric Insights:
Importing electricity, exporting emissions?
The future of Britain’s interconnectors
Coal firmly relegated to the bench
The nose-dive of coal generation in Britain since 2012 highlights just how out-of-favour the carbon-intensive fossil fuel has become in the energy system. Now it occupies a role solely as a backup to low-carbon and renewable sources.
Over the summer months coal generation stayed at a historic low of 1.9% of total electricity generation. Between April and August Britain’s 14 GW of installed coal stations only produced 0.6 GW in an average hour. This follows a year of milestones in the decline of coal, most notably in April, when Britain saw its
first day without burning any coal since 1882
.
But this is not to say it has disappeared completely. As temperatures dropped in late summer, coal was called upon to meet sudden demand. On September 19
th
40% of the coal fleet was called upon to produce 5.7 GW on average across that day, showing that even as coal capacity plummets – dropping from 28 GW in 2012 to 14 GW in 2016 – it still plays a necessary role in helping meet peaks in demand.
What’s clear, however, is that this role is only growing smaller and smaller as our power system continues to decarbonise and
flexible energy technologies
replace it.

What is an ‘advantaged’ fuel, and why use them?
10 November 2017
Power generation

Drax Power Station produces 17% of the UK’s renewable electricity, but it has a long history as
a coal-fired generator
. And while today around 70% of Drax’s output is from
renewable biomass
, there are still instances when coal is used – for example, at times of high demand, such as in the
winter months
.
Beyond just meeting demand for power, maintaining some operational coal capacity until it can be replaced with more biomass or
gas
, also allows Drax to offer flexibility and grid stability through ancillary services such as
inertia
,
reactive power
and
frequency management
.
Ensuring these remaining coal units run as efficiently as possible is key to Drax being able to economically provide support services to the grid. And for this, alongside more conventional coals it uses something termed as advantaged fuels.
What are advantaged fuels?
Advantaged fuels are coals outside of Drax’s conventional specification that are slightly more affordable than standard coals. Blending advantaged fuels with standard coal before burning allows generators to remain economical while meeting demand.
At Drax, these include off-specification coal and mine remnants such as pond fines, which are produced from former deep mine sites . These are offered at lower prices than standard fuels because they often have a lower calorific value, meaning they produce less energy when burned, or are difficult to work with and transport.
The benefit, however, is that power stations are able to ramp up generation as well as provide essential system services while remaining economical.
Getting the balance right
Each time an advantaged fuel is used, the right blend must be found depending on how much and what type is being utilised to ensure maximum efficiency and reliability.
This requires coordination across Drax between the fuel procurement team, aiming to source these lower-priced fuels, the materials handling and power generation teams who must quickly understand and resolve any issues surrounding fuel blends and the trading team, responsible for selling into the power market.
The cost savings achieved from using advantaged fuels combined with the highly efficient units Drax Group operates, helps keep costs down and that means lower electricity costs for everyone.
But this doesn’t mean these fuels will be used for the long term. Drax is continuing to decarbonise its power generation business. At Drax Power Station where three of its six power units have been upgraded to low carbon biomass, trials were underway in the spring and summer of 2017 to test a lower cost way of converting one of the three remaining coal units to run on
compressed wood pellets
. The Selby, North Yorkshire site is currently consulting with its local community on
plans to repower one or two coal units
to run on another flexible fuel – natural gas. If constructed, the gas power plant could be joined by a large battery storage facility – one which could provide immediate power and system services to the country’s electricity system while the gas turbines power up in the minutes that follow.
Coal’s days in the UK
are numbered
– and this is
certainly a good thing
– but while it remains a necessary part of meeting winter demand and balancing the system, advantaged fuels will be key to keeping it an affordable one too.

How Drax is boosting jobs and the economy throughout the UK
17 October 2017
Sustainable business

Whether
powering homes
across Britain or helping
stabilise the national grid
, Drax Power Station’s impact to our electricity network is far reaching. But it doesn’t stop at generating and supplying power.
A
new report by Oxford Economics
, commissioned by Drax, has found that in addition to its important role powering Britain, Drax Group also provides an economic boost to areas across the country.
Here are three ways Drax Group contributed to the UK economy in 2016.

£1.67 billion added to UK GDP
Drax Group contributed an estimated £1.67 billion to UK gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016, an increase from
£1.24 billion in 2015
. Of that figure, £301 million was added directly – as a result of the group’s own activities such as the generating and selling of power.
And while this is an impressive 6.1% increase on 2015, the numbers are even more significant when looking at the benefit beyond the group’s core activities.
In 2016, Drax Group’s spending with external suppliers such as rail freight wagon manufacturer
WH Davis
and
IMServ
, which supplies Automated Meter Reading technology to Opus Energy, reached £872 million. A further £36m was spent by these suppliers across their own supply chain to help them provide their services to Drax.
There is an even greater impact when considering how this money filters through employees and suppliers into local retail, leisure and service economies. Something which is especially important when the number of jobs Drax supports is taken into account.
18,500 jobs supported across the country
Drax Group directly employed more than 2,000 people in 2016, but across the country it supports far more – 18,500, a significant increase from the 14,150 of 2015.
These jobs are primarily in high-skilled manufacturing, engineering, construction, IT, professional business services and transport. While 3,650 of these were in Drax Power Station’s native Yorkshire and Humber area, this year saw the group’s overall impact extend much further.

An i
mpact beyond the ‘Northern Powerhouse’
Roughly a quarter (£419 million) of Drax’s total contribution to UK GDP was generated in the
Yorkshire and the Humber
region. When the
North West
and
North East
were included, the company impacted the northern economy to the tune of £577m and supported over 6,000 jobs.
Yorkshire and the Humber was closely followed by the
East of England
, the home of
Haven Power
, which saw the second highest impact – registering more than £200 million contributed in GVA – and
London
and the
East Midlands
.
This is thanks in part to the growing activities of Drax Group companies. Both Haven Power and
Opus Energy
(which became a part of Drax Group in February 2017), are helping the UK move towards a low carbon future by
supplying an increasing amount of British companies with renewable power
. With offices in Ipswich, Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, Haven Power and Opus Energy highlight how Drax Group businesses are direct drivers for local GDP and employment. Opus Energy supported 1,600 jobs and £130 million in GVA in
Wales
,
while Haven Power contributed £232 million to the East of England.
These numbers are noteworthy, but what makes them all the more significant is how this translates into tax revenue. Operations at Drax Group generated an estimated £327 million for the UK’s public purse – equivalent to the salaries of almost 14,000 nurses or 11,900 teachers.
As the group continues to grow –
adding new power generation assets
to the national electricity transmission system and
helping more businesses use renewable power
– Drax can increase its positive impact on the UK’s economy and help to make the country’s low-carbon future a reality more quickly.

How electric vehicles will impact global power demand
1 October 2017
Electrification

The future of cars is electric. Globally, governments are
laying out plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel-powered cars
, while the
falling prices of batteries
will serve to make the vehicles more affordable to consumers and more profitable for manufacturers.
A recent report by Bloomberg increased its earlier 2016 forecast for electric vehicle (EV) adoption. It now estimates that
by 2040, 54% of new car sales and 33% of the global car fleet will be electric
.
This vision of the future points to considerably better air quality in urban and roadside environments across the world. But while EVs emit none of the tailpipe fumes of traditional fossil fuel-powered cars, there is still potential for associated emissions depending on how that electricity is generated.
For example, if the growing demand caused by EVs is met with fossil fuels, then ‘well-to-wheel’ emissions are still in play. However, as electricity grids decarbonise and become smarter and more efficient, EVs will become cleaner. Researchers at Imperial College London have shown that in the UK, year-round average emissions from EVs have
fallen by half in the last four years thanks to cleaner electricity generation
.
What this greater reliance on electricity for transport will certainly do, however, is massively drive up global power demand. Investment will be needed not only in electricity generation but also in smart technology that can allow the charging and, eventually, usage of EVs to be managed efficiently.
The growing demand of EVs
The Bloomberg report states global electricity consumption from EVs is expected to grow from just 6 TWh in 2016 to 1,800 TWh by 2040. While the figure represents a massive increase in the electricity required to power EVs, 1,800 TWh represents just 5% of the projected global power consumption in 2040. By comparison,
the UK as a whole consumed just 304 TWh
of electricity in 2016.
This clearly highlights the widespread need for global investment in electricity generation on the whole, beyond just what will be required to power EVs. However, the unique challenge EVs pose is less how they recharge but
when
they will recharge.
Smoothing spikes
Assuming
supporting infrastructure and technology
progress to enable widespread on-street and home charging, then the demand for electricity to charge EVs will mostly likely come in the evening. This could result in additional pressure being placed on energy generators and national grids due to mass EV charging.
Utilities and regulators will need to implement policies to encourage off-peak charging (for example overnight) and spread out the demand from EVs. One way these spikes will be managed is through ‘time-of-use’ rates to encourage drivers to charge their vehicles at off-peak times to avoid higher electricity bills. However,
technological improvements will also help to manage the demand EVs place on energy systems
.
Tech solutions
Smart charging tech is one of the most important aspects of this in allowing cities, utilities and consumers to automate vehicle charging at times when overall demand is lower. Storage technology will also play a key role in managing increasing demand on both consumer and operator ends.
Adoption of home power storage systems is
expected to grow as fast as solar photovoltaic energy has in recent years
, which will enable consumers with home solar arrays to store energy and charge vehicles at times to avoid peak-hour charges. On the supplier end, advancement in storage technology will allow generators to deliver electricity above their usual capacity and meet spikes in demand.
Autonomous vehicles
While the report suggests autonomous vehicles will not have a significant impact over the next decade, the longer-term influence of self-driving vehicles will have direct consequences on demand.
Autonomous cars will be able to drive in a way that is
significantly more efficient than humans
by driving closer together and interacting with the surrounding city to prevent congestion. With widespread adoption, this greater efficiency would mean cars would use less energy and require less time to recharge.
However, ownership of these types of vehicles will likely be shared, particularity in urban environments, resulting in fewer overall cars on the roads and, ultimately, plateauing or even declining demand from EVs in the 2040s and beyond.
Globally, investment is needed to meet and support the growth of EVs over the next two decades. Governments and businesses must begin to roll out charging infrastructure and clean energy solutions to meet future demand, as well as the
smart city technology
that will enable the mass adoption and eventual automation of EVs.
