inequality in the sector russell hobby ceo of teach first said even before the pandemic hit the poorest pupils were too often left behind their odds of succeeding at school and in the working world

committee about their careers during a qa session engineering student tahmid md said this was a great week and ive learnt a lot from the experience the cv building and interview sessions were especially helpful and i really enjoyed the engineering projects i took part in this years covid lockdown resulted in many students being home schooled for months so the drax virtual work experience

what can be achieved for the environment and the economy when governments businesses and communities work together not developing beccs at drax or more widely across the country will also have

negative emissions in the late 2020s it will cost the uk 45bn more to achieve the fifth carbon budget and require much more challenging action by consumers the fifth carbon budget is a legally binding milestone which caps the amount of greenhouse gases which can be emitted over a fiveyear period  between 2028 and 2032 with the overall aim of reducing the uks emissions to net zero by 2050 not deploying beccs at drax power station would mean the uk could not deliver this important negative emissions technology until at least the 2030s using beccs technology on two of draxs biomass units could capture eight million tonnes of co 2 each year mtpa this means drax could deliver 40 of the climate change committees 2050 net zero beccs power target by 2030 in all modelled scenarios the

august 2021 update following further research from baringa without beccs at drax providing negative emissions in the late 2020s it will cost the uk 13bn more to achieve the fifth carbon budget and

cruachan hydroelectric power station remove fgas switchgear and replace with clean air technology 7 april 2021 press releases siemens has installed four maintenance and fgas free generator circuit breakers at drax groups subterranean pumped hydro storage power station in the scottish highlands siemens has completed a major project with drax group to upgrade the infrastructure in the iconic cruachan pumped hydro storage power station with greener technology replacing equipment that was over 30 years old the project included the uks first installation of four modern siemens generator circuit breakers that do not depend on the sulphur hexafluoride sf6 gas commonly used in switchgear cruachan underground pumped hydro storage plant also known as the hollow mountain supplies up to 440 megawatts of flexible ondemand electricity to the national grid from four reversible turbines and has played a critical role in stabilising the uks electricity system throughout the covid19 pandemic sf6 gas has traditionally been used in circuit breakers due to its good insulation capabilities but is classed as a greenhouse gas siemens innovative nonsf6 generator breakers use vacuum technology instead making them safer and more environmentally friendly there is no risk of gas leakages and no need for costly maintenance carried out by specialist engineers built from materials that are completely recyclable and hermetically sealed the vacuum circuit breakers also have fewer moving parts reducing wear and significantly boosting reliability each vacuum interrupter has a mean time to failure of 77000 years and can run through 10000 operating cycles before a service is required  for cruachan that equates to ten years of maintenancefree operation cruachan power station provides fast reliable power to the national grid as well as the flexibility to absorb excess power  meaning it can start generating or pumping electricity within less than a minute as well as providing system support services to maintain secure supplies of electricity and support more renewables like wind and solar to come onto the grid using a generator circuit breaker simplifies cruachans operational procedures synchronizing the load and avoiding extensive damage inside the transformer with cruachan playing a vital role in supporting the growth of wind power in scotland and enabling further decarbonisation of the grid it is only right that the infrastructure inside the power station is also environmentally friendly explains ian kinnaird draxs head of hydro working closely with siemens we retrofitted a firstofitskind solution that uses innovative vacuum circuit breaker switching instead of sf6 gas not only has this removed any potential environmental impact and health and safety concerns caused by the previous outdated switchgear  the new generator breakers are practically maintenance free reducing costs its a really neat solution ross fraser technical manager power  utilities siemens adds cruachan power station is contracted to provide reliable clean electricity to the grid so it is paramount that the technology installed is dependable safe and sustainable siemens vacuum circuit breakers are built on more than 40 years of engineering experience and have proven their reliability in installations all over the world so we are delighted that drax chose this solution for the uks first implementation inside a hydro power station the project was certainly unique as we were working 1km underground at the heart of ben cruachan mountain but by working very closely with the drax team we achieved a quick turnaround and had the first unit fitted in under 12 months during planned maintenance downtime the generator circuit breakers were installed after being transported through a narrow onekilometre long tunnel that leads deep into ben cruachan mountain the work had to take place over the course of two years during planned maintenance downtime to reduce disruption to this critical national infrastructure notes to editors this press release and press pictures are available at httpsnewssiemenscouk for further information on siemens sf6free switchgear
