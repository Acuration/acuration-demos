to have further clarity from the government about the future for coal and we look forward to working with them and helping to achieve this goal of making the power sector coal free in 2025 as weve said before coal doesnt have a long term role to play in a low carbon future weve already seen a dramatic fall in power generation from coal  an 84 reduction in the last five years and a major shift towards lower carbon technologies at drax were exploring options for repowering our remaining coal units to use sustainable biomass and gas local people to be consulted on plans for gasfired power station 2 january 2018 press releases the proposed open cycle gas turbine ocgt power station would produce up to 299 mw of electricity enough to power the equivalent of about 150000 homes it is intended to be able to be up and running quickly to provide backup power to the national grid during periods of peak demand to support the growing number of renewable and low carbon energy sources as a rapid response and flexible power station it would not be operational all the time  it would be producing power for up to a maximum of 2250 hours in a given year the development will contribute millions of pounds of investment into the local economy create up to 15 full time skilled jobs once operational and up to 150 jobs during the twoyear construction period local people were originally consulted on proposals for the power station in 2014 but the project was put on hold in 2015 due to market uncertainty the project is now under the new ownership of the british energy company drax group plc and is once again being taken forward andy koss drax power ceo said as a result of what was learned during the consultation undertaken in 2014 and other studies we have made a number of changes to the original proposals for example the cable for the electrical connection has been put underground instead of having an overhead line we have selected an access route from the b4489 to the west of the site and reduced the number of stacks from five to one we are looking forward to sharing our latest plans at the public exhibitions next month and hearing what local people think about

christmas day 2017  rounding off a record breaking year for power generation in britain according to analysis of electric insights data by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax 2017 is on course to be the cleanest year for electricity generation carbon emissions from power generation were just 142gkwh on christmas day  more than 10 lower than on december 25 2016  gas generators provided over 30 of the required capacity and coal provided just 14 on christmas day  compared to 179 for gas and 71 for coal in 2016 roasted turkeys were powered by the greenest electricity mix ever in 2017 dr iain staffell of imperial college london said this was achieved in spite of generation from renewables being lower than on christmas day last year mainly due to the continued reduction in coal over this year being swapped for gas power stations the low carbon christmas comes after a whole host of renewables records were broken throughout the year and with much less coal on the system helping to reduce britains carbon emissions by around half of what they were five years ago dr staffell explained the carbon intensity of britains electricity halved between 2012 and 2016 and we think that by new year the 2017 figure will be at least another 10 lower than last years record this means the average british household produced 100 kg less co 2 this year than they did last year without having to lift a finger all the changes are being made behind the scenes electric insights data also shows that january 17 2017 was the dirtiest day of the year with carbon intensity reaching 398g co 2 kwh despite this britains carbon emissions have fallen sharply as renewables records were broken throughout the year dr staffell said several real milestones were reached by renewable electricity throughout 2017  we set a new record in march for renewable generation which was then broken again in june it helped that wind speeds were relatively high during the year so wind farm output was up by around one third compared to last year also electricity demand was a little lower meaning that renewable output formed a bigger part of the mix the records broken throughout the year include february was a record breaking month for biomass with 21gw produced from biomass generation a new record for wind solar hydro and biomass power was made in the first three months of 2017 with 232 of britains power coming from these technologies over the first quarter however this record was then broken again in the next three months with almost a quarter of the uks electricity between april and june being generated sustainably  wind solar hydro and biomass accounted for 249 of the uks energy mix no coal was used in power stations for the first time in more than 130 years on april 22 nd dr iain staffell of imperial college london added this was a huge milestone the first day in which no electricity came from coal since the first steamdriven power station opened in the 1880s on 26 th may a new solar record was made with 31gw of energy produced throughout the day from solar  almost triple the yearly average of 12gw per day dr staffell said a great deal of new solar has been installed on the system which meant that the previous record was smashed june was the cleanest month of the year with 188g per kwh of carbon emitted compared to 339g per kwh in january  the dirtiest month dr staffell said this is due to demand being lower so we could make do with very little coal generation and gas was much lower too 8 th december saw a new record for wind energy with 116gw of electricity from wind power produced over the day dr staffell explained as with solar electricity new capacity made it easy for the previous wind power record to be broken 2017 was also a very windy year compared to 2016 interconnectors also had a recordbreaking year with the link to france reaching new highs for both imports and exports 26 th march saw 1994mw imported into britain from france while conversely 16 th november saw 2020mw exported from britain to france andy koss drax power ceo said britains energy system is rapidly changing as the carbon price floor continues to force coal off the system and gas and renewables play an increasingly important role in helping to reduce carbon emissions  all year round at drax we have upgraded half of the power station to run on flexible reliable sustainable biomass around 70 of the power we produce is now renewable  enough for four million households we are also looking at repowering two of our remaining coal generating units with gas to provide up to 36gw of power and developing up to 200mw of battery storage with the four rapid response gas power stations we are developing which will help to support the system and enable more renewables onto the grid here at drax we are playing an important part in helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future ends media contacts ali lewis
