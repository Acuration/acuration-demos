power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station tag electricity why we need the whole country on the same frequency 23 june 2017 power generation the modern world sits on a volatile fizzing web of electricity in 2015 the uk consumed roughly 303 terawatt hours twh of electricity according to government statistics  thats an awful lot of power humming around and in this country we take it for granted that electricity is controlled this means the power supply coming into your home or place of work is reliable and wont trip your fuse box in short it means your mobile phone will keep on charging and your washing machine will keep on spinning but generating and circulating electricity at safe usable levels is not an easy task one of the most overlooked aspects of doing this is electrical frequency  and how its regulated what is electrical frequency to understand the importance of frequency we need to understand a couple of important things about power generation generators work by converting the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine into electrical energy in a steamdriven generator like those at drax power station  high pressure steam turns a turbine which turns a rotor mounted inside a stator copper wire is wound around the rotor energised with electricity this turns it into an electromagnet with a north and south pole the stator is made up of large heavy duty copper bars which enclose the rotor as the rotor turns its magnetic field passes through the copper bars and induces an electric current which is sent out onto the transmission system as the magnetic field has a north and south pole the copper bars experience a change in direction of the magnetic field each time the rotor turns this makes the electric current change direction twice per revolution and is called an alternating current ac there are in fact three sets of copper bars in the stator producing three electrical outputs or phases termed red yellow and blue electrical frequency is the measure of the rate of that oscillation and is measured in the number of changes per second  also called hertz hz a generator running at 3000 rpm  with two magnetic poles produces electricity at a frequency of 50hz why is this important maintaining a consistent electrical frequency is important because multiple frequencies cannot operate alongside each other without damaging equipment this has serious implications when providing electricity at a national scale the exact figure is less important than the need to keep frequency stable across all connected systems in great britain the grid frequency is 50hz in the us its 60hz in japan the western half of the country runs at 60hz and the eastern half of the country runs at 50hz  a string of power stations across the middle of the country steps up and down the frequency of the electricity as it flows between the two grids sticking to one national frequency is a team effort every generator in england scotland and wales connected to the high voltage transmission system is synchronised to every other generator when the output of any of the three phases  the red yellow or blue  is at a peak the output from all other phases of the same colour on every other generating unit in great britain is also at a peak they are all locked together  synchronised  to form a single homogenous supply which provides stability and guaranteed quality how is frequency managed the problem is frequency can be difficult to control  if the exact amount of electricity being used is not matched by generation it can affect the frequency of the electricity on the grid for example if theres more demand for electricity than there is supply frequency will fall if there is too much supply frequency will rise to make matters more delicate theres a very slim margin of error in great britain anything just 1 above or below the standard 50hz risks damaging equipment and infrastructure  see how far the countrys frequency is currently deviating from 50 hz  managing electrical frequency falls to a countrys high voltage transmission system operator the national grid in the uk the grid can instruct power generators like drax to make their generating units automatically respond to changes in frequency if the frequency rises the turbine reduces its steam flow if it falls it will increase changing the electrical output  a change that needs to happen in seconds in the case of generating units at drax power station the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension which minimises large frequency swings frequency on a fastchanging system not all power generation technologies are suited for providing high quality frequency response roles and as the uk transitions to a lowercarbon economy ancillary services such as stabilisation of frequency are becoming more important neither solar nor wind can be as easily controlled its possible to regulate wind output down or hold back wind turbines to enable upward frequency response when there is sufficient wind similarly solar panels can be switched on and off to simulate frequency response as solar farms are so widely dispersed and tend to be embedded  meaning they operate outside of the national system it is not as easy for national grid to instruct and monitor them both wind and solar have no inertia so the allimportant damping effect is missing too using these intermittent or weatherdependent power generation technologies to help manage frequency can be expensive compared to thermal power stations nor are the current fleet of nuclear reactors flexible  nuclear reactors in great britain were designed to run continuously at high loads known as a baseload power although they cannot deliver frequency response services the countrys nuclear power stations do provide inertia twenty times faster thermal power generation technologies such as renewable biomass or fossil fuels such as coal and gas are ideal for frequency response services at scale because they can be easily dialled up or down as both the fuel supply to their boilers and steam within their turbines can be regulated the 645 mw thermal power units at drax have the capability to respond to the grids needs in as little as half a second or less complete their change in output in under one second and maintain their response for many minutes or even hours before the introduction of high volumes of wind and solar generation almost all generators excluding nuclear running on the system could provide frequency response as these generators are increasingly replaced by intermittent technologies the system operator must look for new services to maintain system stability an example is national grids recent enhanced frequency response tender which asked for a solution that can deliver frequency stabilisation in under a second  20 times faster than the primary response provided by existing thermal power stations drax was the only participating thermal power station however all contracts were all won by battery storage projects frequency future given the decline in fossil fuel generation and uncertainty around our power makeup in future decades national grid is consulting on how best to source services such as frequency response the ideal scenario for national grid is one where services can be increasingly sourced from reliable flexible and affordable forms of low carbon generation or demand response the next generation of nuclear power stations as with some already operating in france can provide frequency response services however the first of the new crop hinkley c is around a decade away from being operational  likewise solar or wind coupled with battery molten salt or flywheel storage will provide an increasing level of flexibility in the decades ahead as storage costs come down thanks to power generation at drax with compressed wood pellets  a form of sustainable biomass britain has already begun moving into an era where lower carbon frequency response can begin to form the foundation of a more reliable and cleaner system this story is part of a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the areas of balancing services system support services and ancillary services read

machine shop 24 april 2017 power generation a klaxon sounds and a crane big enough to lift 160 tonnes moves slowly across the inside of a cavernous warehouse below a team of engineers stand around a turbine spindle the size of a double decker bus but weighing four times as much at 65 tonnes waiting for the cranes descent around them other engineers work on similarsized equipment one uses a wrench the size of an arm another programs a computerised lever to carefully strip millimetres from a piece of steel its just a normal day inside drax power station s machine workshop for the last 15 years this workshop has been refurbishing repairing and manufacturing tools and equipment for use at the power station  a fact that sets drax apart from other stations like it were envied by a few stations because we do most things inhouse says turbine engineer and head of the workshop andrew storr were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people storr set up the workshop in 2001 after being asked to reverse engineer a replacement set of governor relays components that help regulate the flow of steam going into the turbines for one of draxs steam turbines today its a thriving centre of activity filled with heavyduty machinery and ingenious engineers a look inside the workshop when youre manufacturing spares its not a matter of going down to our machine shop and just saying make one of those youve got to have the correct grade of material the correct size the correct certification for the material  you cant just have a scrappy piece of steel that you find its got to have paperwork with it to say its certified up to whatever its supposed to be says storr turbine bearings need to be bored to size using a horizontal borer that very accurately shaves out the lining of the inner bearing getting it right is incredibly important explains storr if its made too large it causes the turbine shaft to vibrate if its made too small the bearing becomes too hot and the white metal will melt and pour out the bearing we need to avoid both of these issues at all cost the inside of the turbine blading needs to have seal strips administered by hand as theyre delicately made to limit any damage to the spinning shaft should they touch each other despite the wealth of equipment at the disposal of the team in the shop success depends on the skill of the engineers using it there are three 160tonne cranes in the turbine hall each installed before the turbines were built this meant the construction companies who erected the turbines could lift all heavy components into place with ease due to their size they move slowly it takes approximately 20 minutes for the largest hook to travel from the ground all the way to the top says storr in mechanical engineering its sometimes necessary to fit one part inside another and once these parts are assembled they must stay locked together and not come apart storr says one way the team does this is by shrinking some components and for this they use liquid nitrogen the team places the component that needs to fit inside another into a bath of liquid nitrogen and shrink it at 190 degrees celsius once shrunk the team assembles the two placing the now smaller component into the larger one eventually the inner part warms up to ambient temperature and grows in size making the fit very tight and preventing them from coming apart explains storr in the past drax would send the work they now do in the machine shop to companies off site and because all other power stations in the area would do the same thing wait times would often be long and the quality of the output could vary when we do it inhouse i can keep my eye on it says storr i can reprioritise things depending on what is going to be needed back on the turbine first  weve got 100 control over it we can make sure everythings hunkydory tags drax power station  electricity  electricity generation  technology your neighbourhood electricity network 31 january 2017 electrification britains electricity network is a lot like its roads for long distance highspeed journeys the road network has motorways  the electricity networks equivalent is the national grid  which transfers power across the country at extremely high voltages between 400000132000 volts and high speeds for shorter journeys at progressively lower speeds the traffic network has a and b roads these are the regional distribution networks these regional distribution networks take power at 132000 volts and transform it down in stages to 230 volts and make the link from the national grid to local distribution systems that deliver electricity to homes and businesses and while these a and b roads of electricity may be one of the most important parts of getting electricity from power station to plug very few people spare them any thought electricity in the north west when the government first privatised the electricity network in 1989  it set up different distribution regions to provide national coverage through a series of similarlysized regions says pete emery senior director of electricity north west  today each part of the uk is served by one of 14 different regional networks and in the north west across the pennines from where drax power station operates in north yorkshire thats the job of electricity north west it was formed in 1995 and today delivers around 23 terawatts of power to 22 million homes and 200000 business every year it does that using a vast network of more than 13000 km of overhead cables 44000 km of underground cables making it the second most underground electricity network in the uk behind london and more than 34000 transformers which work to convert the electricity from transmission voltage to one that can be used in uk homes  the scale of infrastructure needed to create these regional networks mean that each one is a natural monopoly in this case its a monopoly that benefits customers a natural monopoly a natural monopoly is when the cost of duplicating the assets needed to provide the service outweighs the benefits of efficiency that having competition would provide explains emery so it is in the public interest to have only one provider for decades each regional distribution network has operated the same way delivering power consistently to uk homes but as the country moves into the future of cleaner more sustainable energy  these grids are changing rapidly the potential proliferation of battery technologies and the increasing variation of power sources and their demands on the grid mean changes are in store for distributors like electricity north west one such factor already having an effect is embedded generation across the country there are sources of electricity generation that arent connected to regional distribution networks  for example private solar panels on domestic roofs wind turbines on private land or smallscale power stations connected to a single private distribution network and when there is excess electricity generated from these sources it can be sold back to electricity suppliers in the north west this embedded generation is fed back into emerys network in our region alone we have 2200 mw of embedded generation  more than half the capacity of drax power station  which means we already manage and control the power this input brings to the electricity system says emery they are invisible to national grid this is a radical change and its happening now regardless of whats to come whats certain is therell be traffic on the a roads of electricity tags electricity  energy policy  national grid  1 2 3 4 name email comment sign up for
