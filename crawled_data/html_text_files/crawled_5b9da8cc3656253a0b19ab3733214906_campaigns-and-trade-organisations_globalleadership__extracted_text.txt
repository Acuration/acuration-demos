power station to become europes largest decarbonisation project in 2019 drax became the first power generator in the world to capture carbon dioxide co 2  from a 100 biomass feedstock using bioenergy with carbon capture use and storage beccs we want to take this further by becoming carbon negative by 2030 and can support the uk in reaching net zero  the uk continues to be an example to the world on climate action the government has shown global leadership ahead of cop26 in glasgow through its ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and the uks pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 on 1990 levels by the end of this decade we are now ready to use our negative emissions technology so that the uk can reach its climate targets on time we stand ready to invest getting a robust policy framework is critical if we are to capitalise on these cuttingedge green technologies and turn a vision into a reality the positive impacts of these will not be limited to the humber or the north it could kickstart a whole new industry for the uk and abroad enabling us to show the world what can be achieved for communities the environment and the economy when governments businesses and society work together if we are to reach the targets set in paris then the uk must continue to show global leadership at cop26 in glasgow and make this the decade of delivery will gardiner ceo drax group the uk is leading a green revolution to fight climate change the uk can lead the world  being first to deploy negative emissions technologies at scale  making a significant contribution to global efforts to limit climate change  beccs innovation and expertise can be exported gathering international investment and creating opportunities for a global britain to support decarbonisation in industrialised and emerging markets  or the uk risks being left behind as the eu norway canada australia japan china and the us pursue carbon capture technologies and attract global investment in the industries of the future our conversion from coal to biomass was a world first which created a robust and resilient global supply chain for sustainable biomass we can now go further in our decarbonisation and become carbon negative  removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted across our operations now is the time for delivery starting right here in yorkshire the experts agree  to tackle climate change and reach net zero the world needs to remove carbon dioxide thats already in the atmosphere  not just reduce our co 2 emissions today the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in its fifth assessment report into mitigating climate change places a reliance on beccs to help deliver emissions levels required to limit warming to 2 degrees in 101 of 166 scenarios which can deliver this target climate models which had limited or no deployment of beccs in many cases were unable to meet the co 2 concentrations required to limit warming to 2 degrees we cant waste time  now is the moment to act if we want to capture the opportunity lock away carbon emissions forever lead the global fight against climate change and accelerate clean growth and jobs in yorkshire the humber and uk we want to make the uk a global leader in greenhouse gas removal technologies kwasi kwarteng minister of state for business energy and clean growth our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero ccus and beccs present significant export opportunities since the uk has ample storage space for significant levels of co 2 beneath its territorial waters there is also a significant opportunity for the uk to store co 2 for other countries as part of a larger carbon capture use and storage ccus export of technology and expertise the early development of a ccus industry in the uk will allow us to seize this export and storage opportunity early otherwise other countries will take our place the uk has developed a substantial biomass import logistics network and supply chains that can continue to be utilised in the long term deployment of beccs at plants such as drax means that these existing supply chains  where significant investment has already been made  would lower the overall capital costs of developing new infrastructure the economies of scale that large power plants like drax provide mean that this co 2 can be captured more cost effectively than in smaller plants click to viewdownload graphic at drax were investing in our global future carbon removal net zero and climate change carbon removal technologies are a vital part of a solution that also includes decarbonising all sectors of the economy deploying more renewables hydrogen and electric vehicles as well as improving energy efficiency and changing the way we live all are needed to achieve net zero in the uk by 2050 and to help combat the global climate crisis  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the most scalable technology available today to remove carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere through whats known as negative emissions  we are pioneering beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire find
