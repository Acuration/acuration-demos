The jobs needed to build a net zero energy future
11 November 2021
Sustainable business

Many components are needed to tackle climate change and reach environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. One of those components is the right workforce, large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a low-carbon future. In 2020, the renewable energy sector employed
11.5 million people
around the world, but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow.
Last year, a National Grid report found that in the UK alone,
120,000 jobs will need to be filled in the low-carbon energy sector by 2030
, to meet the country’s climate objectives. That figure is expected to rise to 400,000 by 2050.  The UK energy sector as a whole currently supports
738,000 jobs
and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society . Others can be reskilled and retrained, helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition.
At a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from
18 million to 26 million by 2050
. Jobs that will span the full energy spectrum; from researching and advising on low-carbon solutions to installing and implementing them.
Here are some of the roles that will be key to the low-carbon energy transformation:
A wind farm under construction off the English coast
Wind turbine technicians
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), wind power is this year set for a
17% increase in global energy generation
compared to 2020, the biggest increase of any renewable power source. The IEA also forecasts that wind power will need to
grow tenfold by 2050
if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. It’s not surprising, therefore, that wind turbine technicians – the professionals who install, inspect, maintain, and repair wind turbines – are in high demand. In the US, wind turbine technician is the fastest-growing job in the country – with
68% growth projected over the 2020-2030 period
– to give just one example.
In the UK, many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector. Although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available, they are not a prerequisite, and many employers offer apprenticeships and on-the-job training – smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role.
Solar panel installers
Today, solar photovoltaic (solar PV) is the biggest global employer in renewable energy, accounting for
3.8 million jobs
. The IEA also reported a
23% uptick in solar PV installations
around the world in 2020. In the UK, there are currently
13.2 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar power capacity
. Trade association Solar Energy UK predicts this will need to rise to at least
40 GW by 2030
if the UK is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050. The trade association believes this could see the creation of 13,000 new solar energy jobs.
Solar panel installers – who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar PV – are essential to a low-carbon future. Many solar panel installers in the UK come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering. While there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers, they are not a necessity, particularly if you already have on-the-job experience in a relevant sector. This makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering.
Energy consultants
Businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero. Organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources. As professionals who advise companies on this process, renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce. Aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energy-intensive operations. The core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a company’s environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities.
Carbon accountants
A growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. But that’s only possible if you can first determine what your GHG emissions are and where they come from, which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in. Through what is known as physical carbon accounting, companies can assess the emissions their activities generate, and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring. This allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions.
On a wider scale, accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement, as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero.
Battery technology researchers
Energy storage is essential to a low-carbon energy future
.  The ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewables-driven grid.
While many forms of energy storage already exist
, developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area.
Global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage
increased at an annual rate of 14%
–  four times faster than the average for technology – between 2005 and 2018. However, it’s estimated that to meet climate objectives, the world will need nearly 10,000 GW hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040. This is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries.
Farmers and foresters
How we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet. Crops like corn, sugarcane, and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy, and farming by-products such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel.
Techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrient-rich enough to grow food. These techniques include the
use of biochar
, a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen. Research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer. It also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrient-dense.
Forests, meanwhile, provide material for industries like construction, the by-products from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass, primarily in the shape of low-grade wood that would otherwise remain unused. Sustainably managed forests, such as those from which Drax sources its biomass, have two-fold importance. They both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure CO
2
is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle.
Biofuel engineers and scientists
Farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels, but it’s biofuel scientists and engineers who research, develop, and enhance them, opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles, heating, and even jet engines.
According to the IEA, production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6% in 2019. However, the organisation forecasts that production will
need to increase 10% annually until 2030
to be in line with Paris Agreement climate targets.
Scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world, therefore, continues to be vital. As is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel.
The wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial low-carbon roles.
Geologists
The overriding goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to
“well below” 2
and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. This is an objective the IEA has said will be “
virtually impossible” to fulfil
without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. CCS entails capturing CO
2
and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields, coal seams, and saline aquifers.
According to the Global CCS Institute, the world will need a
100-fold increase on the 27 CCS project
currently in operation by 2050. Knowledge and research into rock types, formations, and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe, permanent carbon storage, and sequestration. Skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy.

Employees working at Drax Power Station
Chemists
The role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation. Knowledge and research around CO
2
is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere.
Technologies like CCS,
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECSS
) and
direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS
) are based around such research. Carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents, often based on amines, and GHGs. Understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets.
Chemists’ role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods. From battery technology to reforestation, chemists’ understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change.
Bringing together disciplines
Tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement depends on collaboration between industries, countries, and disciplines. Decarbonisation projects such as the UK’s East Coast Cluster, which encompasses both
Zero Carbon Humber
and Net Zero Teesside, fuse engineering and construction jobs with scientific and academic work.
Zero Carbon Humber, which brings together 12 organisations, including Drax, is expected to create as many as
47,800 jobs in the region by 2027
. Among these are construction sector jobs for welders, pipefitters, machine installers and technicians. In addition, indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains, from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce.
Meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of Zero Carbon Humber, depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future.
Drax’s apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades, and will continue to do so as we build a low-carbon future. Options include
four-year technical apprenticeships
in mechanical, electrical, and control and instrumentation engineering. Getting on-the-job training and practical experience, apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification, such as a BTEC or an NVQ Level 3, at the end of the programme.
Apprentices at Drax Power Station [2021]
The workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one – stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy. It will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field, from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment.
The skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the UK and around the world. Overcoming challenges on the road to net zero requires refocussing these existing talents, skills, and careers towards a new goal.

Landmark moments on the path to a net zero UK
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
10 June 2021
Opinion

In brief
£75m backing for Zero Carbon Humber to develop net zero technologies
Accenture and World Economic Forum report says Humber could decarbonise quicker than any other UK industrial region
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries partners with Drax, supplying its advanced carbon capture technology, making millions of tonnes of negative emissions possible at Drax Power Station this decade
Deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the 2020s will have ‘positive spillover’ for a net zero economy, says Frontier Economics
Delaying BECCS until the 2030s, argues Baringa research, could increase energy system costs by £4.5bn
Planning consent process for BECCS at Drax from 2027 is underway, with public consulted
Drax and Bechtel studying global BECCS deployments
Around the world governments, industries and societies have begun to set themselves targets for reaching net zero but it is at home in the UK where real progress is starting to be made in answering some of the tougher challenges posed by the global environmental crisis.
Eyebrows were raised when the UK set itself one of the most stretching timeframes in which to decarbonise but like many business leaders, I am firmly of the belief that this ambitious target will be the catalyst to deliver the innovative thinking needed to get the planet to where it needs to be.
I was delighted to learn recently that Government has awarded the Zero Carbon Humber partnership
£75 million
in funding to develop world-leading net zero technologies.
MHI BECCS pilot plant within CCUS Incubation Area, Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire
Drax was one of the founder members of the Partnership and its goal is to build the world’s first net zero industrial cluster and decarbonise the North of England. Along with the other members, we worked hard to secure this Government support and it consists of money from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy’s Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge fund, with two thirds coming from private backing. This financing is a vote of confidence from investors and highlights the Government’s commitment to developing the world’s first zero-carbon industrial cluster in the region.
Projects of this scale, backed with meaningful funding, are key to accelerating a range of technologies that will be essential to advancing decarbonisation. These include hydrogen production, carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) and
negative emissions
through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). But more than just having a positive effect on reducing emissions, delivering this in the Humber will also support clean economic growth and future-proof vital industries.

I believe that in a similar way to how renewables have made huge strides in helping decarbonise power, a range of new technologies are now needed to decarbonise industry and industrial regions. Our work as a partnership in the Humber is establishing a landmark project for the UK and the world’s journey to
net zero
and clean growth.
Reaching net zero depends on a diverse range of technologies
There are many factors that will be essential for the
world to reach net zero
, but perhaps none more important than open collaboration and integration. Government, industry and individual businesses will need to work together and share learnings and infrastructure to be able to make true progress. This collaboration will of course take many forms, but one that is crucially important is industrial clusters, such as Zero Carbon Humber and neighbouring Net Zero Teesside.
A recent report by Accenture
highlighted how vital decarbonising industrial regions will be to reaching climate goals. Industrial carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions account for as much as 11 gigatonnes, or 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). However, the report also highlights the opportunities, both environmental and economic, in decarbonising clusters. The market for global industrial efficiency alone is expected to receive investments worth as much as $40bn, while the global hydrogen market was estimated at around $175bn in 2019.
The Humber is the UK’s largest cluster by industrial emissions, emitting 10 million tonnes of CO
2
per year – more than 2% of the UK’s total GHG emissions. Pioneering projects around hydrogen production, CCUS and
negative emissions through BECCS
are all ready to scale in the region, beginning the task of reducing and removing emissions. The potential benefit to the regional economy could also be significant – it’s estimated these technologies could create
48,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs
in the Humber region by 2027. This new £75 million in funding will allow work to gather pace on these transformational projects.
The funding will be used to obtain land rights and begin front-end engineering design (FEED) for the hydrogen facility at H2H Saltend, as well as onshore pipeline infrastructure for CO
2
and hydrogen. It marks the beginning of the vital work of putting transportation systems in place that will take captured CO
2
from Drax Power Station’s BECCS generating units and permanently store it under the southern North Sea’s bed.
Drax’s BECCS power generation is one of Zero Carbon Humber’s anchor projects. Our recently confirmed partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will see its Advanced KM CDR™️ carbon capture technology deployed at Drax Power Station. The negative emissions that this long-term agreement will make possible, will enable the region to reduce its emissions faster than any other UK cluster,
according to Accenture
. Developing negative emissions through BECCS will help us achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030. By that time, Drax Power Station could remove 8 million tonnes of CO
2
from the atmosphere each year, playing a major part in helping the UK meet its climate goals.
From BECCS to a net zero UK
In March 2021, Drax kickstarted the process to gain the necessary planning permissions called a
Development Consent Order (DCO) from the Government
. It’s a crucial administrative step towards delivering a BECCS unit as early as 2027, and a landmark moment in developing negative emissions in the UK.
A
report by Frontier Economics for Drax
highlights BECCS as a necessary step on the UK’s path to decarbonisation. Developing a first-of-a-kind BECCS power plant would also have ‘positive spillover’ effects that can contribute to wider decarbonisation and a net zero economy. These include learnings and efficiencies that come from developing and operating the country’s first BECCS power station, as well as transport and storage infrastructure, which will reduce the cost of subsequent BECCS, negative emissions and other CCS projects.
However, the benefits of acting quickly and pioneering BECCS deployment at scale can only be achieved if policy is put in place to enable the right business models for BECCS and negative emissions. According to the Frontier report, intervention is needed to
instil confidence in investors while also protecting consumer energy prices
from spikes.
Inside MHI pilot carbon capture plant, Drax Power Station
Failure to implement negative emissions through BECCS could also be costly. Time is of the essence for the UK to reach net zero by 2050 and
research by energy consultancy Baringa
, commissioned by Drax, highlights the economic cost of hesitation. Findings showed that delaying BECCS from 2027 to 2030 could increase energy system costs by more than £4.5bn over the coming decade and over £5bn by the time the UK has to reach net zero.
I believe what we are developing at Drax can become a world-leading and exportable solution for large-scale carbon negative power generation. The potential in negative emissions is economic as well as environmental, protecting thousands of jobs in the UK’s carbon-intensive industries, as well as overseas.
BECCS offers great potential for the UK to export skills, knowledge and equipment to an international market. To help establish this market we are
working with engineering and construction project management firm Bechtel
to explore locations globally where there is the opportunity to deploy BECCS, and identify how new-build BECCS plants can be optimised to deliver negative emissions for those regions.
Pictured L-R: Kentaro Hosomi, Chief Regional Officer EMEA, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI); Jenny Blyth, Project Analyst, Drax Group at Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire; Carl Clayton, Head of BECCS, Drax Group;
Multiple government and independent organisations have highlighted how essential negative emissions are to reaching net zero in the UK, as well as global climate goals. The recently formed
Coalition for Negative Emissions
aims to advance this vital industry at a global scale. By uniting a range of negative emissions providers and users from across industries, we can make it a more powerful force for decarbonisation and sustainable growth.
It will still be a long journey towards the UK’s goals, but the Government’s funding for Zero Carbon Humber, the beginning of our BECCS DCO and partnerships with MHI and Bechtel are key steps on the path to reaching net zero by 2050. I, for one, am excited to be on this journey.

The UK is the leader the world needs to tackle climate change
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
11 December 2020
Opinion

December 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. It represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat
climate change
and build a
better future
. However, global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treaty’s target of keeping global warming below 1.5-2 degrees Celsius.
Explore
Carbon Capture by Drax
Countries have set their own
decarbonisation
targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative – as we at Drax
intend to achieve by 2030
. While these leading ambitions are important for the UK and the world to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, real action, polices and investment are needed at scale.
We have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago. We know from the recent 6
th
Carbon Budget that renewable energy, as well as
carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS)
are essential for the UK to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
In that detailed,
1,000-page report
, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) was clear that progress must be made immediately – the country as a whole must be 78% of the way there by 2035. By investing where it’s needed, the UK can lead the world in a whole new industry. One that may come to
define the next century
.
Leading the world in decarbonisation
It was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the UK to launch the Industrial Revolution some 250 years ago. Today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world.
As a country – one that I moved to over 20 years ago now – we have decarbonised
at a greater pace than any other
over the past decade. Investing in renewable generation such as wind, solar and biomass has allowed the UK to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for
net zero emissions
.
To remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future, power grids will require
vastly increased support from energy storage systems
such as pumped hydro – as well as flexible, reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation.
However, the urgency of climate change means the UK must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing
negative emissions technologies
(which remove more carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from the atmosphere than they emit). The CCC, as well as National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios report have emphasised the
necessity of negative emissions for the UK to reach net zero
, by removing CO
2
not just from energy but other industries too.
The UK can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cutting-edge green technology that can take the country to net zero, establishing it as a world leader for others to follow.
Creating an industry, exporting it to the world
When the Paris agreement was signed, I was just joining Drax. I had been impressed by the power station’s
transformation from coal to biomass
– Europe’s largest decarbonisation project – supporting thousands of jobs in the process.
Five years on and I’m excited for the next stage: delivering negative emissions. By
deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
we can permanently remove CO
2
from the atmosphere while producing renewable electricity.
Drax has successfully piloted BECCS and is ready to deploy it at scale as part of our
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and negative emissions
.
I’m confident the partnership with other leading energy, industrial and academic organisations can act as a
revitalising force in a region that has historically been under-invested in
, protect 55,000 jobs and create 50,000 new opportunities.
Developing the supply chain surrounding a world-leading zero-carbon cluster in the Humber could deliver a £3.2 billion economic boost to the wider economy as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
I believe we can establish a new industry to export globally. The Humber’s ports have a long history of trade and we can build on this legacy. The machinery, equipment and services needed to develop BECCS and Zero Carbon Humber will be an essential export as the rest of the world races to decarbonise.

By providing training and partnering with educational institutions we can increase scientific and technical skills. Net zero industrial clusters can enable more in society the opportunity to have rewarding and fulfilling engineering, energy and environmental careers.
This model can reach around the world – positioning people and businesses to help countries to reach the collective goals of Paris Agreements.
The economic benefits for such achievements far outweigh the costs of failing to stem global warming and we are ready to invest in the technologies needed to do so. With robust government policies in place,
a net zero future could cost as little as 1% of GDP over the next 30 years
.
Countering climate change is a once-in-a-lifetime challenge for the world, but also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a sustainable future with sustainable jobs, improved standards of living, health and wellbeing. The UK has a responsibility to use its expertise and resources, setting in place the structures that can allow companies like mine – Drax – to lead the world to reaching the Paris Agreement’s targets and beyond.

Partnering to build a Northern Powerhouse
21 March 2018
Sustainable business

As a company with a strong Yorkshire heritage, we are passionate about supporting the economy of the North of England and promoting the role of the energy sector within it.
That is why we play an active role in the
Northern Powerhouse Programme
and regularly meet with regional bodies such as Transport for the North and Local Enterprise Partnerships.
We are also represented on the board of the
Northern Powerhouse Partnership
, a group of leading northern businesses and civic leaders committed to maximising the economic potential of the North.
As part of our work with the Partnership, the CEO of Drax Power,
Andy Koss
, chaired five workshops focusing on the opportunities and challenges facing the energy sector in the North. Over 100 people attended the workshops in York, Hull, Warrington, Lancaster and Carlisle, which brought together industry experts, local authorities and community groups.
The workshops informed a report published by the Partnership in September 2017,
Powerhouse 2050: Transforming the North
, which recommended several policy interventions to address the North’s productivity gap and create an extra 850,000 jobs by 2050.

How Drax is boosting jobs and the economy throughout the UK
17 October 2017
Sustainable business

Whether
powering homes
across Britain or helping
stabilise the national grid
, Drax Power Station’s impact to our electricity network is far reaching. But it doesn’t stop at generating and supplying power.
A
new report by Oxford Economics
, commissioned by Drax, has found that in addition to its important role powering Britain, Drax Group also provides an economic boost to areas across the country.
Here are three ways Drax Group contributed to the UK economy in 2016.

£1.67 billion added to UK GDP
Drax Group contributed an estimated £1.67 billion to UK gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016, an increase from
£1.24 billion in 2015
. Of that figure, £301 million was added directly – as a result of the group’s own activities such as the generating and selling of power.
And while this is an impressive 6.1% increase on 2015, the numbers are even more significant when looking at the benefit beyond the group’s core activities.
In 2016, Drax Group’s spending with external suppliers such as rail freight wagon manufacturer
WH Davis
and
IMServ
, which supplies Automated Meter Reading technology to Opus Energy, reached £872 million. A further £36m was spent by these suppliers across their own supply chain to help them provide their services to Drax.
There is an even greater impact when considering how this money filters through employees and suppliers into local retail, leisure and service economies. Something which is especially important when the number of jobs Drax supports is taken into account.
18,500 jobs supported across the country
Drax Group directly employed more than 2,000 people in 2016, but across the country it supports far more – 18,500, a significant increase from the 14,150 of 2015.
These jobs are primarily in high-skilled manufacturing, engineering, construction, IT, professional business services and transport. While 3,650 of these were in Drax Power Station’s native Yorkshire and Humber area, this year saw the group’s overall impact extend much further.

An i
mpact beyond the ‘Northern Powerhouse’
Roughly a quarter (£419 million) of Drax’s total contribution to UK GDP was generated in the
Yorkshire and the Humber
region. When the
North West
and
North East
were included, the company impacted the northern economy to the tune of £577m and supported over 6,000 jobs.
Yorkshire and the Humber was closely followed by the
East of England
, the home of
Haven Power
, which saw the second highest impact – registering more than £200 million contributed in GVA – and
London
and the
East Midlands
.
This is thanks in part to the growing activities of Drax Group companies. Both Haven Power and
Opus Energy
(which became a part of Drax Group in February 2017), are helping the UK move towards a low carbon future by
supplying an increasing amount of British companies with renewable power
. With offices in Ipswich, Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, Haven Power and Opus Energy highlight how Drax Group businesses are direct drivers for local GDP and employment. Opus Energy supported 1,600 jobs and £130 million in GVA in
Wales
,
while Haven Power contributed £232 million to the East of England.
These numbers are noteworthy, but what makes them all the more significant is how this translates into tax revenue. Operations at Drax Group generated an estimated £327 million for the UK’s public purse – equivalent to the salaries of almost 14,000 nurses or 11,900 teachers.
As the group continues to grow –
adding new power generation assets
to the national electricity transmission system and
helping more businesses use renewable power
– Drax can increase its positive impact on the UK’s economy and help to make the country’s low-carbon future a reality more quickly.

How a new industrial revolution in green energy is transforming the North once again
6 October 2016
Sustainable business

The North of England has long been a proving ground for the kind of engineering innovations that have transformed the world. The heartland of the First Industrial Revolution, it is now at the centre of a new revolution focused on clean energy production and sustainable power, led by organisations like Drax.
Europe’s largest decarbonisation project
Over the last decade, Drax has been carrying out a major high-tech engineering and infrastructure project to upgrade half its generating units to use sustainable biomass in place of coal.
These converted units now produce enough electricity to power Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle – all using compressed wood pellets, cutting carbon emissions by more than 80%.
But more than just having environmental benefits, it’s provided a huge boost to the economy.
Boosting the UK economy
In 2015, Drax contributed
more than £1 billion to the UK’s GDP

and supported some 14,000 jobs across the country.
“The economic benefit has reached all parts of the country,”
says CEO Dorothy Thompson
. “We’ve been the catalyst for rejuvenation and growth across the Northern Powerhouse, with port expansion on the coasts of East Yorkshire, the North West and North East.”
This boost was particularly significant in the North, where Drax generated over £620 million for the local economy.
Innovation driving a better future for Britain
It’s these kinds of innovative upgrades that are helping to tackle the urgent environmental challenges that our society faces as we make the transition to lower carbon and renewable power, and changing the way we think about producing energy in the UK.
Having nurtured the Industrial Revolution, today the North of England is again the focus of a major paradigm shift. Where once coal fields and smoke stacks dominated the local landscape, now Drax’s giant biomass storage domes speak of a new future for the region, for the UK, and for renewable energy production as a whole.
