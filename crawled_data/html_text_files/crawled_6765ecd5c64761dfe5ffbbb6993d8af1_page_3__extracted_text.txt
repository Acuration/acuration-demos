archives press release drax given green light for new 500 million underground pumped storage hydro plant 25 july 2023 press releases scotlands first minister humza yousaf called on the uk government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for projects such as cruachans expansion while on a tour of the facility today tuesday the scottish government has formally approved plans to expand the iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station through building a new underground plant at the site the new plant would strengthen uk energy security with flexible generation while enabling more wind power to come online with the right support from the uk government the new plant could be operational as soon as 2030 with almost 1000 jobs created and supported during development renewable energy leader drax group has secured development consent from the scottish government for its groundbreaking plans to build a new c500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at its existing cruachan facility in argyll the decision made through the section 36 process is a significant moment in scotlands journey to net zero with new longduration storage plants critical to enabling more wind and solar power to come online in the next decade scotlands first minister humza yousaf visited draxs iconic power station on the shores of loch awe today tuesday where he underlined his call for the uk government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for hydro power and other long duration energy storage technologies mr yousaf recently wrote to the prime minister urging him to take action so developers can have the certainty required to build a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants the new 600 mw plant at cruachan is part of a wider 7 billion strategic investment plan by drax in clean energy technologies between 2024 and 2030 such as long duration storage and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which tackle climate change and enhance national energy security constructed adjacent to the existing underground facility the plant would effectively more than double the sites total generation capacity to over 1 gw growing the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid enhancing the nations energy security while tackling climate change pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it will gardiner drax group ceo said this is a major milestone in draxs plans to build britains first new pumped storage hydro plant in a generation these plants play a critical role in stabilising the electricity system helping to balance supply and demand through storing excess power from the national grid when scotlands wind turbines are generating more power than we need cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesnt go to waste with the right support from the uk government drax will invest c500m to more than double cruachans generating capacity and support almost 1000 jobs across the supply chain during construction the expansion of cruachan requires an updated financial stabilisation mechanism from the uk government the current absence of a framework for largescale longduration storage technologies has resulted in no new plants being constructed in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in the decarbonisation process first minister of scotland humza yousaf said im delighted to visit cruachan today to hear more about the plans to grow scotlands pumped storage hydro capacity through the expansion of the existing facility in argyll hydro power has real potential to play a greater role in our transition to net zero and to help ensure a resilient and secure electricity supply across the uk the expansion of cruachan will help to strengthen our energy security by providing much needed resilience in the system supporting hundreds of jobs and providing a real boost to the scottish economy however we know that there remain a number of challenges in developing new hydro power projects in scotland the scottish government will continue to urge the uk government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for hydro power and other long duration energy storage technologies to ensure that the potential for hydro power is fully realised drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes drax applied for development consent from the scottish government under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 in may 2022 the uk government has pledged to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in largescale longduration storage projects by 2024 a report by kpmg for drax found that a cap  floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently no investment decision has yet been taken by drax and

this announcement positions the uk as the potential home of one of the largest compliance markets for carbon removals in the world and we are delighted that the government intends to include engineered greenhouse gas removals ggrs in the uk ets the development of such a market is an important step towards deploying largescale carbon removal technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs these technologies are essential in the fight against climate change as they permanently remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit with the right support from the uk government drax plans to invest billions into delivering beccs at our power station in north yorkshire this would enable the plant to simultaneously remove millions of tonnes of carbon

for climate nature and people drax group chief sustainability officer alan knight said if the world is to meet the global climate challenge carbon removal technologies like beccs need to be up and running at scale as quickly as possible however what is arguably more important than the quantity of beccs required is the quality of the beccs delivered to realise the transformational benefits beccs could bring we need to ensure it is implemented well  adhering to strict criteria and carefully monitored in our response to the beccs done well report we have addressed the criteria presented by jonathon porritt and the highlevel panel on how to implement beccs in a way that delivers positive outcomes for climate nature and people the beccs done well report was prepared at the request of drax group ceo will gardiner who invited jonathon porritt environmental campaigner to convene a highlevel panel to conduct an independent inquiry into beccs the panel chaired by jonathon porritt convened brad gentry of the yale school of environment stuart haszeldine of the university of edinburgh and clare oneill acting as an independent consultant with forum for the future serving as secretariat jonathon porritt cofounder of forum for the future said as members of the highlevel panel were impressed at the level of detail in the responses from drax to the 30 conditions we put forward in our report in november last year and were pleased that the vast majority of these responses are positive as is now beginning to be recognised the whole area of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is becoming more and more material in the debate about carbon dioxide removals and negative emissions technologies we believe drax has positioned itself in the vanguard of this debate ensuring both policymakers and potential competitors understand fully what done well really means beccs exists in a complex ecosystem of land use biodiversity social factors economics carbon reduction and now carbon removal each of these factors must be considered and tradeoffs carefully managed if beccs is to play a meaningful role in achieving our climate change targets drax aims to become a leader in global beccs with the aim of removing 14 million tonnes of co2 a year by 2030 the technology has a critical role to play in helping nations reach their decarbonisation goals while also supplying jobs and boosting economies  but this potential is not yet being met drax group ceo will gardiner said this work by jonathon porritt and an independent panel of experts shows that beccs can be done well
