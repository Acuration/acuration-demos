riverpowered hydro schemes work managing hydropower in tune with the environment 21 february 2020 power generation hydro power is one of the most widespread sources of electricity generation in the world  it is also one of the biggest nine of the worlds ten largest power stations are hydro powered  facilities such as the three gorges dam on chinas yangtze river and the itaipu dam pictured below on the brazilparaguay border are capable of generating massive amounts of electricity  itaipu dam hydroelectric power station on the brazilparaguay border but hydropower can also be very effective at a smaller more local level using relatively small rivers these smaller hydro facilities can bring renewable electricity to remote areas and serve local needs all they need is an abundance of flowing water to spin their turbines in scotland two schemes are making use of the countrys plentiful water sources to help the local community the economy and the surrounding environment turning river waterflow into power the lanark and galloway hydropower schemes are both located in rural scotland and have been generating power for nearly a century despite being more than 95 kilometres apart they operate in very similar ways lanark which includes two power stations  bonnington with a capacity of 11 mw and stonebyres with a capacity of 6 mw sits on the river clyde and began generating power in 1926 making it one of the oldest hydroelectric plants in great britain galloway soon followed coming online in the mid1930s it includes a total of six power stations  glenlee tongland kendoon drumjohn earlstoun and carsfad  eight dams and a network of tunnels and pipelines giving it a capacity of 109 mw kendoon power station turbine hall there was always potential for hydro in the galloway hills but there wasnt demand for 100 mw of power explains stuart ferns operations and maintenance manager on the lanark and galloway hydro schemes however when the national grid was established in the 1920s it enabled surplus power to be transmitted beyond the local area to glasgow and further afield unlike lanark which is situated about halfway down the river clyde the galloway scheme spans the entirety of its river system from loch doon in the north to tongland in the south both however cover a similarly sized catchment area of roughly 1000 square kilometres where they do differ is in the type of hydropower they generate and the needs they serve for their regions and the wider electricity grid tongland dam lanarks power stations generate electricity through whats called runoftheriver hydropower which describes a scheme where there is no dam to stop and store water along the river instead water from a flowing river is diverted into a power station situated alongside the river here the water is used to spin a turbine connected to a generator before being returned back to the river lanarks two power stations are both positioned alongside naturally occurring waterfalls which allow them to take advantage of the natural gravitational pressure the lanark stations run constantly says om manager stuart ferns they will run as long as there is water in the river and generally there is always some water available the galloway system is different it only generates power when there are peaks in electricity demand to do this it operates a conventional storage hydro scheme where dams situated along the river are used to create small reservoirs when demand for electricity peaks  typically between 5pm and 7pm  water is released from these reservoirs and used to spin turbines and generate electricity during the day both schemes are monitored and controlled from glenlee power station halfway down the galloway route as night falls responsibility instead falls to the control room at cruachan power station  more than 200 kilometres away aroundtheclock monitoring in this way is important as the uncertainty of scotlands weather can have effects on the schemes and on their surrounding environment penstocks leading to glenlee power station working with the landscape dumfries  galloway and lanarkshire are regions defined and dominated by their river systems as such extreme weather can lead to occasional natural flooding the lanark and galloway schemes not only have to be diligent in working with extreme weather but they can actually play a role in monitoring and managing it the galloway reservoirs help to alleviate flooding because they can store water and help to alleviate flooding downstream says ferns staff at the scheme work closely with local authorities landowners and the scottish environment protection agency sepa sharing their weather forecasting and reservoir level data to help them predict which areas will be affected and when roads might need to be closed or even villages evacuated the team takes a similar approach to monitoring and protecting the local wildlife fish such as north atlantic salmon and trout migrate upstream from the ocean through the galloway rivers using manmade fish passes also known as fish ladders which allow fish to bypass dams along the scheme waterfalls on the clyde at lanark lanarks natural waterfalls mean it is not a route taken by migratory fish however ensuring there is always enough water in the rivers to protect fish and plant life factors into how both schemes operate with the landscape working with the wildlife weather and surrounding environment of the two rivers have always been a part of running the lanark and galloway schemes their continued role in the regions electricity system highlights
