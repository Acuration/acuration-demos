“We also made good progress delivering our strategy, which is clear and unchanged. We are increasing biomass self-supply, developing projects to diversify our generation mix and growing our B2B energy supply business.
“The UK is undergoing an energy revolution, starting with a significant reduction in carbon emissions, and to support that we are helping to change the way energy is generated, supplied and used.”
Notes for analysts and editors
2017 Group Financial Review
Underlying earnings per share decreased to 0.7 pence
Accelerated depreciation of coal-specific assets, amortisation of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Opus Energy and an increase in net finance charges.
Reported basic earnings per share – a loss of 37 pence, which includes unrealised losses on derivative contracts of £156 million (principally related to the foreign currency hedging programme) in addition to one-off items – transaction costs relating to the acquisition of Opus Energy (£8 million) and refinancing (£24 million)
Tax – one-off non-cash charge of £16 million – a reduction in US federal tax rates from 35% to 21% resulting in a revaluation of deferred tax balances, offset by £13 million cash tax credit from UK Patent Box tax regime, which rewards Drax patented innovation in biomass generation
Investment in line with guidance
Acquisition of Opus Energy (£367 million)
Acquisition and commissioning of LaSalle Bioenergy (£48 million)
Maintenance and improvement (£133 million) including pellet plant optimisation, strategic spares, Haven Power information systems, research and innovation and Opus Energy office consolidation
Continue to expect ongoing maintenance capital investment of £50-60 million per year
Net debt of £367 million (31 Dec 2016: £93 million), including cash on hand of £222 million
