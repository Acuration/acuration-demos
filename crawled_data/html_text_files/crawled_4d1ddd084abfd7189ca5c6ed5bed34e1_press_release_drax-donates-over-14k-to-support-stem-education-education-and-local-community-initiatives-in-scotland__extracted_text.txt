local community initiatives in scotland renewable energy company drax has donated over 14000 from its community fund to 11 local groups and causes in the areas where it operates across scotland including cruachan power station in argyllshire 6 june 2023 shona king drax group head of community said drax has a long tradition of giving back to the communities we operate in and this year we have stepped up our community funding to allow us to support even more good causes and ensure our business has a positive impact on people nature and the climate we are pleased to announce that in the first round of community funding this year we will be awarding close to 60000 of grants to 40 different organisations in the uk which support stem education and skills or work to improve the local community of the total 14350 has been awarded to 11 different communityled projects local to draxs operations in scotland this includes embers aquatics who run water safety workshops for primary schools in the cruachan area oban junior community football club to help them purchase sports equipment and run a training camp trip wildcat explorer scouts argyll to purchase climbing equipment and rockfield primary school to develop an outdoor area for children with complex needs anna roscoe founding director of embers aquatics said swimming is a lifesaving skill as well as a great form of exercise yet the number of children unable to swim in the uk is rising at a drastic rate this is particularly worrying as we have seen a number of tragic incidents in scottish waters in recent years last summer we ran vital water safety workshops for local children in schools across lochaber and now with the help of this funding we plan to expand the workshops to more rural areas across scotland including the three primary schools close to cruachan ensuring that as many children as possible benefit from water safety education draxs community fund donations are awarded once a quarter to local projects in the regions where drax operates which fit into the following categories stem education skills development and employability improving green spaces in local communities improving our communities kevin roy from the oban junior community football club said our football club is an inclusive group which gives children of all backgrounds the opportunity to socialise meet new people and have fun all whilst promoting mental and physical health and wellbeing securing additional funding helps massively with alleviating some of the financial burden imposed on parents especially families who are struggling due to the financial challenges that we are facing at present this donation from drax will help to cover a whole host of costs from equipment and pitch fees to transport and the annual football trip which is so beneficial for our young people draxs community fund provides donations of 5002000 for communityled projects in addition the drax foundation was launched in march this year to award larger grants of up to 50000 for established nonprofit organizations organisations and initiatives that meet draxs funding and selection criteria are encouraged to visit
