transport contact us tag supply chain drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies 21 march 2018 sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags decarbonisation  investors  supply chain  sustainability  united states  wood pellets how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power on our shores tags investors  railways and trains  supply chain  sustainability building a 21st century port 16 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy in its long history the port of liverpool has dealt with a number of industries its a port characterised by its ability to adapt to the needs of the time in 1715 it emerged as one of the worlds first ever wet docks in the 18 th century it was used as a hub for the slave trade when slavery was abolished in the early 19th century liverpool switched to bringing in the goods of the thriving empire such as cotton when goods like cotton dried up it switched to the fuel of the industrial revolution coal now as the world and the uk government moves away from fuels like coal and towards lowercarbon and renewable resources the port of liverpool needed to adapt once again gary hodgson chief operating officer at peel ports  explains about three years ago everyone was asking what happens after coal what happens after coal peel ports is one of the biggest operators of liverpools shipping infrastructure including liverpool port seeing that the future of coal was finite it recognised there was a need for a port that could bring in alternative renewable fuels at the same time drax was looking for a logistics partner to facilitate the importing of compressed wood pellets since 2009 drax power station had begun a process of upgrading its coalfired boilers to run on sustainable biomass sourced from huge wellestablished working forests  more than this it had plans to set up its own pellet manufacturing plants in the us south and needed to import large quantities of wood pellets the relationship with peel ports and liverpool was obvious this began a 100 million investment that helped transform the regions portstation transport infrastructure its about working in partnerships with companies says hodgson working this way helps develop solutions that really work the central element of the partnership between drax and peel ports was a radical redesigning of the technical infrastructure not only do compressed wood pellets have fundamentally different physical properties to other fuels like coal they are more combustible and need to be handled safely for the threemilliontonnecapacity facility that peel ports and drax wanted to build innovative supply chain solutions had to be developed shifting biomass in bulk the first challenge was getting the highdensity pellets off giant ships for this peel and drax designed a solution that uses an archimedean screw  a long tube with a spiral winding up the inside that allows liquids or materials that can behave like a liquid like wood pellets to defy gravity and travel upwards at the top of the screw the pellets are emptied onto a conveyor belt and carried to one of three purposebuilt silos tailored to safely storing thousands of tonnes of biomass  here the pellets wait until another conveyor belt deposits them onto speciallydesign biomass trains where they are transported across the peaks of the pennines to drax power station near selby in north yorkshire each step at the port is automated designed with supreme efficiency in mind by a team of drax and peel port engineers endtoend port to power station the whole process can take as little as 12 hours a new chapter for the north in the varied history of the port of liverpool the new facility is another chapter one that is helping transform the logistics infrastructure and the economic growth of the north west now open and operational the facility directly employs 50 people  around 500 additional contractors have worked on the project during its construction and development more than that its an investment in the countrys energy future it secures a fourth port for drax  three others are on the east coast  helping with security of supply we made this investment because we recognised this as the future of the energy mix of the country hodgson explain we cant just rely on one form of power  there has to be an energy mix and we see biomass as a key part of that tags biomass energy  ships and shipping  supply chain  sustainability how one company helped transform the biomass business 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy if asked to picture canada its beautiful forests often spring to mind in fact 38 of the country is covered by them little wonder that canada has one of the worlds biggest lumber industries but all that lumber milling means a lot of sawdust it was in this sawdust and the other waste products the milling process creates that one fledgling canadian company spotted an opportunity making the most of waste started by two brothers in the 1980s pinnacle originally made animal feed for farmers  compressed pellets of grass and grain then in the late eighties after hearing about wood pellet production in scandinavia and taking a look at all the sawmilling residues being burned up around them they had an idea for a new direction at the time the canadian government was looking to make the sawmilling industry a lot cleaner and more sustainable there was a lot of fibre around that needed to find a home explains vaughan bassett a senior executive with the company canada needed a way to put to good use materials that were previously just thrown away or even burnt out in the open releasing greenhouse gas emissions and wood pellets seemed like a natural fit even better because there was so much waste fibre around at the time pinnacle was able to get its raw material for free and help to avoid the unnecessary emissions all it had to do was pick it up and take it away finding a new business model making the transition from feed pellets to wood pellets involved a lot of trial and error there was a lot of entrepreneurial spirit that went into this thing says bassett it was untried untested unknown and there was no real market it was just a couple of entrepreneurs trying stuff out initially pinnacle produced its wood pellets for local domestic markets  people looking to heat their homes local businesses and schools that used wood burners this is a particularly convenient and efficient form of fuel for communities in offthegrid remote areas of canada but pinnacle was keen to grow and make an even greater impact rising demand for sustainability by the early 2000s some in the power generation industry were starting to rethink their longterm futures looking to shift from fossil fuels like coal to cleaner alternatives in order to meet the challenges of sustainable energy production central to pinnacles business is a commitment to sustainability  something being based in canada where forest management is particularly advanced makes possible being owned by the crown there are very tight controls over how canadian forests are run  and how the trees are used weve probably got the most sustainable wood fibre in the world the numbers are just mad something like 95 of all the forests in canada are forest management certified which is unbelievable look at the next best country and its probably nearer 30 says bassett its left us with an incredible asset that keeps growing every year the industry never takes more wood than what grows indeed carefully managed forestry is key to environmental sustainability fullygrown older trees dont absorb as much co 2  so replacing them with younger growing trees that do can benefit the environment meanwhile the waste product of sawmilling is converted into biomass which produces further benefits by reducing reliance on fossil fuels pinnacle and drax a sustainable partnership pinnacle first started supplying drax with compressed wood pellets in 2009 marking a turningpoint for the company since 2011 our production has doubled says bassett pinnacle now contracts a fleet of ships and has its own dedicated port facility each vessel can transport 60000 tonnes given that drax uses around 16000 tonnes a day with two of its three biomass units at full capacity one shipment keeps a third of the huge power station in north yorkshire going for nearly four days pinnacle now produces in the region of 15m tonnes of pellets a year about half of which goes to drax so theyre a very important part of what we do says bassett read the burns lake and houston pellet plant catchment area analysis here  part of a series
