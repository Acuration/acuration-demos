Embedded Mitigation
8.7.1
This section sets out the measures which have been assumed to be
included as integral parts of the implementation of the Project, i.e. The
Project could not be delivered without them.
8.7.2
The assessment of impacts on ecological receptors assumes that these
measures will be implemented, with the initial significance of impacts
assessed on the basis that these embedded measures are effective.
Where embedded mitigation measures are considered relevant to a
VER they are referred to in that section of the impact assessment.
8.7.3
Where the embedded mitigation measures do not fully avoid or mitigate
impacts upon VERs, additional targeted mitigation measures are
recommended.
Mitigation Included in Design
8.7.4
The design of the final Project layout has been an iterative process
(refer to Section 5).
8.7.5
The Gas Connection route was decided following a feasibility study
taking into consideration various limitations (refer to Section 5).  The
chosen Gas Connection route avoids several ponds which have been
assessed as having ecological value.
8.7.6
The Electrical Connection route was decided following a feasibility
study (refer to Section 5) with ecology as one of the considerations.
The final route was selected partly as this would avoid any significant
impacts to Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC.
8.7.7
The layout of the PGP has also been modified through the design
process to avoid any land-take within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate
SINC.
Description of ‘Designed In’ Measures / Mitigation and Monitoring
Measures
8.7.8
There are a range of environmental mitigation and monitoring
measures included within the proposed design and development to
ensure adverse impacts upon the environment are avoided (in the first
instance) or minimised.
8.7.9
Mitigation and monitoring measures which impact on the scope of
effects described in subsequent sections include:

· 
The design has been significantly altered during the detailed design
process, to avoid direct effects on wetland habitats within Hirwaun
Industrial Estate SINC.
· 
Implementation of a Construction Environmental Management Plan
(CEMP);
· 
Adherence to all relevant, Best Practice Guidance / Regulations,
British Standards, and monitoring in respect of air quality, noise
and vibration, and water resources;
· 
Implementation of industry standard methods and procedures to
ensure air quality impacts are minimised throughout all phases of
the project;
· 
The 1.7 ha of the Hirwaun Common SINC affected by the Gas
Connection will be reinstated following installation of the pipeline.
Mitigation Applied During Works Planning/Construction
8.7.10
Construction impacts are assessed with consideration given to the
implementation of a Construction Environmental Management Plan
(CEMP), which it is envisaged would be secured by a DCO condition.
During the detailed planning of construction works, efforts will also be
made to minimise the footprint of all construction activities to less than
the worst case scenario assessed within this ES.
8.7.11
The draft CEMP, identifies the construction site management which will
be implemented to avoid/minimise generation of excessive litter, dust
noise and vibration.  Monitoring will ensure the measures are effective.
8.7.12
The CEMP identifies measures that will be implemented to
avoid/minimise potential for fuel and chemical spills and spill kits will be
ready to hand in the unlikely event of a fluid spill.  There will be no
storage of potentially contaminating materials in areas of ecological /
hydrological sensitivity.  A Pollution Incident Response Plan is included
as part of the CEMP to ensure that impacts from any potential
accidental spills can be reduced to a minimum.
Air Quality Risk/ ‘Designed In’ Measures
8.7.13
The air quality assessment has identified the construction-phase dust
effects impacts on ecological receptors are no more than minor with
appropriate dust mitigation measures (see Section 6).  These minor
effects apply only to the SINC sites within 100 m of the Project.
8.7.14
No other designated sites are likely to be subject to detrimental effects
as a result of dust deposition.  This is because all other designated
Hirwaun Power Project Environmental

sites are in excess of 250 m from the Project, well beyond the range at
which perceptible dust deposition will occur.
8.7.15
A site specific dust management plan (DMP) will be developed as part
of the CEMP for the site, in consultation with the local authority and
relevant regulatory bodies.  It is envisaged that the CEMP (and hence
DMP) will be secured by a requirement attached to the DCO for the
Project.  This will ensure dust-related effects on the Hirwaun Common
and Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC are suitably mitigated.
8.7.16
Appropriate dust mitigation measures for the Project will include:
Site Management
· 
Records of dust and air quality complaints to be kept, including
likely causes and mitigation measures to reduce impacts if
appropriate;
· 
Daily on-site and off-site visual inspections to be undertaken and
recorded;
· 
Inspections should be increased in frequency during periods of high
activity or prolonged dry, windy weather; and
· 
Keep site perimeter, fences etc clean.
Site Planning
· 
Consideration of weather conditions, dust generating potential of
material to be excavated prior to commencement of works;
· 
Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles etc to
sensitive receptors; and
· 
Dusty materials to be removed from site as soon as possible or
stored in excess of 50 m from the boundary of the designated sites.
Construction Traffic
· 
Loads entering and leaving the site with dust generating potential
should be covered and wheel washing facilities made available;
· 
No idling of vehicles;
· 
Vehicles to comply with site speed limits (15mph on hard surfaces,
10mph on unconsolidated surfaces);
· 
Install hard surfacing as soon as practicable on site and ensure it is
maintained in good condition.

Site Activities
· 
Exposed soils should be re-vegetated as soon as practicable.  Near
residential 
properties 
or 
sensitive 
ecosystems 
(<50m),
hessian/mulches shall be used where it is not possible to re-
vegetate or cover with topsoil;
· 
Minimise dust generating activities, particularly near residential
receptors/sensitive ecosystems during prolonged dry, dusty
weather unless damping / other suppressants are used;
· 
Ensure an adequate water supply to site and use water as dust
suppressant where applicable;
· 
Ensure any site machinery is well maintained and in full working
order;
· 
Ensure equipment available for cleaning spills etc available at all
times; and
· 
Sand and aggregates should be stored away from sensitive
receptors and screened/shielded.  Similarly concrete batching
should take place away from receptors.
8.7.17
The list of standard mitigation measures ensures daily visual
inspections of dust emissions and quantification are made.  However,
in addition, the IAQM guidance on monitoring air quality at construction
sites (IAQM, 2012) recommends that ambient air monitoring be
undertaken in the vicinity of high risk sites.  This data is required for two
reasons: the first relates to ensuring that mitigation measures are
appropriate and being applied rigorously; the second is to provide on
early warning of increased dust emissions which allows for the
cessation or modification of activities prior to impacts occurring.
Hydrological Risk/’Designed In’ Measures
8.7.18
The hydrological assessment (see Section 9 for full details) has
identified that significant hydrological effects upon either Hirwaun
Industrial Estate SINC are not predicted.  This is largely as a result of
the planned re-use of the existing foundations at the Power Generation
Plant site, and the narrow footprint of the Gas Connection corridor
combined 
with 
sensitive 
reinstatement 
of 
habitats 
following
construction.
8.7.19
Other embedded mitigation measures will include industry standard
methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction /
demolition, operation and decommissioning are minimised. These
include:

· 
Any surface water with the potential to be contaminated by
hydrocarbons to be passed through oil/grit interceptors prior to
discharge to sewer;
· 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any surface
water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be allowed to
enter directly or indirectly any water course, underground strata or
adjoining land;
· 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the
contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made aware
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the
likelihood of accidental impacts;
· 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted
to a designated area with appropriately designed fuel tanks and
bunds and suitable operating procedures.
· 
Siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to avoid
pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working guidelines to
avoid spillages near watercourses; and
· 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are
stored will be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single tanks
will be within bunds sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity and
multiple tanks or drums will be within bunds sized to contain the
greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the largest tank or
25 per cent of the total tanks contents, in accordance with EA PPG
2.
8.7.20
In terms of interruptions to lateral drainage / surface water drainage
from construction of the Gas Connection, the following mitigation
measures will also be included in the CEMP:
· 
Access roads / haul routes will be constructed to effectively
manage drainage;
· 
Soil bunds will be placed strategically so that drainage catchments
are not diverted or altered;
· 
Temporary wheel washing facility will be installed to prevent
transfer of soil onto nearby public roads if necessary;
· 
If deemed necessary, temporary drainage routes / silt fences will be
constructed (of geo-textile);
· 
Care will be taken during construction to ensure that silt laden
water does not enter watercourses.  This will be achieved by

plugging existing drains, intercepting surface water above the
working width and where appropriate by leaving filter strips of
unstripped topsoil along main watercourses / ditches.  Topsoil will
be replaced over post-construction drains as soon as possible to
prevent site water from getting into drains;
· 
Any de-watering pumping will be undertaken using an appropriately
sized pump at such a rate to avoid disturbance or erosion of stream
banks;
· 
De-watering pipes will be carefully positioned; and
· 
All pumps, pipes and connections used during construction will be
regularly inspected.

Assessment of Impacts
Predicted Changes to the Baseline
8.8.1
Significant changes in the baseline conditions between the present time
and the proposed commencement of construction are considered
unlikely although it should be noted that the agricultural activities
undertaken in the Gas Connection area of the scheme could influence
the ecological diversity of that part of the site based on the regimes
being implemented, should management of the site change.
8.8.2
Given construction is predicted to commence within five years of
production of this ES (in 2019) it is considered that the key components
that have a fundamental bearing on ecological diversity are likely to
remain broadly similar.
8.8.3
Consideration has been given to where conditions for some receptors
could improve and change their status within this time period, in order
to ensure an accurate assessment of the potential future baseline is
included.  This is in line with IEEM guidance for assessment of
ecological impacts55.
Predicted Impacts and Effects of Project Activities to Ecological
Receptors
8.8.4
The construction impacts have potential varying ZoI which are
considered in detail below in order to allow an effective assessment of
potential construction phase impacts on VER’s:
