INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 
MPL is promoting an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) gas fired power 
station at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at Rookery 
South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire. 
1.2 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP) by virtue of section 14(1)(a) and section 15 of the Planning Act 
2008 (PA 2008) which includes within the definition of an NSIP any 
onshore generating station in England or Wales of 50 MWe capacity or 
more. Under section 31 PA 2008 a Development Consent Order (DCO) 
is required to develop an NSIP. Under section 37 PA 2008 this can only 
be granted if an application is made for it to the Secretary of State 
(SoS) (the DCO Application).  
1.3 
The Project would comprise:  
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas 
Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural 
gas and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with 
an exhaust gas flue stack and balance of plant, which are located 
within the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating 
Equipment"); 
 A new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment 
Site (the "Access Road" or the “Short Access Road”);  
 A temporary construction compound required during construction 
only (the "Laydown Area"); 
 
A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to 
the Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System  
(the "Gas Connection"); and 
 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) (the "Electrical Connection").  
1.4 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are 
together known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within 
the Power Generation Plant Site. 
1.5 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection, together with all access requirements, are referred to as 
the "Project".  The land upon which the Project would be developed, or 
which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the 
Project, is referred to as the "Project Site".

1.6 
Section 37 of the PA 2008 governs the content of an application for a 
DCO, including the requirements for the necessary accompanying 
documents specified in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed 
Forms 
and 
Procedure) 
Regulations 
2009 
("APFP 
Regulations").  
1.7 
Regulations 5 and 6 of the APFP Regulations provide the statutory 
requirements for what must accompany a development consent 
application. Guidance issued by the Department for Communities and 
Local Government1, requires that: 
'Where the proposed development will also require 
other consents, licences, permits, etc, to enable it to be 
constructed and / or operational, and for which the 
[SoS] is not the authorising body, then the applicant 
must list and briefly describe these in … the 
application. Reference should be given to any that 
have already been applied for, and a copy enclosed of 
any that the applicant may already be in the 
possession of.' 
1.8 
This document comprises part of the application documents and 
provides details of consents required in addition to those being 
requested as part of the DCO.
