Drax Group plc ESG Data Supplement 2022
Relating to the Drax Group Plc Environmental 
and Social Governance data for the period  
January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Drax Corporate Ltd 
(hereafter referred to as ‘Drax’ in accordance with our contract
Terms of Engagement
LRQA was commissioned by Drax to provide independent 
assurance on selected Environmental and Social Governance data 
(hereafter referred to as ‘Selected Information’), for the period 
January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, against the assurance 
criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at a materiality 
of the professional judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s 
verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is based 
on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000 
and ISAE 3410.
Our assurance engagement with Drax covered 
the following requirements:
• Verifying conformance with:
 
–  Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Databook. 
Drax Group Procedure.
 
– World Resources Institute / World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
A corporate accounting and reporting standard, revised 
edition (otherwise referred to as the WRI/WBCSD Protocol) 
for the GHG data1.
• Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information 
for only the selected indicators listed below:
 
– Group Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and 2);
 
– Group GHG emissions (Scope 3);
 
– Water abstraction and discharge;
 
– Total Recordable Injury Rate;
 
– Employment data on headcount;
 
– Group energy consumption;
 
– Percentage of emissions in the UK;
 
– Group generation emissions intensity; and
 
– Group emissions intensity.
Our assurance engagement excluded the following data 
and information:
 
– data of Drax’s suppliers, contractors and any third-parties 
mentioned in the report;
 
– category 13 downstream assets 
LRQA’s responsibility is only to Drax. LRQA disclaims any liability 
or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. 
Drax’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing 
and presenting all the data and information within the report 
and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems 
from which the report is derived. Ultimately, the report has 
been approved by, and remains the responsibility of Drax.
LRQA Independent Assurance Statements
1 
 http://www.ghgprotocol.org/
2 
 The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less 
than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements 
focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. 
Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained 
had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach, nothing has come to our 
attention that would cause us to believe that Drax has not, 
in all material respects:
• Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and
• Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data 
and information in the Selected Information.
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level 
of assurance2 and at the materiality of the professional 
judgement of the verifier.
LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance 
with our verification procedure and with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, 
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance reports 
dated on or after December 15, 2015), issued by the International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (December 2013).
The following tasks were undertaken as part of the evidence 
gathering process for this assurance engagement:
• Review of the evidence pack;
• Conducted virtual interviews with relevant personnel of Drax;
• Review of the data collection and consolidation processes 
used to compile the Selected Information, including assessing 
assumptions made, the data scope and reporting boundaries;
• Reviewed a sample of the Selected Information against the 
corresponding source documentation provided by Drax; and
• Performed a selection of aggregation calculations of the 
Selected Information.
Observations
Further observations and findings, made during the assurance 
engagement, are: 
• The company should continue to make every effort 
to improve the accuracy of submitted data to the workbook. 
Assumptions have been made appropriately but actual 
data would be an improvement.
• The company should continue to develop the calculations 
in a way that allows factors and conversions to be applied 
in a clear and transparent manner.
• It would be beneficial to complete periodic reviews 
of the ESG reporting process, to consider its effectiveness 
and where opportunities for improvement could be.
• It would be beneficial to develop sense checks where appropriate, 
to monitor data trends and to highlight any initial data errors 
such as those arising from changes in reporting units.
• Drax must obtain and retain evidence to demonstrate the 
reliability of the Scope 3 quantification modelling.
