beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc (“Drax”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), are not warranted or guaranteed. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the

competitive pressures in the industry; future investment and support for the Group’s objectives; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting

Financial Summary
Strong financial and operational performance
Adjusted 
EBITDA(1)
£225m
(H1-21: £186m(2))
1)
Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (revaluation of deferred tax 
balances reflecting future increases in UK CT rates, acquisition costs, gain on sale of CCGT generation assets (2021), restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges and 
impairments), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
2)
Includes continuing and discontinued operations (H1 2021: £21m of discontinued operation – CCGT generation assets).
3)
Cash and short-term investments of £288m less borrowings of £1,388m.

Further savings in H1 offset by targeted inflationary increases and commissioning costs
(1) Free On Board – cost of raw fibre, processing into a wood pellet, delivery to Drax port facilities in US and Canada, loading to vessel for shipment and overheads.
2% increase in H1-22
-
Increase in utility costs (> 20% increase)
-
Fuel surcharges on barge and rail transport to port (> 10% increase)
-
Commissioning costs at Demopolis & Leola – 80% of full volume

-
“Other” represents a net reduction across all other costs:
-
Other savings more than offset costs incurred optimising the supply 
chain to support reprofiling of  Generation
-
No material change in raw fibre costs
Areas of focus for savings
-
Increased use of lower cost residuals and a wider range of sustainable 
biomass materials
-
Continued optimisation across fibre, transportation and production
-
Incremental throughput at existing sites and addition of new capacity
-
Development and introduction of new technologies and innovation

“Biomass utilization strategies paired with 
sequestration, like bioenergy with carbon capture and 
storage (BECCS). The Proposed Scenario estimates that 
5–10 MTCO2e may be available from recoverable
