API2/4/6
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on 
board (“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered 
FOB to Newcastle, Australia.
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges).
BM
BALANCING MECHANISM
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the 
system minute by minute.
CESP
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME
CESP has been created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It requires gas 
and electricity suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic 
consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 
2009. The CESP obligation period ran from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012. 
DECC
DEPARTMENT FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
DIRECT INJECTION
A process whereby biomass is fed directly (i.e. avoiding the pulverising mills) to the burners situated in 
the boiler walls.
EBITDA
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative 
contracts.
ELV
EMISSION LIMIT VALUES
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD. This sets annual limits on the emissions of 
NOX, SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the forthcoming PPC permit.
EUA
EU ALLOWANCE
European Union Allowances, the tradable unit under the EU ETS. Equals 1 tonne of CO2.
EU ETS
EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME
Trading Scheme within the European Union. The first compliance phase ran from 2005-07, the second 
compliance phase continued from 2008-12 and the third phase is proposed to run from 2013-2020.
IUK
INTERCONNECTOR UK
Sub sea gas pipeline and terminal facilities providing a bi-directional link between the UK and continental 
European energy markets. 
LCPD
LARGE COMBUSTION PLANT DIRECTIVE
European Union Large Combustion Plant Directive sets emission standards for NOX, SO2 and particulate 
from all Large Combustion Plant (>50MW).

LTIR
LOST TIME INJURY RATE
The frequency rate calculated on the following basis (number of accidents/hours worked * 100,000). 
Accidents are defined as occurrences where the injured party is absent from work for more than 24 
hours.
NERP
NATIONAL EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLAN
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD and the one selected by Drax. This sets 
annual limits on the emissions of NOX, SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the 
forthcoming PPC permit.
NOx
Nitrogen oxides, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD.
OFGEM
OFFICE FOR GAS AND ELECTRICITY MARKETS
OPTED-IN / OPTED-OUT
An opted-in plant is a power station that has elected to comply with the LCPD emissions standards. 
Opted-out plant has not elected to comply and is therefore only permitted to run for 20,000 hours and 
must in any event close by the end of 2015.
POND FINES
Coal dust and waste coal from the cleaning and screening process which can be used for coal-fired 
power generation.
RO
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity 
from eligible renewable sources. 
ROC
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of 
the electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable 
energy sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation 
dependant on date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.

SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION
Converting nitrogen oxides with the aid of a catalyst into diatomic nitrogen and water. A gaseous 
reductant, typically anhydrous ammonia, is added to a stream of flue gas and absorbed onto a catalyst.
SO2
Sulphur dioxide, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD. 
TRIR
TOTAL RECORDABLE  INJURY RATE
TRIR is calculated on the following basis (lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries)/
hours worked * 100,000.
UKCS
UK CONTINENTAL SHELF
Gas reserves found off shore in UK waters.
UK NAP
UK NATIONAL ALLOCATION PLAN
Allocation of UK emissions allowances at the national level to individual sites under EU ETS.

Fukushima impact on global 
LNG market continues
•
Japanese nuclear constrained
- 2 of 54 reactors in operation
•
Increased Asian LNG prices 
limits UK spot market attractiveness 
- LNG import uncertainty
Extended winter across Europe –
gas storage heavily depleted
•
Rough storage (UK) record low in April
- Expect high summer demand to 
replenish storage reserves
- Rough injecting at record highs
UK gas prices remain strong
•
Prices pulled towards oil indexed 
European prices to attract imports
•
Prices remain at a premium
to US prices
Increased UK import dependency
•
Continued decline of UKCS

Appendix 14: ROC Banding Conclusions 
Renewables Obligation (RO) –
suppliers must source increasing 
volume of renewable power
Obligation can be met in two ways:
•
Surrender ROCs or pay a buy-out
All buy-out funds recycled to suppliers 
that surrender ROCs
•
Buy-out is mandated price with RPI
indexation; currently c. £41/MWh
Mechanism in place to ensure:
•
Obligation increases annually; and
•
Obligation > expected ROC production
Cash flows
•
Obligation is annual (April – March)
•
ROCs surrendered or buy-out paid by 
1 September following March year end
•
Recycled funds paid out in October
•

pressures in the industry; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting the relevant industry, both domestically and
internationally, being less favourable than expected. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these projections or other forward-looking
