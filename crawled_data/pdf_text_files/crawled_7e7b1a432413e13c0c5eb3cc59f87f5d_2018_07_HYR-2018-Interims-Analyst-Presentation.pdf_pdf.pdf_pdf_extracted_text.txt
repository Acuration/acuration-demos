BALANCING MECHANISM
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation / consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the system 
minute by minute.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and material one-off items that do not reflect the 
underlying trading performance of the business.
EBIT
Earnings before interest and tax.
EPS
Earnings Per Share.

EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME
Trading Scheme within the European Union. The first compliance phase ran from 2005-07, the second 
compliance phase continued from 2008-12 and the third phase is proposed to run from 2013-2020.
OCGT
Open Cycle Gas Turbine.
Patent Box
The Patent Box enables companies to apply a lower rate of Corporation Tax of 10% to profits earned from 
the deployment of patented technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating 
electricity from biomass.
RO
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity from 
eligible renewable sources. 
ROC
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of the 
electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable energy 
sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation dependant on 
date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.
TRIR
TOTAL RECORDABLE  INJURY RATE
TRIR is calculated on the following basis (lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries) /
hours worked * 100,000.

Underlying rate excludes after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative and material one-off items
Full year effective tax rate expected to be lower than UK tax rate of 19% principally driven by estimated Patent Box 
Claims for 2018, where profits associated with biomass patented technology are now subject to tax at 10%
Combined with a prior year credit in respect of the FY 2017 Patent Box Claim, where the methodology to derive the 
patent box income has now been agreed with HMRC, the total underlying tax credit for the period is £5m
