The biogenic carbon emissions resulting from generation 
are counted as zero in official reporting to both UK 
authorities and under the UK Emissions Trading 
Scheme (UK ETS) as the use of sustainable biomass is 
considered to be CO2 neutral at the point of combustion. 
This methodology originates from the United Nations

Assurance statement
Relating to the Drax Group Plc Environmental and 
Social Governance data for the period January 1, 2021 
to December 31, 2021.
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Drax Corporate 
Ltd (hereafter referred to as ‘Drax’ in accordance with our 
contract.
Terms of Engagement
LRQA was commissioned by Drax to provide independent 
assurance on selected Environmental and Social Governance 
data (hereafter referred to as ‘Selected Information’), for the 
period January 1 2021 to December 31 2021, against the 
assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at  
a materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using 
LRQA’s verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is 
based on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000 
and ISAE 3410.
Our assurance engagement with Drax covered the following 
requirements:
• Verifying conformance with:
 
– Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Databook.  
Drax Group Procedure.
 
– World Resources Institute / World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A 
corporate accounting and reporting standard, revised 
edition (otherwise referred to as the WRI/WBCSD Protocol) 
for the GHG data1
• Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information 
for only the selected indicators listed below:
 
– Group Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and 2);
 
– Group GHG emissions (Scope 3);
 
– Water abstraction and discharge;
 
– Employment data on headcount;
 
– Group energy consumption;
 
– Percentage of emissions in the UK;
 
– Group generation emissions intensity; and
 
– Group emissions intensity.
Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information 
of Drax’s suppliers, contractors and any third- parties mentioned 
in the report.
LRQA’s responsibility is only to Drax. LRQA disclaims any liability 
or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. 
Drax’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and 
presenting all the data and information within the report and for 
maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from 
which the report is derived. Ultimately, the report has been 
approved by, and remains the responsibility of Drax.
LRQA Independent Assurance Statement

2  The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement  
is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance 
engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking  
source data at sites. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been 
obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.  
LRQA’s Opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach, except for the effect of the matters 
described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion, nothing has come  
to our attention that would cause us to believe that Drax has 
not, in all material respects:
• Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and
• Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and 
information in the Selected Information.
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of 
assurance2 and at the materiality of the professional judgement 
of the verifier.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
• LRQA did not verify any graphical representation of the 
selected data.
• The Scope 3 GHG emissions exclude Category 13 Downstream 
leased assets.
• The Scope 3 GHG emissions have been quantified using 
software models. These have not been verified by LRQA.  
In addition, no evidence was presented to otherwise verify 
their reliability.
• The Basis of Reporting (Appendix 1 of the Environmental and 
Social Governance (ESG) Databook (Drax Group Procedure)  
is available on the webpage: www.drax.com/sustainability.
• Drax Group Plc utilise a rolling base year for the GHG emissions 
inventory, as described in the Basis of Reporting.
• The GHG emissions have been calculated using, where 
practicable, the Global Warming Potential factors from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth 
Assessment Report.
• The Drax Biomass Calculator V2.0 that is used to calculate the 
GHG intensity of wood pellets has been verified to reasonable 
assurance during a separate assurance engagement. This was 
not undertaken by LRQA.
• Drax Power Station has been verified to limited assurance as 
follows. This was not undertaken by LRQA. The scope of the 
verification engagement covered sustainability data reported 
in Section 5 (Part A – Monthly Biomass Usage Statement)  
and Section 6 (Annual Biomass Statement for the Facility for 
the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021) of the ‘Drax Power 
Station 3rd Conversion Unit (Unit #1), SC Annual Compliance 
Report and SC Audit Report, 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021’, 
Prepared for: Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited, Date: 
14 June 2021.
• Drax Power Station has been verified to limited assurance as 
follows. This was not undertaken by LRQA. The scope of the 
verification engagement covered sustainability data reported 
in Sections 4 (Part A – Monthly Biomass Usage Statement) 
and Section 5 (Annual Biomass Statement for the Facility for 
the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021) of the ‘Drax Power 
Station (RB) – A,C,E Sustainability Audit Report, 1 April 2020  
to 31 March 2021, Prepared for: Ofgem, Date: 14 June 2021.

LRQA’s Approach
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance 
with our verification procedure and with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, 
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance reports 
dated on or after December 15, 2015), issued by the International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (December 2013).
The following tasks were undertaken as part of the evidence 
gathering process for this assurance engagement:
• Reviewed the evidence pack;
• Conducted virtual interviews with relevant personnel of Drax;
• Reviewed the data collection and consolidation processes 
used to compile the Selected Information, including assessing 
assumptions made, the data scope and reporting boundaries;
• Reviewed a sample of the Selected Information against the 
corresponding source documentation provided by Drax; and
• Performed a selection of aggregation calculations of the 
Selected Information.
Observations
Further observations and findings, made during the assurance 
engagement, are:
• The company should continue to make every effort to improve 
the accuracy of submitted data to the workbook. Assumptions 
have been made appropriately but actual data would be an 
improvement.
• The company should continue to develop the calculations  
in a way that allows factors and conversions to be applied  
in a clear and transparent manner.
• The company has implemented a system to indicate 
confidence levels with data (a RAG indicator). This will help  
to demonstrate improved confidence with the more detailed 
datasets. It would be beneficial to complete periodic reviews 
of the ESG reporting process, to consider its effectiveness and 
where opportunities for improvement could be.
