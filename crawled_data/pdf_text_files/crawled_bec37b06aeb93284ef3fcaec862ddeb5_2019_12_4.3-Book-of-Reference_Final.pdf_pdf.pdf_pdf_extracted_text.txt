Introduction 
 
1. This document is the "book of reference" accompanying Millbrook Power Limited's (MPL’s) application for a 
development consent order (Document Reference 3.1 and referred to in this book of reference as the "Order") 
authorising the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299MW gas fired peaking power 
generation plant. 
 
2. This book of reference is required by regulation 5(2)(d) of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (the "Regulations") and describes the land to be affected 
by the Order and details of its ownership.  
 
3. This book of reference describes the land parcels which the Order grants powers of compulsory acquisition 
or temporary possession over and which are shown on the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5) which 
accompany the application.  This land is defined as the "Order land" in the Order.   The descriptions of the 
parcels include their approximate areas in square metres. 
 
4. The purpose of the book of reference is to list: 
 
a. the plots of land over which powers of temporary possession or compulsory purchase are sought 
in the development consent order (including the creation and acquisition of new rights and 
imposition of restrictive covenants); 
 
b. any owners of land outside the boundaries of the proposed development who might have a 
statutory claim for compensation as a result of the construction and/or use of the proposed 
development; 
 
c. any easements, servitudes or other rights (including restrictive covenants) over land which may 
be interfered with, suspended or extinguished as a result of the proposed development;  
 
d. any of the land required for the project which is owned, or potentially owned, by the Crown; and 
 
e. any land required for the project which falls into a 'special category'.  
 
5. The book of reference must be in five parts. 
 
 
Part 1 – Names and addresses for service for each person within Categories 1 and 2 in respect 
of any land which it is proposed shall be subject to (i) powers of compulsory acquisition; (ii) 
rights to use land, including the right to attach brackets or other equipment to buildings; or (iii) 
rights to carry out protective works to buildings. 
 
 
Part 2 – Names and addresses for service for each person within Category 3. 
 
 
Part 3 – Names of those persons entitled to enjoy easements or other private rights over land 
which it is proposed shall be interfered with, suspended or extinguished. 
 
 
Part 4 – Names and addresses for service for each Crown interest in land which is proposed to 
be used for the purposes of the Order for which this application is being made. 
 
 
Part 5 – Names and addresses for service for each person and description of land subject to 
special parliamentary procedure, special category land or replacement land. 
 
6. A person is within Category 1 if the applicant, after making diligent inquiry knows that the person is an owner, 
lessee, tenant (whatever the tenancy period) or occupier of the land (s.57(1)). 
 
7. A person is within Category 2 if the applicant, after making diligent inquiry knows that the person, is: (a) 
interested in the land; (b) has the power to: (i) to sell or convey the land; or (ii) to release the land s.57(2)). 
 
8. A person is within Category 3 if the applicant thinks (after making diligent inquiry) that, if the order sought by 
the application were to be made and fully implemented, the person would or might be entitled: (a) as a result 
of the implementing of the order; (b) as a result of the order having been implemented; or (c) as a result of 
use of the land once the order has been implemented; to make a relevant claim (s.57(4)). 
 
 
9. Part 2 has been split to accommodate those persons who, if the Order were to be made or fully implemented, 
would or might be entitled to make a claim pursuant to Section 10 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 or 
s152(3) of the Planning Act 2008 (Part 2a), and those persons who would or might be entitled to make a 
claim pursuant to Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (Part 2b). 
 
10. Plots ending in _PGP can be found on the plan titled “Power Generation Plant Land Plan (Sheet 1 of 3)”, 
Document Reference 2.5. 
 
11. Plots ending in _EC can be found on the plans titled “Electrical Connection Land Plan (Sheet 2 of 3)”, 
Document Reference 2.5. 
 
12. Plots ending in _GC can be found on the plan titled “Gas Connection Land Plan (Sheet 3 of 3)”, Document 
Reference 2.5. 
 
13. The “low level restoration scheme secondary access track” means an access track into Rookery South Pit 
from Station Lane which is to be constructed in accordance with the permitted Low Level Restoration Scheme 
of Rookery South Pit (reference number BC/CM/2000/8). 
 
14. The book of reference should be read in conjunction with the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5).
