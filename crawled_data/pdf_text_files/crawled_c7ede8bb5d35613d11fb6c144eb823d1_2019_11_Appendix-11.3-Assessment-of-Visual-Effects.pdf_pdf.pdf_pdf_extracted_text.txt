Appendix 11.3: Assessment of Visual Effects
This Appendix should be read in conjunction with Figure 11.7 - 11.8 and Appendix 11.4. Note: All landscape and visual mitigation is embedded and described in Chapter 3: Project Site and Description.
All effects identified in the table below are residual. The cumulative assessment has been undertaken for the project as a whole and not for each individual element.

Viewpoint 1
North side of J64 of M4, on B4489
Description of View:
This view is representative of road
users travelling north along the
B4489. Wide, panoramic views are
experienced 
across 
the
rural
wooded landscape extending to
the rising upland which defines the
skyline
to 
the 
north. 
Road
infrastructure 
including 
lighting
columns 
and 
signage 
are
prominent in the foreground view
along with the extensive network
of pylons and overhead lines
which extend into and across the
mid-ground 
of 
the 
view,
punctuating 
the 
skyline. 
The
Felindre Gas Compressor Station
and 
Substation are
prominent
features within the centre of the
view, all set within the extensive
wooded landscape.
Receptor Group:
Road Users
Value:
This is an ordinary view
with many
detracting elements. Value is considered to
be Low.
Susceptibility:
This viewpoint is representative of road
users where the view is incidental to the
receptor’s 
reason 
for 
being 
there.
Susceptibility is Low.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall visual
sensitivity of views experienced by road
users along the B4489 is considered to be
Low.
Construction/decommissioning Phase:
For a temporary period of time and of short duration,
some construction plant and activities would be visible
in the mid-ground of the view. This is likely to be limited
to tall plant such as cranes which would be visible in
conjunction with the existing pylons which break the
skyline as well as possible stockpiles of soil associated
with the construction of the Gas Connection. The
majority of the construction plant and activity would be
screened by intervening vegetation.
Magnitude of
effect is considered to be Low.
Taking into account the Low sensitivity and Low
magnitude resulting effects would be Minor Adverse.
Minor Adverse
Not significant
Not 
considered 
in 
cumulative
assessment as residual Project effects
are not significant.
Operational:
The Power Generation Plant would be viewed against
a backdrop of higher ground noticeable within small
portion of the periphery of the view and seen in the
context of the existing
Substation,
Felindre
Gas
Compressor Station, and network of pylons. The stack
would be visible against the skyline, although the
skyline is regularly disrupted by existing pylons which
create prominent vertical elements common in the
view. Magnitude of effect is considered to be Low.
Taking into account the Low sensitivity and Low
magnitude resulting effects would be Minor Adverse.

Construction/decommissioning Phase:
Temporary construction activity and taller plant such as
cranes associated with the construction of the stack
and upper parts of the Project Site would be visible
against the skyline. Intervening trees and woodland
would limit the extent of construction activity visible in
the view although, the degree of screening provided by

Viewpoint 1
North side of J64 of M4, on
B4489
Description of View:
This view is representative of
road users travelling north along
the B4489. Wide, panoramic
views are experienced across
the rural wooded landscape
extending to the rising upland
which defines the skyline to the
north. 
Road 
infrastructure
including lighting columns and
signage are prominent in the
foreground view along with the
extensive network of pylons and
overhead lines which extend
into and across the mid-ground
of the view, punctuating the
skyline. 
The 
Felindre 
Gas
Compressor 
Station 
and
Substation 
are 
prominent
features within the centre of the
view, all set within the extensive
wooded landscape.
Receptor Group:
Road Users
Value:
This is an ordinary view with many
detracting elements. Value is considered to
be Low.
Susceptibility:
This viewpoint is representative of road
users where the view is incidental to the
receptor’s 
reason 
for 
being 
there.
Susceptibility is Low.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall visual
sensitivity of views experienced by road
users along the B4489 is considered to be
Low.
Construction/decommissioning Phase:
For a temporary period of time and of short duration,
some construction plant and activities
including
temporary stockpiles of soil associated with the
construction of the Gas Connection pipeline route
would be visible in the mid-ground to distance in the
periphery of the view. The majority of the construction
plant and activity would be screened by intervening
vegetation. Magnitude of effect is considered to be
Low.
Taking into account the Low sensitivity and Low
magnitude resulting effects would be Minor Adverse.
Minor Adverse

Project as a whole and not individual

Operational:
The AGI would not be visible and the Gas Connection
pipeline

would 
be 
fully

once
operational.
Whilst the boundary hedgerow and tree
planting would not be fully established at year of

with no discernible change to the view. Magnitude of

Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity is

Operational:
Once operational the Gas Connection route would be
fully reinstated, although at year of opening the grazing
land and reinstated field boundaries would not have
established and so a corridor cutting across the
landscape would remain visible until the mitigation
planting and seeding establishes. Similarly the screen
planting around the AGI would take time to establish
and whilst it would not be visible from this particular
point on the PRoW it would be a noticeable feature in
views as walkers travel north until the screen planting
becomes mature.
Whilst the reinstatement planting establishes the
magnitude of change would be Low which when
combined with a Medium sensitivity would result in a
Minor Adverse effect at year of opening. Once the
reinstatement planting associated
with the Gas
Connection route becomes fully established (year 15)
there would be no discernible change in the view
resulting in a Negligible magnitude and Negligible

pastoral field defined by post
and wire fence and hedgerow
planting. Solar panels, part of
the 
larger 
solar 
farm 
are
prominent in the view with some
mature specimen trees partially
screening views towards them.
Within the mid ground of the
view 
extensive 
woodland
planting screens the majority of
views of the valley beyond.
Where views extend to the
valley beyond, grazed fields and
further planting are apparent
along with structures associated
with 
the 
Felindre 
Gas
Compressor Station. Pylons and
transmission lines are prominent
in the view and seen against the
skyline. The northern suburbs of
Swansea are visible in the
distance.
Susceptibility:
This viewpoint is representative of views
from residential properties where the views
will be experienced daily and are an
important 
part 
of 
the 
experience.
Susceptibility is High.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity is
considered to be High.
Viewpoint 18
Footpath on the north side of the
A48 Clasemont Road
Description of View:
This view is representative of
views 
from 
the 
residential
properties which line the south
side of Clasemont Road. There
are very few publicly accessible
views due to the roadside
hedgerow and tree planting
which line the north side of the
road and provide an effective
screen even in the winter.
Foreground views extend across
grazing land with pockets of
marshy vegetation. Extensive
tree and woodland cover with
hedgerows 
defining 
field
boundaries extends across the
mid ground of the view. Pylons
and 
transmission 
lines 
are
prominent features in the view
Receptor Group:
Residential
Value:
This is a view containing relatively common
but attractive elements of the landscape
along with some detracting features and is
valued locally.  Value is considered to be
Medium.
Susceptibility:
This viewpoint is representative of views
from residential properties where the views
will be experienced daily and are an
important part of the experience.  However,
extensive roadside planting screens the
majority of the views north and as such
susceptibility is considered to be Medium.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements and
susceptibility to change, overall sensitivity is
considered to be Medium.
Construction/decommissioning Phase:
Construction of the Electrical Connection would not be
visible from this location.
