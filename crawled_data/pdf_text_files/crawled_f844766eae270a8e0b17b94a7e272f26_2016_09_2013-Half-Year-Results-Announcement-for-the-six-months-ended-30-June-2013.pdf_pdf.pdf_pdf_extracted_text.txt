Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive of Drax, said:  
“In the first half of 2013 we have delivered good operating performance across the business during a 
period of extensive activity at the Drax site.  
 
“The first converted unit was commissioned at the beginning of April, generating electricity from 
sustainable biomass in place of coal. The unit, which is the largest converted unit in the world, has 
been operating safely and delivered expected performance, using the interim storage and delivery 
systems in place. We will start commissioning the new bespoke systems later this year.  
 
“We are investing significant capital this year and next to transform our business, with earnings during 
this period impacted by the increasing costs of carbon. However, as we move beyond this investment 
phase and replace substantial quantities of coal with sustainable biomass, we are confident that we 
will deliver attractive returns for our shareholders.  
 
“We welcome the Government’s recent announcements and consultation on the Feed-in Tariff with 
Contracts for Difference (“CFD”) mechanism, which potentially provides additional options to support 
future unit conversions. We are participating in the consultation process and will assess whether these 
options are attractive to Drax.”

Chairman’s introduction 
 
The Group performed well in the first half of the year. We have delivered profits in line with 
expectations, although lower than for the same period last year reflecting the increased cost of carbon. 
In accordance with our dividend policy, shareholders will receive an interim ordinary dividend of 8.7 
pence per share in October, equivalent to approximately £35 million. 
 
We started this year with our sights firmly set on converting our first generating unit to run on 
sustainable biomass in place of coal. The unit came on stream at the beginning of April and is 
performing to plan. We now have four months’ valuable experience operating the largest converted 
unit in the world, which is a significant achievement. 
 
We have set out plans to convert three of our six generating units and to become a predominantly 
biomass-fuelled generator. Much engineering and construction work is underway at the Drax Power 
Station site and we will start commissioning our new biomass receipt, storage and distribution systems 
later this year. 
 
More than ever we are convinced of the important role that biomass has to play in the UK energy mix. 
However, biomass fuel must be underpinned by very robust sustainability standards. We demonstrate 
this in our own sourcing and supply chain, and continue to advocate and support the requirement for 
mandatory standards across our industry. This is simply doing the right thing and should underpin 
confidence in what is a cost effective, low carbon and reliable source of renewable power.  
 
Downstream, our retail business continues to provide value to the Group as a direct, credit efficient 
route to market for our power, and increasingly our renewable power. Upstream, our developments in 
the US have started to take shape. Construction has started at our pellet plant site in Mississippi, 
whilst in Louisiana the second pellet plant site and the Baton Rouge port site are being mobilised for 
the start of construction. 
 
As always I should like to thank all Group staff for their contribution to what has been a successful first 
half of the year. 
 
 
 
 
 
Chief Executive’s statement 
 
Introduction 
Profits for the first half of the year are lower than profits in the first half of 2012, but in line with 
expectations. At the beginning of this year, we entered into Phase III of the EU ETS and no longer 
receive a free carbon allocation. In addition, the UK carbon tax came into effect in April. As a result our 
carbon costs are higher, with a consequent impact on our profits. This is all well understood by 
shareholders and the stock market. Through these increased costs and Government’s trajectory for 
increasing the UK carbon tax over time, there will be a growing downward pressure on the profitability 
of all coal-fired electricity generators. Expectations of our profit performance must be viewed in this 
context until biomass reaches an appropriate scale.    
 
The highlight of the first six months of the year is undoubtedly the conversion of our first generating 
unit to burn sustainable biomass in place of coal. The unit was brought into service at the beginning of 
April and is performing in line with plan and safely.  
 
Towards the end of April, we announced that we had agreed a £75 million amortising loan facility with 
Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury issued under the Infrastructure UK 
Guarantee Scheme, further enhancing our financing structure. 
 
Our good operational performance during the first half of the year has supported both our contracted 
position and our ability to take advantage of market opportunities. Trading conditions in the markets in 
which we operate have been favourable and we have strengthened our contracted position, more than 
doubling our forward power sales for 2014 since the beginning of the year. We are now almost fully 
hedged for 2013 and well advanced for 2014.  
 
Elsewhere in the business, we successfully concluded the contractual arrangements to commence 
construction of our two US-based pellet plants and of our US port facility. Finally, our retail business, 
Haven Power Limited (”Haven Power”), continues to provide a credit efficient route to market and has 
delivered significant growth in sales of almost 50% in the first half of the year. 
 
Commodity markets 
We have seen attractive dark green spreads, the difference between the price of power and the cost 
of coal and carbon, over the first six months of the year. The drivers for these attractive spreads are 
relatively stable gas and, therefore, power prices, very low coal prices and low carbon prices. 
However, as noted above, the introduction of both the full auctioning of EU emissions allowances from 
the start of the year and the UK carbon tax from April has increased costs for coal-fired generators. 
  
Market bark spreads, the difference between power price plus renewable support and the cost of 
biomass, have fallen this year, principally as a result of currency effects, with a weaker British Pound 
Sterling and most biomass used for large scale power generation priced in US dollars or Euros. We 
have implemented an extensive foreign currency hedging programme to support our biomass 
procurement activities as detailed in the Operational and financial performance review. 
 
Throughout the first half of the year, dark green spreads were higher than bark spreads. Looking 
forward, Government’s announced annual increase in the UK carbon tax, whilst strengthening the 
case for biomass generation, is likely to erode the competitive position of coal-fired generation plant. 
 
Generation performance 
Our safety performance continues to be industry-leading at a time of considerable project activity and 
outage work. The engineering and construction work associated with our biomass conversion has 
continued apace in the first half of the year and we have completed the first of our two major planned 
outages. Compared to the same period last year we have seen an increase of more than 50% in the 
number of man-hours worked at the power station site.  
 
 
 
 
We have enjoyed continued good operational performance from our coal units at Drax Power Station. 
Our load factor for the first half of the year has again been high compared to other coal and gas-fired 
plants, driven by our high efficiency, and the quality and competitiveness of the system support 
services we are able to offer the National Grid. 
 
First unit conversion 
After a one month outage to conduct the final stage of the necessary modifications to the boiler and 
through utilising, on a temporary basis, our existing biomass co-firing receipt, storage and handling 
systems, we started running our first converted biomass unit at the beginning of April.  
 
We are very pleased with the technical performance to date, which has been in line with plan. The unit 
has achieved output levels of up to 585MW (c.10% lower than coal) with no loss of flexibility. To date, 
we have not encountered significant slagging, fouling or corrosion inside the boiler. Emissions of 
nitrogen oxides have been significantly lower than for the coal units. The efficiency modifications we 
have made so far have been effective and the overall combustion process is stable.  
 
Technical availability of 76% and the outage rates set out in the Operational and financial performance 
review are largely as expected for this first newly converted unit. 
 
The load factor of 57% was significantly lower than we expect to deliver in the future. Normally, 
biomass units would be expected to have very high load factors when available, reflecting the 
favourable economics of biomass generation. However, logistics have been challenging and as a 
result generation from this converted unit was materially constrained over the period by fuel 
availability. This was due to the temporarily limited biomass storage facilities on-site, as well as the 
use of some temporary supply chain facilities off-site pending delivery of the permanent facilities.  
 
Later in the year we will begin a phased commissioning of the new on-site biomass receipt, storage 
and distribution systems, during which time we will gradually switch from the temporary arrangements 
to the purpose-built systems. 
 
We remain confident that average availability for the first converted unit will be 80% for 2013 and that, 
thereafter, we will begin to deliver performance in line with operational guidance previously provided. 
 
Next year will be characterised by continued transformation. We expect to enter 2014 with the first unit 
fuelled entirely by the new on-site systems and conversion work continuing on the second and third 
units. Our first 50 bespoke biomass rail wagons should be fully operational by the end of the first 
quarter and we are aiming to convert the second unit in the Summer. 
 
Retail performance 
Haven Power continues to provide us with a valuable, credit efficient alternative to trading through the 
wholesale market. Sales growth within the industrial and commercial, and small and medium 
enterprises markets remains the business priority. With significant growth achieved in the first half of 
the year we are confident in our ability to continue to grow our power sales to business customers. 
 
Biomass supply chain 
We continue to make good progress with our biomass sourcing. Further to securing the rights to 
sufficient fibre for the first unit conversion, we are well advanced with sourcing for the second unit and 
continue negotiations for the third.  
 
The work we are doing on sustainability criteria for the biomass we procure continues to be industry-
leading. All the biomass we source complies with our sustainability principles.  
 
Other areas of the biomass fuel supply chain, namely port, shipping and rail arrangements, are 
progressing well. Agreements are in place for the expansion of import capacity through UK ports. In 
addition to the existing facilities at Port of Tyne, construction is now underway at Hull and Immingham, 
and we have further expansion at other UK ports under negotiation. 
 
 
 
 
 
With the construction contracts concluded for our US pellet plants, one in each of the states of 
Louisiana (Morehouse) and Mississippi (Amite), we have now broken ground at Amite and expect to 
start construction at Morehouse in the Autumn. Construction of the port facility in Louisiana (Baton 
Rouge) is expected to begin shortly. We are targeting the first quarter of 2015 for the start of 
commercial operations at Amite and Baton Rouge and the second quarter for Morehouse, with full 
capacity reached six months later. 
 
Legislative and regulatory framework 
Sustainability criteria 
The Government’s response to its consultation on sustainability criteria for biomass is expected 
shortly. We continue to advocate the need for harmonised, mandatory sustainability criteria across the 
bioenergy sector. Through calculating the life cycle carbon footprint of all the biomass we buy, we are 
confident that we are delivering significant carbon savings compared to burning coal and further that 
our fibre sourcing strategy will meet the UK mandatory standard when it comes into effect.  
 
Energy Bill 
The Energy Bill, currently making its passage through Parliament, will enable the Government’s 
Electricity Market Reform (“EMR”) measures. In June 2013, the Government published some 
information on certain of the EMR measures, including further detail on the Feed-in Tariffs with 
Contracts for Difference (“CFD”) for renewable technologies and the Capacity Market.  
 
With respect to the CFD, draft strike prices and contract term principles were published. CFD are fixed 
price long-term contracts which, for new renewable investments, will replace the Renewables 
Obligation (“RO”) from April 2017. Some details were also given in relation to the Final Investment 
Decision (“FID”) Enabling CFD, which provides an alternative to the RO in advance of the CFD 
becoming available.  
 
Detailed design proposals for a Capacity Market to ensure security of electricity supply were also 
published. Subject to legislation and state aid clearance, the Government will run the first Capacity 
Market auction in 2014 for delivery of capacity from the Winter of 2018/19. All existing and new forms 
of capacity will be eligible to participate in the Capacity Market, except for capacity supported by CFD, 
small scale Feed-in Tariffs or the RO, and interconnected capacity, although the latter may be eligible 
in future. 
 
Earlier this month the draft EMR Delivery Plan was published for consultation. The document included 
information on the methodology and analysis behind the draft CFD strike prices, as well as the 
proposed draft reliability standard which will inform the level of capacity to be contracted through the 
Capacity Market. 
 
We welcome the options which may now be available to us to secure support for future unit 
conversions and for our coal-fired units to participate in the Capacity Market. We have long believed 
that the introduction of a CFD mechanism would create a more level playing field for investment in 
renewables by new entrants and independent generators, and represent good value for consumers.   
 
We will now engage fully in the consultation process and evaluate each of the options available. 
 
Industrial Emissions Directive 
Our work on the assessment of the options available to us for compliance with the more stringent 
emissions standards of the Industrial Emissions Directive from 2016 is well advanced. We remain on 
track to determine the optimal solution by the end of the year. 
 
Creating low cost options for the future 
We continue to pursue a number of low cost development options for the future. These include a 
fourth unit conversion at Drax, the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage (“CCS”) Project, securing 
new sites for further pellet plant and port facilities, and exploring options for alternative fuels and 
generation capacity. 
 
Evaluation of a fourth unit conversion at Drax is underway, including assessment of whether this 
would be best delivered through modification of our existing co-firing systems, currently being utilised 
for our first unit, or investment in new bespoke facilities. 
 
 
Together, Alstom UK Limited, Drax and BOC (a member of The Linde Group) have formed a 
consortium in support of the White Rose CCS Project, a proposed oxy-combustion CCS 
demonstration project of up to 450MW located at the Drax Power Station site. In March 2013, the 
Government announced that the project was one of two preferred bidders in the UK’s CCS 
Commercialisation Programme Competition. We are now in discussion with Government to agree 
terms for a Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) study. In addition, the Government submitted 
a funding application to the European Commission for the project under the second call of the 
European NER 300 programme.   
 
A final investment decision is unlikely to be taken until 2015 and will be dependent on successful 
outcomes of the FEED study and the funding processes, as well as the proposed EMR mechanism to 
incentivise low carbon technologies.  Whilst clearly an interesting and important project, we will only 
progress this investment if it delivers an appropriate return on capital, commensurate with any 
technical and commercial risks. 
 
We continue to develop our options for further investments in biomass pellet plant facilities and port 
facilities in locations including the US and Latin America.  
 
We believe that, as proposed, the UK Capacity Market has the potential to deliver attractive returns for 
investments. We will continue to assess these proposals and determine whether they give rise to any 
potentially valuable opportunities for the Group to benefit from our core competencies.   
 
Delivering leading operating and cost performance will continue to be a key focus of our efforts as we 
implement our strategy to change from being a coal-fired generator burning some biomass to being a 
biomass-fired generator burning some coal. Transforming Drax into a predominantly biomass-fuelled 
generator will secure an attractive future for our business and our shareholders. It will also deliver cost 
effective, low carbon and reliable renewable power, which is good for the consumer, good for the 
environment and good for security of supply.

Introduction 
EBITDA was £120 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 compared to £154 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2012.  
 
Our results for the first half of 2013 were supported by good operational performance. The expected 
reduction in profitability compared to last year reflects increased carbon costs, with the removal of free 
carbon allowances in 2013 under Phase III of the EU ETS and implementation of the UK carbon tax 
from April, together adding £46 million to cost of sales in the first six months of 2013. 
 
Looking forward, we have a strong near-term hedge in place through our contracted position, but 
earnings will be impacted by the increasing carbon costs until our biomass generation becomes more 
substantial. 
  
As described in the Chief Executive’s statement, our plans to become a predominantly biomass-fired 
power generator are well underway, with the successful conversion of our first unit in April. In support 
of these plans investment on-site at the Drax Power Station and through the biomass supply chain is 
continuing on schedule and is reflected in capital expenditure of £138 million in the first half of 2013 
(2012: £90 million). 
  
Our retail business, Haven Power, continues to deliver good volume growth with sales of 3.6TWh in 
the six months to 30 June 2013 compared to 2.5TWh during the same period in 2012. 
 
Following much work last year and this, the balance sheet is strong.  In April we agreed a £75 million 
amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the 
Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaces £50 million of the £100 million amortising loan 
facility agreed with the UK Green Investment Bank, which was signed in December 2012. With the full 
£225 million of term loans under our financing structure now drawn down, net cash at 30 June 2013 
was £245 million.  
 
The Board has resolved to pay an interim dividend for 2013 of 8.7 pence per share (£35 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2013, compared to 14.4 pence per share (£53 million) for the six

Generation results 
Revenue 
Total generation revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was £785 million compared to £794 
million in 2012. Total generation revenue in 2013 includes power sales of £770 million (2012: £766 
million), ROC and LEC sales of £2 million (2012: £17 million), ancillary services income of £6 million 
(2012: £6 million) and other income of £8 million (2012: £5 million). 
 
Net power sold decreased to 12.6TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2013, compared to 13.6TWh 
in 2012, at a lower average achieved price of electricity of £50.1 per MWh this year, compared to 
£52.0 per MWh in 2012, resulting in an overall reduction in power sales from electricity generated. 
However, total power sales for 2013 also include £139 million of sales met through purchasing 
additional power in the market (see Cost of power purchases below) in comparison to £59 million in 
2012. 
 
Our average achieved price of electricity reflects our contracted position at the start of the year, as 
well as power prices during the first six months of the year. The decrease in achieved price is 
therefore a function of the timing of our sales and reflects the fall in gas and power prices towards the 
end of 2011. 
 
ROC and LEC sales have decreased from £17 million in the six months to 30 June 2012 to £2 million 
in 2013. The timing of ROC sales is largely driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation 
deadlines and commercial considerations. Where ROCs and LECs have been generated but not sold 
they are held on the balance sheet. ROC and LEC assets at 30 June 2013 were £60 million compared 
to £41 million at 30 June 2012. 
 
Generation revenue also includes income from the provision of ancillary services and the sale of by-
products (ash and gypsum). In the six months ended 30 June 2013 these revenues were £14 million 
compared to £11 million in 2012. 
 
Fuel costs (coal, biomass and other fuels) 
Fuel costs in respect of generation were £409 million during the six months ended 30 June 2013 
(2012: £456 million) with approximately 4.3 million tonnes of coal burnt in 2013 compared to 4.6 
million tonnes for the same period in 2012. This coal was purchased from a variety of domestic and 
international sources under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities. 
 
In 2013, we burnt 0.4 million tonnes of biomass compared to 0.5 million tonnes during the same period 
in 2012. In 2013 most of the biomass relates to volumes burnt in our newly converted unit since April, 
whereas most of last year’s burn (0.4 million tonnes) related to our biomass trials. 
 
In addition, we burnt 0.3 million tonnes of pond fines during the first six months of 2013 (2012: 0.4 
million tonnes). Pond fines are a coal mining residue, which trades at a significant discount to coal, 
requiring specific blending and handling techniques to burn in large volumes. 
 
Coal comprised around 88% of total fuel burnt (by energy content) in the six months ended 30 June 
2013 compared to 87% in 2012. Biomass comprised 7% of total fuel burnt in both years. 
 
Our average cost of fuel per MWh (excluding CO2 emissions allowances) was £26.9 for the six months 
ended 30 June 2013, compared to £30.7 in 2012. The decrease in average fuel prices was largely 
driven by falling international coal prices, where continued over supply in the global traded market 
reflects high levels of US exports.  
 
The impact of this price reduction was partially offset in the second quarter by the implementation of 
the UK carbon tax in April. The tax is charged as a levy on our coal deliveries and is recognised in the 
income statement as an additional fuel cost when we burn the related coal. The associated charge to 
the income statement was £14 million for the period to 30 June 2013. 
 
 
 
 
The net cost of biomass represents an increasingly important element of our fuel costs. There are two 
parts to this cost; the gross cost of biomass delivered to the plant and the offsetting value of ROCs 
and LECs earned through burning biomass. The value of ROCs and LECs earned is recognised as a 
reduction in biomass costs in the period the related biomass is burnt. ROCs and LECs are held on the 
balance sheet within ROC and LEC assets until sold. Upon sale, income is recognised in revenue and 
a cost of sale recorded within fuel costs for the balance sheet value of the ROC or LEC. 
 
Fuel costs (CO2 emissions allowances) 
From 2013, we entered Phase III of the EU ETS, with no national CO2 emissions allowances 
allocation. We purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity 
dates from a variety of domestic and international sources. 
 
Our CO2 emissions allowances requirement for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was 
approximately 10.2 million tonnes, all of which were purchased. Our requirement for the first half of 
2012 was 11.2 million tonnes, of which 6.5 million tonnes were purchased and 4.7 million tonnes 
allocated free under the UK NAP. 
 
The average price expensed for purchased CO2 emissions allowances during the six months ended 
30 June 2013 was £6.9 per tonne, compared to £5.9 per tonne in 2012, reflecting the timing of 
purchases under fixed price contracts in the forward and near-term markets. As a result, the cost of 
carbon allowances was £70 million in 2013 compared to only £38 million in 2012. 
 
Cost of power purchases 
We purchase power in the market when the cost of power in the market is below our marginal cost of 
production in respect of power previously contracted for generation and delivery by us, and to cover 
any shortfall in generation. For the six months ended 30 June 2013, the net cost of purchased power 
for the generation business was £139 million compared to £59 million incurred in 2012. 
 
Grid charges 
Generation grid charges for the six months ended 30 June 2013 were £31 million compared to £32 
million in 2012. 
 
As a result of these factors, generation gross profit for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was 
£207 million compared to £247 million in 2012. 
 
Operating and administrative expenses 
Generation other operating and administrative expenses before depreciation and amortisation were 
£86 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 compared to £91 million in 2012. 
 
The higher costs in the first half of 2012 included our obligations under the Community Energy Saving 
Programme, which ended in December 2012 (see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial 
statements). 
 
We continue to carefully control our cost base with our full year Group operating cost estimate 
(including retail operating costs) unchanged at £215 million. 
 
Generation EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was therefore £121 million 
compared to £157 million in 2012. 
 
 
 
 
 
Retail results 
Revenue 
Haven Power have realised substantial growth so far this year, with sales volumes increasing from 
2.5TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2012 to 3.6TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2013. This 
reflects planned growth in Haven Power’s industrial and commercial customer base, along with growth 
in our sales to the small and medium enterprises market. As a result, retail sales revenue increased by 
almost 50% to £323 million for the six months to 30 June 2013 compared to £219 million in 2012. 
 
Cost of power purchases 
Retail cost of power purchases for the six months ended 30 June 2013 were £195 million compared to 
£139 million incurred in 2012, reflecting the rise in sales volumes. 
 
Grid charges 
Higher retail volumes, alongside increased charges, have also driven a rise in grid charges for the 
retail business to £72 million in the six months to 30 June 2013, from £49 million in 2012. 
 
Other retail cost of sales 
Other retail costs include broker fees, ROCs, LECs, metering and Feed-in Tariff (“FiT”) costs and were 
£47 million in the six months ended 30 June 2013, compared to £25 million in 2012. In addition to 
higher volumes, expenditure continues to grow due to the increasing FiT levelisation costs being 
charged to suppliers. 
 
As a result of these factors, retail gross profit for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was £9 
million compared to £7 million in 2012. 
 
Operating and administrative expenses 
Retail other operating and administrative expenses before depreciation and amortisation were £10 
million for both the six months ended 30 June 2013 and 2012. 
 
Retail EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was, therefore, a loss of £1 million 
compared to a loss of £3 million in 2012. 
 
 
 
 
 
Central costs 
Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation and amortisation was £29 million for the six months ended 30 June 2013 and £28 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2012. 
 
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 
The Group recognises unrealised gains and losses on forward contracts which meet the definition of 
derivatives under IFRSs. Where possible, we take the own use exemption for derivative contracts 
entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward biomass 
and domestic coal contracts. 
 
Mark-to-market movements on our derivative contracts that are considered to be effective hedges 
have been recognised through the hedge reserve, a component of shareholders’ equity in the balance 
sheet. Movements in unrealised gains and losses recognised in the hedge reserve are mainly the 
result of unwinding mark-to-market positions relating to power and carbon delivered during the 
reporting period, and the recording of mark-to-market positions on power and carbon yet to be 
delivered at the end of the period. 
 
The unrealised gains and losses recognised in the income statement arise from mark-to-market 
movements on our derivative contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting; largely foreign 
exchange and financial coal.  
 
The following table describes the movements in unrealised gains and losses and where they are 
recorded in our financial statements.

A weaker US dollar, relative to Sterling, at 31 December 2012 drove the net unrealised loss position 
recognised in the balance sheet at the start of 2013, which incorporated the mark-to-market position 
on a number of our foreign exchange contracts. These contracts reflect an extensive foreign currency 
hedging programme to support our biomass procurement activities. The programme covers all 
contracted and a substantial proportion of as yet uncontracted but forecast purchases and provides a 
significant degree of protection from adverse currency movements. 
 
As the US dollar strengthened against Sterling during 2013, the unrealised loss position has reversed. 
With the majority of this movement relating to portions of the derivative contracts which do not qualify 
for hedge accounting, this gave rise to the £122 million unrealised gain recognised through the income 
statement during the first half of this year. 
 
Power prices have remained relatively stable during the period, whereas carbon prices have fallen 
since the end of 2012. This resulted in an increase in the net unrealised loss position on our contracts 
which do qualify for hedge accounting, and is reflected in the £33 million loss recognised through the 
hedge reserve in the period. 
 
 
 
 
 
In summary, after the changes in commodity prices and currency rates so far this year, the principal 
components of a net unrealised loss of £21 million recognised in the balance sheet at 30 June 2013 
are unrealised losses on our carbon contracts and unrealised losses on financial coal contracts which 
have remained at a similar level to year end, largely offset by unrealised gains under our foreign 
exchange programme. Following a period of relatively stable power prices, the unrealised loss on our 
power book is not currently significant.  
 
In considering mark-to-market movements, it is important to recognise that profitability is driven by our 
strategy to deliver market level dark green or bark spreads, not by the absolute price of electricity at 
any given date. 
 
After allowing for depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts, operating profit for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was £214 million compared 
to £147 million in 2012. 
 
Interest 
Net finance costs for the six months ended 30 June 2013 were £8 million compared to £5 million in 
2012.  
 
The higher costs in 2013 reflect interest incurred during the period on our new term loans, as 
described in Capital resources and refinancing. 
 
Tax 
The tax charge for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was £42 million (an effective rate of 20%). This 
includes previous years’ research and development tax relief, now agreed with HMRC, resulting in a 
£6 million credit recognised in the period. The tax charge for the first six months of 2012 was £20 
million (an effective rate of 14%). This included the impact of a reduction in the corporation tax rate to 
24% from April 2012 on current and deferred tax liabilities and a revision to previous years’ capital 
allowances claims, resulting in a further £8 million tax credit. 
 
It is likely that our underlying effective tax rate for the full year will be relatively low as the Group will 
benefit from the research and development tax relief noted above, together with tax credits arising as 
we revalue our net deferred tax liability down to the 20% corporation tax rate which will be legislated in 
the second half of 2013. In future years we would expect our underlying tax rates to be more closely 
aligned with standard corporate tax rates.  
 
Profit for the period and earnings per share 
 
As a result of the above factors, profit attributable to equity shareholders for the six months 
ended 30 June 2013 was £164 million, compared to £121 million in 2012, and basic and diluted 
earnings per share were 41 pence and 40 pence, respectively, compared to 33 pence, basic and 
diluted, in 2012. 
 
Underlying profit attributable to equity shareholders (that is profit excluding the after tax impact of 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts) was £70 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2013 compared to £106 million in 2012. Underlying basic and diluted earnings per share were 17 
pence in 2013 compared to 29 pence in 2012.

Notes: 
The forced outage rate is expressed as a percentage of planned capacity available (that is, it includes a reduction for planned 
losses). The planned outage rate is expressed as a percentage of registered capacity. 
 
Coal plant availability of 82% for the six months ended 30 June 2013 (2012: 85%) demonstrates our 
continuing leadership position in the coal-fired generation sector.  
 
The forced outage rate of 7.6% for our coal plant for the six months ended 30 June 2013 is higher 
than our long-term target of 5%. We have continued to test a wide variety of advantaged fuels, for 
example coals with lower cost than the standard bituminous coal that we burn. Although some of 
these fuels have resulted in a higher number of plant integrity issues than we typically experience, the 
testing work is an important component of our drive to optimise value from our fuel mix, as well as the 
work to define our solution for compliance with the Industrial Emissions Directive (see Chief 
Executive’s statement). 
 
The planned outage rate for the coal plant for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was 11.1% 
compared to 10.8% in 2012. Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our 
six units once every four years. Consequently, there is an irregular pattern to planned outages and 
associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will each undergo a major planned 
outage. We completed the first of two major planned outages for each year in the first six months of 
2012 and 2013. 
 
The resulting coal plant load factor was 78% for the period, which compares well with the average for 
other UK coal and gas plants and reflects our good availability and plant despatch economics. 
 
At the beginning of April our first converted biomass unit was brought into service, utilising our existing 
biomass co-firing receipt, storage and handling systems. We have been pleased with the technical 
performance so far, which is in line with plan. 
  
Availability for the period was 76%, with the issues driving the forced outage rate of 13.1% largely as 
expected for a newly converted unit. The planned outage rate of 12.9% reflects scheduled inspection 
work as well as the impact of a suspension of fuel deliveries to allow for work to be completed on our 
rail loop upgrade. 
 
As described in the Chief Executive’s statement, the load factor for the period of 57% was significantly 
lower than we expect to achieve in the future. Logistics have been challenging for our temporary 
systems, with only limited on-site storage available until the new systems are operational. In addition, 
reliability issues with coal wagons converted to transport biomass have further restricted fuel 
deliveries, with only limited capacity in place to receive biomass by road. As a result, operation from 
this first converted unit was materially constrained over the period by fuel availability.  
 
Later in the year we will be commencing a phased commissioning of the new biomass receipt, storage 
and distribution systems and we expect the first unit to operate entirely on the new on-site systems by 
the end of the year. The first two sets of our new rail wagons will also be fully operational by the end of 
the first quarter in 2014. We remain confident that average availability for the first converted unit will 
improve to around 80% for 2013 and that thereafter we will begin to deliver performance in line with 
the operational guidance previously provided. 
 
 
 
 
The load factor for the plant as a whole for the six months ended 30 June 2013 was 77% compared to 
82% in 2012, reflecting a decrease in electrical output (net sales) to 12.6TWh in 2013, compared with 
the record output of 13.6TWh in 2012. 
 
Health and safety 
Our lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate were 0.09 and 0.23, respectively, for the six 
months ended 30 June 2013 compared to 0.04 and 0.13 in 2012. These industry-leading safety 
statistics have been delivered against a backdrop of an increase of more than 50% in man-hours 
worked in the first half of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. 
 
Liquidity and capital resources 
Net cash including short-term investments was £245 million at 30 June 2013 compared to £311 million 
at 31 December 2012 and £233 million at 30 June 2012. Cash and short-term investments were £460 
million as at 30 June 2013, compared to £402 million at 31 December 2012 and £241 million at 30 
June 2012. An analysis of cash flows is set out in the table below.

Cash generated from operations was £129 million in the six months ended 30 June 2013 compared to 
£163 million in 2012, driven by a decrease of £34 million in EBITDA, as described above. 
 
Net income taxes paid were £13 million in the six months ended 30 June 2013 compared to £30 
million in 2012. 2012 and 2013 payments included settlement of the 2011 and 2012 liability, 
respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 
Net cash used in investing activities includes payments in respect of capital expenditure of £133 
million in the six months ended 30 June 2013 and £77 million in 2012 (see Capital expenditure). 2013 
includes a decrease of £10 million in short-term investments compared to a £20 million decrease in 
2012, comprising cash deposits with a maturity of more than three months at inception. 
 
Net cash flows from financing activities of £81 million in the six months ended 30 June 2013, consisted 
of £125 million of new borrowings (see Capital resources and refinancing) and equity dividends paid of 
£44 million. Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended 30 June 2012 was £43 
million, being equity dividends paid. 
 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents was, therefore, £68 million in the six months ended 30 
June 2013, compared to an increase of £29 million in 2012. Drax’s policy is to invest available cash in 
short-term bank, building society or other low risk deposits. 
 
Capital resources and refinancing 
In April 2013 we agreed a new £75 million amortising term loan facility, maturing in June 2018, with 
Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee 
Scheme. This replaces £50 million of the £100 million amortising term loan facility agreed with the 
Green Investment Bank, signed in December 2012. 
 
The new loan facility enhances the existing financing structure executed last year by providing 
additional liquidity to the Group and ensuring a smoother profile of debt maturities. Furthermore, the 
all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive.  
 
The financing structure also incorporates the remaining £50 million amortising term loan from the 
Green Investment Bank, a £100 million amortising term loan facility with the M&G UK Companies 
Financing Fund and a £400 million working capital and letter of credit facility. The term loans have 
varying maturity profiles ranging from four to eight years, whilst the working capital and letter of credit 
facility is due to mature in April 2016. 
 
In addition, a commodity trading facility also executed in December 2012, allows us to transact 
prescribed volumes of commodity trades at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral. 
This facility has been operating well during the first half of the year, offering trading counterparties 
uncapped access to the security package available to our senior lenders. Combined with other steps 
taken over the past three years to limit our requirements to post collateral, this is allowing the Group to 
operate comfortably at sub-investment grade level. 
 
Going concern 
We acknowledge guidance on going concern for companies preparing financial statements. We have 
significant headroom in our new banking facilities, a recent history of cash generation, strong covenant 
compliance and good visibility in near-term forecasts due to our progressive hedging strategy. Our 
Business Plan, taking account of our capital investment plans and reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, shows that we should be able to operate within the level of our current banking 
facilities. 
After considering the principal risks and uncertainties set out below, the directors are satisfied that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a 
period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Half year report. 
 
Seasonality of borrowing 
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the Winter period and lower 
despatch in the Summer months, when prices are lower and plant availability is affected by planned 
outages. 
 
Accordingly, cash flow during the Summer months is materially reduced due to the combined effect of 
lower prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are increased during this period due to major 
planned outages. As noted above (Capital resources and refinancing), we have a £400 million working 
capital and letter of credit facility, and it is envisaged that this facility will assist in managing the cash

Additions in 2013 include £67 million for on-site biomass infrastructure at the Drax Power Station site. 
This work includes construction of new biomass fuel receipt, storage and distribution systems, 
sufficient to handle the 7 to 8 million tonnes of fuel per annum required for three converted units. We 
expect construction work on the remaining on-site infrastructure to be largely complete by the end of 
2014. 
 
A further £31 million of capital expenditure in the period relates to investment in our US Gulf based 
pellet operations. We are developing two pellet plants, with a combined capacity of 900,000 tonnes of 
pellet production per annum, and a port facility with export capacity of up to 3 million tonnes per 
annum. We are targeting the first half of 2015 for commercial operations to begin at these facilities. 
 
Expected full year capital expenditure for 2013 continues to be in the region of £250 million to £300 
million, including £50 million for plant efficiency and other projects unrelated to our biomass plans. 
 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
We manage the commercial and operational risks faced by the Group in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board. We set out in our 2012 Annual report and accounts (pages 32–35) the 
principal risks and uncertainties that could impact performance. These remain unchanged, and are as 
follows: 
 
 
Commodity market price risk 
 
Counterparty risk 
 
Power and renewables market liquidity risk 
 
Biomass market risk 
 
Plant operating risk 
 
Regulatory and political risk 
 
Related parties 
The Group set out in its 2012 Annual report and accounts (page 122) the related party transactions 
arising. There have been no material changes since the Annual report and accounts were published. 
 
 
 
 
 
Positions under contract for 2013, 2014 and 2015 
We continue to follow our stated trading strategy of making steady forward power sales with 
corresponding purchases of CO2 emissions allowances and fuel purchases. Our aim is to deliver 
market level dark green or bark spreads across all traded market periods and, as part of this strategy, 
we retain power to be sold into the prompt (within season) power markets. As at 22 July 2013, the 
commodity positions under contract for 2013, 2014 and 2015 were as set out below.

2013 to 22 July 2013 under the five year 300MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 October 
2010. 
 
Fixed margin power sales include approximately 1.3TWh in 2013, 2.6TWh in 2014 and 1.9TWh in 
2015, in connection with the above contracts. 
 
Under these contracts the Group will supply power on terms which include Centrica paying for coal, 
based on international coal prices, and delivering matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting in 
aggregate to approximately 2.4 million tonnes in 2013 and 2014 and approximately 1.8 million tonnes 
in 2015. 
 
The contracts provide the Group with a series of fixed dark green spreads, with the spreads having 
been agreed in October 2009. 
 
Distributions 
Distribution policy 
The Board has previously committed to target a pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying earnings (being 
profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts) in each year. Underlying earnings for the period ending 30 June 
2013 were £70 million. 
 
Dividends paid 
On 18 February 2013, the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 24 April 2013, to pay a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 10.9 pence 
per share (£44 million). The final dividend was subsequently paid on 17 May 2013. 
 
Dividends proposed 
On 29 July 2013, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 
2013 of 8.7 pence per share (£35 million), representing 50% of underlying earnings for the period. The 
interim dividend will be paid on or before 11 October 2013 and shares will be marked ex-interim 
dividend on 25 September 2013.

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
 
1. General information 
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. 
The Company and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and 
supply industry within the UK. The address of the Company’s registered office and principal 
establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. 
 
2. Basis of preparation 
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies 
consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and in accordance with IAS 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting”. 
 
The information for the year ended 31 December 2012 does not constitute statutory accounts as 
defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has 
been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not 
qualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements 
under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
The condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board on 29 July 2013. 
 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In 2012, a number of new standards and interpretations became effective as noted in the 2012 Annual 
report and accounts (page 89). The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had 
a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.  
 
Since the 2012 Annual report and accounts was published no significant new standards and 
interpretations have been issued. The following new and revised standards became effective during 
2013: 
 
- 
IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013. 
- 
IFRS 11 “Joint arrangements” - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2013. 
- 
IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” - effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013. 
- 
IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2013. 
- 
IAS 19 (revised) “Employee benefits” - effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2013. 
 
The adoption of these standards has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group.  
 
3. Significant accounting policies 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s 
Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012. 
 
4. Segmental reporting 
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment 
decisions is organised into two operating segments. The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 
are as follows: 
 
Generation – the generation of electricity at the Drax Power Station. 
 
Retail – the supply of electricity to retail customers in the small and medium enterprise and 
industrial and commercial markets. 
 
 
 
 
 
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular basis 
is EBITDA, with sales between segments being carried out at arm’s length. Assets and working capital 
are monitored on a Group basis with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the 
management accounts, and hence no separate asset disclosure is provided in this Half year report.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies 
which are described in the Group’s latest Annual report and accounts. The revenue and results of both 
segments are subject to seasonality as detailed in the Operational and financial performance review. 
 
Major customers 
Total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2013 includes £106.3 million derived from one 
customer (2012: £217.5 million derived from one customer), representing 10% or more of the Group’s 
revenue for the period.  
 
5. Taxation 
The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before taxation for the Group 
and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the period, so far as it relates to items recognised in 
the income statement.  
 
Changes in the rate of corporation tax 
Following the announcement of the 2012 Budget, the Finance Act 2012 (the “Act”) was enacted by 
Parliament in July 2012. The Act confirmed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% 
from April 2012, and from 24% to 23% from April 2013. 
 
In the 2013 Budget, the Government proposed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 23% to 
21% from 1 April 2014, and a further reduction in corporation tax to 20% from 1 April 2015. These 
reductions have not been recognised in the condensed consolidated financial statements as they had 
not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

6. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. In calculating diluted 
earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is 
adjusted, when relevant, to take account of share options and contingently issuable shares in relation 
to the Group’s share-based incentive plans. The underlying earnings per share has been calculated 
after excluding the after tax impact of marking-to-market derivative contracts which are not hedged. 
 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set 
out below.

Refinancing  
As set out in our latest Annual report and accounts, in December 2012 we completed the refinancing 
of our revolving credit facilities which were due to mature in April 2014. This facility was replaced with 
a larger £400m revolving credit facility which matures in April 2016 and can be used for both letters of 
credit and working capital purposes. In addition to this facility we executed two new committed term 
loans of £100 million each with the Prudential M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and the UK Green 
Investment Bank. The loans have six to eight year maturities. At the same time as concluding the 
financing arrangements above, we also executed a commodities trading line, which allows trading 
counterparties to benefit from the security package offered to senior lenders rather than Drax posting 
collateral for certain volumes of trades. The Prudential M&G UK Companies Financing Fund loan was 
fully drawn down at the year end. 
 
On 24 April 2013 we announced that we had agreed a £75 million amortising loan facility maturing in 
June 2018 with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury issued under the 
Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaces £50 million of the £100 million amortising loan 
facility agreed with the UK Green Investment Bank, signed in December 2012. 
 
The remaining £50 million UK Green Investment Bank loan and the £75 million Friends Life loan were 
fully drawn down on 29 and 30 April 2013, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9. Financial instruments 
The Group’s financial instruments consist of borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise 
directly from its operations and derivative contracts. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term 
investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables generally have short times to 
maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate 
principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate 
their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.  
 
The fair values of the Group’s derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market and 
recorded in the balance sheet were as follows:

As described in full in our latest Annual report and accounts, the fair value of commodity contracts and 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward 
market prices and the contract price, therefore these contracts have been grouped into Level 2 within 
the fair value hierarchy in their entirety. 
 
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values derived solely from unadjusted quoted prices 
(Level 1) or unobservable inputs (Level 3). There have been no transfers of any assets or liabilities 
between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the current or preceding period. 
 
10. Hedge reserve 
The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power), 
forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. Amounts are recognised in the hedge 
reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion 
of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve 
are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. 
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. 
 
The expected release from equity of post‑tax hedging gains and losses is as follows:

12. Contingent liabilities 
Community Energy Saving Programme  
Drax Power Limited (“Drax Power”) was obliged under the Electricity and Gas (Community Energy 
Saving Programme) Order 2009 (“CESP”) to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers 
in specific low income areas of Great Britain during the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012 
(the “Obligation period”). Drax Power’s obligation was to deliver 895,138 lifetime tonnes of CO2 
savings. It entered into an agreement with a third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged 
to deliver its CESP obligation, for a total cost of £17 million. The third party has failed to comply fully 
with its obligation under the agreement, leaving a significant shortfall against the CESP obligation. 
Drax Power intends to commence legal proceedings for breach of contract against the third party. 
 
Drax Power entered into further agreements with additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall 
so far as practicable. Having taken account of the additional measures under those arrangements, the 
Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”) announced in May 2013 that Drax Power had 
achieved 37.1% of its CESP target at the end of the Obligation period.  At the same time Ofgem also 
announced that it was launching an investigation into those companies that had failed to achieve their 
energy efficiency targets, including Drax Power. 
 
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (“the Authority”) is the enforcement authority in relation to 
CESP. Subject to the findings of Ofgem’s investigation, it will produce a statement of case or decide 
that there is no case to answer. In the case of the former, a recommendation to an enforcement 
committee of the Authority will be made on enforcement action. The Authority has wide powers of 
enforcement, including issuing a penalty or other means of enforcement. Ofgem has also indicated 
that a settlement committee of the Authority will be established to consider proposals made by 
obligated parties to settle investigations.  
 
Representatives of Drax Power had an initial meeting with the Ofgem enforcement team in June 2013, 
following which it has received a formal information request.  Drax Power will co-operate fully with the 
investigation.  At this stage, it is not possible to predict accurately what, if any, enforcement action 
may be taken. 
 
In the absence of any communication on enforcement subject to the findings of the investigation, it is 
not practicable to measure reliably the financial impact, if any. Accordingly, no provision has been 
recognised within these condensed consolidated financial statements in relation to this matter.
