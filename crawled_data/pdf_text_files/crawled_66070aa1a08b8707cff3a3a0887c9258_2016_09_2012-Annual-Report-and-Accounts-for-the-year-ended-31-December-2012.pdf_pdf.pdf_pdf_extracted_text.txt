Overview

We have long believed that generating electricity from sustainable biomass has 
great potential and that it should have an important role as a low carbon, cost-effective 
and reliable renewable technology in the future energy mix of the UK. We are determined 
that Drax should be a leading provider of this attractive renewable power for the UK. 
Chairman’s introduction
Signiﬁcant progress…
In 2012, we built on the work of previous years to deliver 
solid foundations for the Group’s future as a major 
renewable generator. We made significant progress with 
very encouraging results in our biomass research and 
development and we secured committed financing for 
our strategic capital investment from our shareholders 
and lenders. This was possible because the UK 
Government delivered certainty through decisions 
on the new regulatory framework for electricity 
generation from biomass. We have now moved ﬁrmly 
into execution of our plans to transform the business 
into a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator.
Although much effort in the year was focused on our 
biomass strategy and future, we did not neglect our 
other key priorities and I am pleased to say that once 
again I can report a year of strong operational and 
trading performance across the business. Our earnings 
(EBITDA(1)) of £298 million for 2012 were lower than 
in 2011 (£334 million). However, this includes a year-
on-year increase in gross margin, with a record level 
of generation at the power station, offset at EBITDA 
level by higher operating costs due to the two planned 
outages and costs incurred in accelerating our plans to 
convert our first generating unit to biomass in April 2013. 
In accordance with our dividend policy, the Board 
proposes a final dividend in respect of 2012 of 10.9 pence 
per share, equivalent to £44 million. This would give total 
dividends for the year of £97 million (2011: £102 million).
Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”), our electricity 
retail company serving business customers, again 
made good progress and delivered sizeable growth 
in its sales in 2012 compared to the previous year. 
We have been pleased with the way the business has 
developed and with it the value that the Group is now 
deriving from its success. Over time Haven Power will 
play an increasingly important role as a credit efﬁcient, 
direct sales channel for our power.
Another strong year of generation performance saw 
record levels of generation output for the power station 
and a double planned outage accomplished in good 
time. At all times our focus on high safety standards was 
maintained and despite the significant number of man-
hours worked due to the outages and project activity 
our safety performance remained industry-leading. 
This is the fifth year running that I have made reference 
to the £100 million turbine upgrade project, and I make 
no apology for reporting on the completion of the 
largest steam turbine modernisation project in UK 
history. Drax Power Station is now benefiting from 
an overall improvement in its efficiency of 5% and a 
consequent reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide 
amounting to 1 million tonnes each year. 
A testament to the diligence, expertise and teamwork 
of our engineers, this achievement is a clear 
demonstration of our competence in project execution. 
On governance-related matters, I am pleased to 
welcome a new member to our Board. Melanie Gee 
joined the Board on 1 January 2013 as a non-executive 
director, bringing with her many years’ experience 
in corporate ﬁnance. Her expertise will be a valuable 
addition and will strengthen further the proﬁciency 
of the Board.
I am, however, sorry to announce that Tim Barker will 
be stepping down from the Board at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting in April. Tim is 
bowing out after nine years of service, joining us at 
a formative time for the Company and assisting us 
through the Listing process. My sincere thanks go 
to Tim for his time, commitment and considerable 
contribution to the Group. The Board has appointed 
David Lindsell to take over from Tim as Senior 
Independent Director, and Tony Thorne as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, each with effect 
from Tim’s retirement from the Board. 
We have always recognised that our people are a key 
resource to the business, but I believe the milestone 
achievements of last year underline that sentiment. 
The many and varied disciplines that make up our 
business continued to demonstrate true commitment 
to delivering on our key priorities and preparing the 
ground for our future. My sincere thanks go to all 
Group staff for their devotion and hard work.

Drax is principally a power generation business responsible for meeting around 7% 
of the UK’s electricity demand. Owning and operating the largest power station in 
the UK, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. Through transforming 
the business into a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, we aim to provide low 
carbon, low cost and reliable renewable power well into the future. 
At the other end of the supply chain, through our retail business, Haven Power, 
we serve the electricity needs of businesses of all sizes. Our intention is to grow 
a signiﬁcant retail presence in the business sector providing us with a direct route 
to market for an increasing proportion of our power.

Our business model
Maximising value…
Our overriding objective is to maximise the value of the Drax business whilst 
increasing our electricity generation from sustainable biomass, thereby reducing 
our carbon footprint.
Our proﬁtability is determined by both the difference between the price at which 
we sell our power and the cost of coal and carbon, known as the “dark green 
spread”, and increasingly by the “bark spread”, which is the difference between 
the power price and the cost of biomass plus renewable support.
From this starting point there are several steps in the Drax value chain, with each 
one providing incremental value to the business and ultimately maximising the 
value of our business and delivering our gross margin.
Trading
How we maximise value…
As the largest power station in the UK we 
are able to utilise economies of scale through, 
for example, procuring fuel at competitive prices. 
We are always looking to increase the trading 
options available to us, for example, through our 
retail business. We beneﬁt from having a physical 
asset to trade around and through a seamless 
interface with the operations side of the business 
we derive value from our power station’s high 
availability and ﬂexibility, enabling us to extract 
value even when market conditions are poor.
Retail
How we maximise value…
We have already achieved signiﬁcant growth 
in a competitive marketplace and have become 
established as a recognised supplier by businesses 
across the UK. We have plans to grow further 
and deliver our tailor-made supply contracts 
to even more business customers. Our retail 
business increases the trading options available 
for our power output, providing an important, 
credit-efﬁcient and direct route to market.
Environment
How we maximise value…
We strive to be at the forefront of environmental 
performance in order to maintain our commercial 
and environmental leadership position in the  
coal-ﬁred sector. Through burning sustainable 
biomass and our efﬁciency improvements we 
are able to reduce the amount of coal we burn, 
save on carbon costs and reduce emissions of 
CO2. We generate revenue through sales of our 
by-products. We aim to maximise sales of ash 
produced from burning coal, which not only 
saves on landﬁll costs, but creates its own 
revenue stream. By reducing emissions of SO2, 
through our ﬂue gas desulphurisation process, 
we produce gypsum which, like ash, is sold to 
the construction industry. 
Generation
How we maximise value…
Through the completion of the £100 million 
turbine upgrade project we have secured our 
position as the most efﬁcient coal-ﬁred power 
station in the UK, and with it we are delivering 
coal and CO2 savings. With leading operational 
performances across all aspects of the generation 
business, from safety to maintenance, we are 
able to deliver high availability and reliability. 
In addition, the ﬂexibility of our despatch allows 
us to respond quickly to changes in demand. 
Together these characteristics mean we are 
consistently there when needed, both to meet 
our contractual positions and to provide support 
services critical to security of supply. 
Fuel
How we maximise value…
For the last ten years we have burnt sustainable 
biomass in place of some of our coal, when 
economic to do so. Beyond biomass, we also 
have the ability to burn other fuels, such as 
petcoke and pond ﬁnes, which can be 
economically advantageous. By diversifying 
our fuel sources not only are we less reliant on 
a single fuel type, we are also able to capture 
value from commodity market cycles, and in 
the case of biomass avoid the cost of carbon.

Introduction
I am very pleased to say that 2012 was a good and extremely important year 
for the Group. Good in the sense that the business performed well delivering 
proﬁts in line with expectations underpinned by continued strength in operations, 
and important in that we now have the clear mandate, means and expertise to 
transform Drax into a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator.
Through the year we made excellent progress with our biomass research and 
development work. We demonstrated that we could operate a single generating 
unit on a fully converted basis for a sustained period and we delivered very 
encouraging results from our engineering optimisation work. As a result 
we gained full conﬁdence in our ability to deliver reliable and ﬂexible renewable 
power through converted units at attractive rates of efﬁciency and output.
The much needed regulatory clarity and certainty was delivered in the 
Government’s conclusions on the future support levels for biomass electricity 
and proposals for sustainability criteria, which saw clear recognition of the 
true beneﬁts of biomass and its potential to play a strategically important 
role in the UK’s future energy mix. 
The ﬁnal piece of the jigsaw, securing the means to ﬁnance our biomass strategy, 
was achieved through raising a mixture of equity and debt. Equity of £190 million 
was raised through a share placing, and we secured new debt of £200 million 
through term loan facilities with M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and the 
UK Green Investment Bank, at £100 million each. In addition, our working capital/
letter of credit facility was increased to £400 million and the maturity extended 
to April 2016. 
All in all, 2012 was a positive and pivotal year marking real progress in our 
journey to transform the business, whilst maintaining our focus on excellence 
in operations, and disciplined capital project execution across our generation 
and retail businesses.

Strategy
Our vision for Drax is to be a bold, customer 
oriented power generation and retail business, 
driven by biomass innovation. We have two 
key strategic initiatives to enable us to achieve 
our vision, namely, our project to convert 
Drax Power Station into a predominantly  
biomass-fuelled generating asset and our 
programme for the expansion of our retail 
business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”) 
through growing our sales to businesses.
Commodity markets
The gas market continued to be the dominant 
factor in driving power prices. The impact of 
the incident at one of Japan’s nuclear power 
stations continued to be felt through the 
country’s increased demand for liqueﬁed natural 
gas (“LNG”) and consequent increasing Asian 
LNG prices. As a result the UK saw reduced 
LNG imports and gas prices remained strong. 
Accordingly, some gas-ﬁred plant capacity was 
withdrawn from the market and in some cases 
considered for closure.
International coal prices were weak as a result 
of excess supply. Exports from the US to Europe, 
in particular, increased signiﬁcantly. A combination 
of low prices and high stocks put pressure on the 
UK’s domestic coal producers.
Carbon prices remained at their lowest point for 
over three years driven by over-supply of carbon 
emissions allowances in Phase II of the EU Emissions 
Trading System (“EU ETS”). As of 1 January 2013, 
we entered into Phase III of the EU ETS, which 
introduced 100% auctioning of allowances to 
the power sector – a departure from receiving 
allowances in the previous Phases. 
With Phase II surplus bankable in Phase III 
a range of interventions is being considered 
by the European Commission to rectify the  
over-supply, but these are by no means certain 
to proceed. 
Dark green spreads, the difference between the 
price of power and the cost of coal and carbon, 
have been relatively good for coal-ﬁred generators. 
The introduction to the UK of the carbon price 
support mechanism from April 2013 is likely 
to erode the competitive position in the 
market of our coal-ﬁred generation business, 
but at the same time it strengthens the case 
for biomass generation.
During 2012, bark spreads for co-ﬁring, the 
difference between power price and renewable 
support and the cost of biomass, remained weak 
with most traded biomass commanding lower 
margins than coal. Consequently, the amount of 
commercial biomass burnt during the year was 
much lower than previous years. Substantially 
all of the biomass burnt during the period was 
at a loss, but in support of critical research and 
development work.
The Government’s new support levels for biomass 
electricity through conversion and co-ﬁring come 
into effect in April 2013. We expect co-ﬁring 
at low levels to remain uneconomic, but generation 
through converted units will become economic 
and yield attractive rates of return on the required 
capital investment. 
Over the following pages we highlight 
some of the progress we’re making 
across our key priorities…

Retail performance
During 2012 our retail business, Haven Power, 
delivered substantial growth in a highly competitive 
market with retail sales over 60% higher than in 
2011. Sales growth remains a key priority for the 
business, targeting the industrial and commercial 
(“I&C”), and small and medium enterprise (“SME”) 
markets. Due to our continued drive for growth 
across these markets we expect Haven Power to 
make a modest loss up to 2015.
An excellent standard of customer service 
is central to our proposition for this business, 
and we were pleased to see recognition of 
that through being ranked No. 1 for customer 
satisfaction in the SME market in the 2012 
Datamonitor Survey.
Selling our output through Haven Power continues 
to provide us with a credit-efﬁcient route to market 
for our power sales compared to the wholesale 
electricity market, as well as a route to market for 
the Renewables Obligation Certiﬁcates and Levy 
Exemption Certiﬁcates associated with our 
renewable power generation. 
Generation performance 
We continued to deliver industry-leading performance 
in 2012 amid higher than ever output levels, and 
signiﬁcant project and construction activity. 
As in previous years, our load factor was high 
compared to other thermal capacity on the system 
and we recorded our highest ever generation 
out-turn level. With high availability and reliability 
throughout 2012 we were able to continue to deliver 
additional value to the business through providing 
ﬂexible generation output and balancing services 
to the System Operator, National Grid, in support 
of system stability and security.
Two planned unit outages were undertaken during 
2012, and both were completed in good time. 
With two outages and considerable biomass 
project work activity, the number of engineering 
man-hours worked throughout the year was 
signiﬁcant. Yet against this backdrop our safety 
statistics continued to be industry-leading, 
reﬂecting the emphasis we place on safety. 
For the year, our forced outage rate, which measures 
any reduction in plant availability excluding planned 
outages, was close to our long-term target of 5%, 
which has been set through extensive benchmarking 
with UK and international coal-ﬁred plants to 
determine the optimum balance between 
performance and cost. 
We continued to work on increasing our burn of 
fuels which have a higher margin or lower carbon 
footprint over the standard bituminous coal which 
we burn. These advantaged fuels – petcoke, pond 
ﬁnes and commercial or economic biomass – 
accounted for 7% of the total fuel burnt during 
the year. 
Assessment of the technical solutions available 
to us for compliance with the more stringent 
emissions standards of the Industrial Emissions 
Directive from 2016 is well advanced. The key 
factors in determining the optimal solution for 
compliance are plant ﬂexibility and fuel mix. 
Hence, the level of biomass burn is an important 
consideration. The legislative arrangements in place 
afford us some ﬂexibility in the timing and the extent 
of the required modiﬁcations which ﬁts well with our 
biomass conversion programme.
Biomass transformation
During the year we completed our engineering 
designs of the plant modiﬁcations and new facilities 
required for unit conversion. We made good 
progress on the time critical construction of the 
receipt, storage and delivery systems for biomass, 
including the erection of the ﬁrst two biomass 
storage domes. Building on the early work 
undertaken in 2012 and making use of the existing 
biomass co-ﬁring infrastructure we believe it will be 
technically feasible to convert single units in 2013, 
2014 and 2015. However, the actual timing is 
dependent on biomass fuel sourcing. 
We have made good progress towards securing 
sufﬁcient biomass to run two converted units and 
we plan to convert the ﬁrst unit in April 2013 and 
the second unit in 2014. We are now in advanced 
negotiations for a large proportion of the biomass 
necessary to fuel the third unit. Established North 
American suppliers, Enviva, Green Circle, Pinnacle 
and Plum Creek are amongst those with whom 
we have entered into term contracts for the supply 
of wood pellets and sustainable forest ﬁbre.

Chief Executive’s statement
Elsewhere in the supply chain, at the end of 2012 
the ﬁnal investment decision was taken to develop 
two US-based pellet plants, one in each of the 
states of Mississippi and Louisiana, with a combined 
capacity of 900,000 tonnes a year, and to invest in 
a port facility in Louisiana with an export capacity 
of 3 million tonnes a year. We are now ﬁnalising the 
construction arrangements for these facilities.
In addition, terms have been agreed with UK 
port operators to provide us with biomass import 
facilities. This will involve the development of 
new facilities and the expansion of existing ones. 
Finally, the fabrication of bespoke rail wagons 
to transport biomass from the ports to the power 
station is underway.
Biomass sustainability 
All our biomass is procured against our own robust 
sustainability criteria, which include greenhouse gas 
emission reduction requirements, and habitats and 
biodiversity protection, as well as socio-economic 
considerations in the source areas. A programme of 
independent audits ensures all our suppliers comply 
with our sustainability criteria. 
We ﬁrmly believe that robust, mandatory 
sustainability criteria are vital to maintain and 
enhance public acceptance, and ensure that 
sustainable practices are implemented. Assessment 
of the full life cycle carbon footprint of biomass, 
that is, from ﬁeld or forest-to-furnace, is now well 
developed, especially in the UK where a mandatory 
life cycle standard is scheduled to come into effect 
later this year. 
With a number of years’ experience of calculating 
the life cycle carbon footprint of all the biomass 
we procure, we are conﬁdent that our sustainable 
biomass fuel sources will meet the UK’s new 
mandatory standard which will ensure we continue 
to earn regulatory support. 
Our calculations show that the range of sustainable 
biomass materials we have burnt over the last few 
years has a far lower carbon footprint than that of 
fossil fuel-ﬁred generating plant. In 2012, the average 
greenhouse gas saving, over the full life cycle, 
resulting from burning sustainable biomass in place 
of coal was above 80%. 
Pioneering the conversion 
of existing generating units
Development of the necessary infrastructure 
at Drax Power Station is well advanced, from 
a new rail unloading facility, through storage 
domes and delivery system to the modiﬁed 
boilers. In terms of the sheer scale and 
quality, the transformation is unparalleled.
Increasing capacity 
of US port handling
In support of our US-based pellet plant 
operations and wood pellet supply 
contracts, the decision has been taken 
to invest in a US port facility, in the state 
of Louisiana.
UK handling and  
transportation
Agreements are in place for the expansion 
of UK port throughput capability to support 
our imports of sustainable biomass pellets. 
Bespoke rail wagons have been designed 
and are being fabricated to transport the 
pellets from the ports to the power station.
Securing supplies of 
sustainable biomass
Further progress has been made in securing 
rights for the supply of sustainable biomass. 
Additionally, at the end of 2012 the decision 
was taken to invest upstream through the 
development of US-based pellet plants.

our high and low pressure turbines, which is 
delivering an overall efﬁciency improvement 
and a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide. 
The three generating units being converted to 
biomass will also beneﬁt from investment in 
upgrading the intermediate pressure turbines, 
which is due to commence in 2014. 
One of our key priorities…

Further carbon abatement 
In addition to the carbon dioxide (“CO2”) savings 
through burning sustainable biomass in place of 
coal, we have also progressed other carbon 
abatement activities. 
The low pressure and high pressure turbine modules 
of all six generating units have now been replaced 
and are operating as expected. This means we are 
operating at an overall, coal-based efﬁciency for 
the power station of around 40%, and through this 
upgrade alone we are reducing our CO2 emissions 
by 1 million tonnes a year. 
We have also taken the decision to upgrade the 
intermediate pressure turbines of the three 
generating units that will be converted to biomass. 
The ﬁrst will be undertaken during 2014. This will 
deliver further efﬁciency improvement beneﬁts. 
Siemens will again be responsible for the 
manufacture and assembly of the turbines from 
its facility in Mülheim with installation support 
from Siemens in Newcastle.
Together Drax, Alstom UK and BOC (a member 
of The Linde Group) have formed a consortium 
in support of the White Rose Carbon Capture 
and Storage (“CCS”) Project, a proposed 426MW 
oxyfuel CCS demonstration project based at the 
Drax Power Station site. At the beginning of July 
2012 the consortium, in conjunction with National 
Grid Carbon Limited, submitted a bidder proposal 
for funds through the UK CCS Commercialisation 
Programme, which was launched in April 2012.
At the end of October 2012, the White Rose CCS 
Project was one of four shortlisted for the next 
phase of the UK competition. The consortium is 
fully engaged in the process, but the project will be 
dependent on successful outcomes from external 
funding processes and Electricity Market Reform 
mechanisms to incentivise low carbon technologies. 
Legislative framework
In November 2012, the Energy Bill was introduced 
to Parliament marking the start of its passage 
through both the House of Commons and the 
House of Lords. At the heart of the Bill is Electricity 
Market Reform, which will see, amongst other things, 
the introduction of Contracts for Difference (“CfD”)
providing long-term contracts and a stable revenue 
stream enabling investment in low carbon generating 
technologies, and a capacity market to mitigate 
future risks to the security of electricity supplies.
CfD will replace the Renewables Obligation in 2017 
for new renewable generation facilities, but not 
those already in operation. We are exploring the CfD 
mechanism for biomass and have participated in a 
call for evidence, launched by National Grid as part 
of its potential role as delivery body, to support the 
development of strike prices under the mechanism. 
We have also had preliminary discussions with the 
Department of Energy & Climate Change on the 
possibility of securing long-term contracts to enable 
early investment in advance of the CfD mechanism 
coming into force.
Looking ahead
We enter 2013 with a strong hedge from forward 
power sales, but with no national carbon emissions 
allocation under Phase III of the EU ETS and, from 
April, increased carbon costs under the UK carbon 
price support mechanism. Both of these changes 
are recognised in current stock market forecasts.
We intend to continue our hard work to deliver 
leading operating and cost performance and to 
retain our focus on building options to burn 
advantaged fuels.
With a commitment to deliver value to our 
shareholders, we are now in full execution mode to 
transform Drax into a predominantly biomass-fuelled 
generator. In doing so we are conﬁdent that we will 
not only secure an attractive future for the business 
and our shareholders, but also deliver a signiﬁcant 
amount of cost-effective renewable power for the 
consumer and make a meaningful contribution to 
the UK’s 2020 climate change targets.

Principal performance indicators
Monitoring our performance…
Our principal performance indicators provide a snapshot of how we are performing 
against our overriding objective to maximise shareholder value, and the progress 
we are making against our strategic initiatives and key priorities.
Deliver our  
biomass strategy
Maximise the value of the Drax business
Tonnes of sustainable biomass fuel burnt 
during the year
Why we measure
Measuring the levels of sustainable biomass 
burnt tracks our progress in producing power 
from renewable and sustainable sources.
Comment
Very little commercial biomass was burnt 
during the year, as the margins remain weak 
at current support levels. However we did 
undertake further R&D trials in 2012.
CO2 emissions rate per unit of output
Why we measure
This measure of carbon emissions illustrates 
our progress in reducing the carbon footprint 
of Drax Power Station.
Comment
Savings were made in 2011 and 2012 from 
the turbine upgrade project and from burning 
sustainable biomass, the total volume of which 
was higher in 2011.
The aggregate of net merchant sales 
and net Balancing Mechanism activity
Why we measure
Net sales tracks the volume of power we can 
sell at positive margins.
Comment
Our high availability and superior efﬁciency 
in comparison to other coal-ﬁred generators 
allowed us to take advantage of good margins 
available, driving the increase in net power sold.
Power revenues divided by volume of 
net sales (includes imbalance charges)
Why we measure
The average achieved price of electricity tracks 
the power price component of the dark green 
spread achieved.
Comment
Our average achieved price of electricity reﬂects 
the contracted position at the start of the year, 
as well as power prices during the period. 
2011 beneﬁted from earlier forward power 
sales captured at enhanced prices reﬂecting 
the impact of world events on market prices 
for power.
Fuel costs excluding carbon divided by 
volume of net sales
Why we measure
The average cost of fuel excluding carbon tracks 
the fuel cost component of the dark green and 
bark spread achieved, and reﬂects the value 
captured from effective fuel procurement and 
diversiﬁed fuel sources.
Comment
Falling coal prices and lower volumes of biomass 
burn combined to decrease our average cost 
of fuel in 2012. Average fuel costs for 2012 are 
calculated net of fuel sales of £17 million.
Carbon costs divided by volume of 
allowances purchased
Why we measure
The average cost of carbon tracks the 
carbon cost component of the dark green 
spread achieved.
Comment
A large proportion of our 2012 carbon 
contracts were locked in during 2011, when 
we sold the related power. Carbon prices 
fell signiﬁcantly in the second half of 2011, 
reducing our average cost.

Net sales distributed through our retail 
supply arm, Haven Power
Why we measure
A measure of the rate of growth in our 
retail business.
Comment
Our retail business, Haven Power, continued to 
deliver good growth during 2012, largely as a 
result of the planned expansion of the industrial 
and commercial customer base.
Includes cash and short-term investments, 
less borrowings net of deferred ﬁnance costs
Why we measure
Monitoring net cash ensures an efﬁcient capital 
structure is maintained to support our business, 
alongside sufﬁcient liquidity to manage our 
future obligations.
Comment
Share placing funds raised and higher capital 
expenditure were offset to give an overall 
increase in our net cash position at the end 
of the year.
Average percentage of time the units were 
available for generation
Why we measure
Availability tracks our operating performance, 
enabling assessment of, and providing guidance 
for, our operational regime and maintenance 
investment plans.
Comment
The 2012 plant availability continues to 
demonstrate our leadership position in the 
coal-ﬁred generation sector, with the impact 
of a double planned outage marginally lowering 
availability in comparison to 2011 levels.
Net sent out generation as a percentage 
of total available generation capacity
Why we measure
Load factor tracks our operating performance 
and the competitiveness of Drax Power Station.
Comment
An increase in generation output (net sales) 
in 2012 resulted in a higher load factor, 
and highlights our competitive position 
in the marketplace.
The frequency rate is calculated on 
the following basis: lost time injuries/
hours worked x 100,000
Why we measure
These injury rate metrics track our health and safety performance and enable us to maintain a 
positive health and safety culture.
Comment
Our safety record continues to be industry-leading and was delivered alongside a signiﬁcant amount 
of project activity and a double planned outage during 2012.
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: (lost time injuries + worse than

Marketplace
Where we sell our power…
The structure of the electricity market
The electricity market in Great Britain (“GB”) is 
characterised by six large vertically integrated 
companies and a number of smaller “independent” 
companies. Drax is an independent company, 
which until 2009 was solely focused on the 
generation of electricity.
Today, the energy mix beneﬁts from a diversity 
of fuel sources, including gas, coal, nuclear and 
renewables, which is a key contributor to security 
of supply.
In 2011 (the latest ﬁgures available(1)), the generating 
capacity of the UK’s major power producers was 
81,750MW. The ﬁnal consumption of electricity in 
2011 was approximately 318TWh.
The six large vertically integrated players have 
control, either through ownership or long-term 
contracts, of some 65% of the total generation 
capacity and have a combined interest of over 
93%(2) in the supply market, with nearly all of the 
domestic gas and electricity accounts.
Drax has a 5% share in the generation capacity 
market and typically meets 7% of the UK’s electricity 
needs. Through our retail company, Haven Power, 
we serve businesses of all sizes, together accounting 
for sales of over 5TWh of power in 2012. 
The wholesale electricity market 
Various mechanisms exist to allow power to be 
traded at the wholesale level in GB. Trading can take 
place via forward and futures markets and power 
exchanges, and through brokers and bilaterally. 
Power can be traded close to real-time and up to 
several years ahead of delivery. It can also be traded 
for speciﬁc periods, for example, speciﬁc half hours 
or speciﬁc seasons. The GB wholesale electricity 
market trades across three sub-markets:
 
k long-term forward and futures market 
allowing contracts to be struck up to several 
years ahead of delivery in response to market 
participants’ requirements;
 
k short-term bilateral market operated through 
power exchanges which gives market participants 
the opportunity to ﬁne tune their contractual 
positions; and
 
k Balancing Mechanism (real-time market) through 
which the System Operator accepts offers and 
bids for electricity to enable it to balance supply 
and demand on the system.
From a nationalised, centrally planned system, the UK electricity sector has 
been transformed since the beginning of its privatisation in 1990. Privatisation, 
liberalisation and energy policy have shaped the market and driven increasing 
consolidation and market reform. Complex arrangements and mechanisms 
have evolved to match the supply and demand of a product which is not stored, 
yet is vital to everyday life.
Our role in the electricity supply chain
Our interests in the electricity supply chain cover the generation, 
wholesale and retail markets.

Wholesale prices
Power prices are driven by a number of factors, 
such as underlying commodity prices, the availability 
of generating capacity on the electricity system, 
and the physical positions taken by individual 
market participants.
The wholesale market operates on price and the 
relative prices of gas and coal, along with the 
operating efﬁciencies of the various power stations, 
will determine which of gas-ﬁred generation or 
coal-ﬁred generation is the more expensive and so 
operates at the margin. If gas prices are high then 
gas-ﬁred generation becomes the marginal plant. 
With a coal-based operating efﬁciency of around 
40%, Drax Power Station is at the top of the 
so-called merit order for UK coal-ﬁred generation. 
So, we will be the ﬁrst of the coal-ﬁred plants to 
be called on to generate even when coal-ﬁred 
generation is at the margin. 
Commodity markets 
The trends in commodity prices witnessed in 2011 
and 2012 are described further in the following 
paragraphs and are illustrated in the accompanying 
charts overleaf.
Gas 
After a signiﬁcant step up in prices following the 
Fukushima disaster in 2011, continued restrictions 
on nuclear generation kept upward pressure on the 
global liqueﬁed natural gas (“LNG”) market during 
2012. The resulting rise in Asian LNG prices limited 
the attractiveness of the UK spot market, leading 
to falling imports of LNG.
UK spot gas prices remained strong throughout 2012. 
With the ongoing decline in production from the 
UK Continental Shelf, UK gas prices continue to be 
pulled upwards towards oil indexed European prices 
(and international LNG prices) to attract imports. 
European and UK gas prices remain at a premium to 
US prices, where advances in technology are leading 
to a large supply of low priced shale gas, adding to 
already signiﬁcant reserves which may enable the 
US to become self-sufﬁcient. However, shale gas 
developments outside the US are in their infancy 
and will, therefore, have little impact in the short to 
medium term. Furthermore, demand for gas is rising 
rapidly so that even with the possibility of increased 
shale gas production, global markets may well 
remain strong.
Power 
Power prices continue to be driven by the gas 
market. With a peak in the ﬁrst half of 2011 following 
the Japanese earthquake, prices fell back on mild 
weather towards the end of the year but recovered 
early in 2012 and remained relatively stable 
throughout the second half of the year.

Marketplace
Coal 
Asian demand, particularly from China, pushed 
global steam coal market prices to a peak in 
mid-2011. Since that point, coal prices have steadily 
fallen. The low US gas prices described above have 
forced a dramatic increase in US coal exports. 
Combined with a rise in Colombian and Australian 
shipments to Europe, this has resulted in a weak 
global short-term market characterised by low 
international prices and high stocks in Europe. 
Although Asian demand has continued to grow, it 
has been insufﬁcient to absorb the excess supply.
These market dynamics, as well as increasing 
operating costs, have increased the pressure 
on UK domestic coal producers.
Carbon 
Carbon prices also rose in the immediate aftermath 
of the Japanese earthquake, but then dropped 
sharply in the second half of 2011 amid fears for 
the Eurozone economies. 
This trend continued throughout 2012, with 
prices falling to record lows around the end of 
the year. With any Phase II surplus bankable into 
Phase III, pricing has been driven by political and 
macroeconomic factors. The increasing renewable 
generation build rate and the slow pace of economic 
recovery have led to a large over-supply of carbon 
allowances in Phase III. The EU is considering a range 
of options to remedy this over-supply, but these are 
by no means certain to proceed. 
Dark green spread 
The combination of stable power prices and lower 
coal and carbon prices drove an improvement in 
dark green spreads during 2012.
Biomass
Types of biomass
Biomass used in energy production comes in many 
different forms, but the important characteristics 
shared by the wide range of biomass fuels are that 
they are renewable and can be sustainable.
The three most common types of biomass used 
to generate electricity are forestry products 
and residues, agricultural residues, and energy 
crops. Recovered materials offer another, 
very useful, source.
Forestry products and residues 
Sustainably produced woody biomass can be 
produced from managed forests and forestry 
residues, such as thinnings, tree tops and branches. 
The economics of forest management usually mean 
that energy is well down the list of potential uses for 
wood. Timber, the most valuable part of a tree, is 
generally used for furniture and building materials, 
while smaller diameter wood can be used for fence 
posts or by the paper and wood panel industries. 
This leaves the lower value thinnings and branches 
for energy production as they often have no other 
commercial use. In some geographic regions, decline 
of industries such as construction and paper and 
pulp means that energy producers may be able 
to afford ﬁbre previously supplied to these, currently 
declining, markets. This is welcomed by the forest 
owners who need to harvest mature trees and 
thereby maintain investment in sustainable 
forest management.

Agricultural residues 
The by-products of food production, such as straw, 
oat husks, peanut husks, grape ﬂour, cocoa shells, 
olive cake and many more, can all be used as biomass 
for energy production. Importantly, because they are 
by-products of food production they do not reduce 
the amount of land available for farming, and they 
are readily available. Residues from non-food crops, 
such as cork ﬁnes, can also be used. By placing a 
value on what may be an unwanted by-product of 
farming, the use of biomass to produce energy 
provides a new income stream for farmers.
Energy crops 
These are crops that are planted speciﬁcally for the 
purpose of producing energy. Energy crops include 
short rotation coppice willow and miscanthus, 
commonly known as elephant grass. Since the start 
of the UK’s Energy Crop Scheme in 2000, thousands 
of hectares of miscanthus and other short rotation 
coppice crops have been planted in the UK alone.
Recovered materials 
Recovered wood is an example of a material that 
could be used as a biomass fuel. The construction 
and demolition sectors are very large producers of 
recoverable wood. 
Availability of biomass
Biomass is a diverse, readily available and 
plentiful fuel source. According to the International 
Energy Agency, biomass is the fourth largest 
energy resource in the world after oil, coal and gas. 
It estimates that by 2050, sustainable sources of 
biomass could be enough to supply the world with 
10%–20% of its primary energy requirements.
The EU has indicated that the use of biomass will 
double over the next few years, and be responsible 
for around a half of the total effort in reaching the 
EU’s 20% renewable energy target by 2020. In the 
UK, the Government’s 2012 update to the Renewable 
Energy Roadmap reports on analysis which indicates 
that by 2020 as much as 11% of the UK’s total 
primary energy demand (across heat, transport 
and electricity) could come from bioenergy.
Biomass procurement
Our biomass is procured against our robust 
sustainability policy which is independently audited. 
We are in our ﬁfth year of monitoring the carbon 
footprint of all the biomass we burn. More on our 
sustainability policy can be found in Corporate 
and social responsibility.

Operational and ﬁnancial performance
Strength across our operations…
Introduction
Our 2012 proﬁt reﬂects continued strength in our operations. We also delivered 
another year of industry-leading safety statistics, against a backdrop of 
signiﬁcant project activity at the Drax site, including a planned double outage and 
commencement of construction on our new biomass storage and handling facilities.
EBITDA was £298 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 compared to 
£334 million in 2011 and underlying basic earnings per share were 52 pence 
compared to 56 pence last year. 
A year-on-year increase in gross margin reﬂects a record level of generation 
at the power station. This was offset at EBITDA level by higher operating costs 
of the planned double outage and costs we incurred, following the Government’s 
conﬁrmation of regulatory support for biomass, as we accelerated our plans 
to put ourselves in the best possible position to convert a ﬁrst unit to biomass 
in April 2013. 
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”) continued to deliver 
good growth during 2012. Sales increased from 3.3TWh in 2011 to 5.1TWh in 2012, 
largely as a result of the planned growth of the industrial and commercial 
customer base.
Towards the end of the year we secured the ﬁnancing required to support our 
biomass transformation plans, with the successful completion of a share placing, 
agreement of new term loan facilities, and the reﬁnancing of our working capital 
and letter of credit facilities. With net cash of £311 million at the year end, we have 
in place a strong ﬁnancial platform from which to realise our ambitions. 
At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board will recommend a ﬁnal dividend

Generation results
Revenue 
Total generation revenue for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was £1,630 million compared 
to £1,735 million in 2011. Total generation revenue 
in 2012 includes power sales of £1,527 million 
(2011: £1,641 million), ROC and LEC sales of 
£63 million (2011: £69 million), ancillary services 
income of £15 million (2011: £17 million) and other 
income of £26 million (2011: £8 million).
Net power sold increased to 27.1TWh in 2012, 
compared to 26.4TWh in 2011, but at a lower average 
achieved electricity price of £51.3 per MWh compared 
to £55.6 per MWh in 2011, resulting in the overall 
reduction in revenue from power sales in the year. 
Our average achieved price of electricity reﬂects the 
contracted position at the start of the year, as well as 
power prices during the period. 2011 beneﬁted from 
earlier forward sales captured at enhanced prices, 
as well as higher power prices in the year, with prices 
peaking in the ﬁrst half following the Japanese 
earthquake (see Commodity markets). 
Margins available to coal-ﬁred generators improved 
in 2012, largely as a result of lower international 
coal and carbon prices. Our high availability and 
superior efﬁciency in comparison to other coal-ﬁred 
generators has allowed us to take advantage of 
the good margins available, driving the increase 
in net power sold.
Revenue from the sale of ROCs and LECs is a 
function of both the movement in ROC and LEC 
assets in the balance sheet, and the volume of 
biomass burnt in the period. ROC and LEC assets 
held in the balance sheet fell from £32 million at 
the end of 2011 to £19 million at 31 December 2012. 
B
This was offset by lower levels of biomass burn in 
2012 (see Fuel costs). As a result ROC and LEC sales 
were £63 million in 2012 compared to £69 million in 
2011 (including sales to Haven Power). 
We changed our accounting policy for ROCs in 2012 
so that they now match the value generated to the 
period in which biomass is burnt rather than the 
period in which ROCs are sold. However, with support 
for biomass at only 0.5ROC/MWh until April 2013, 
the change in policy had negligible impact on our 
ﬁnancial results in this annual report and accounts. 
Ancillary services income decreased slightly 
from £17 million to £15 million. This revenue arises 
from the services we provide to National Grid to 
balance system supply and demand. As a ﬂexible 
generator, Drax continues to play a signiﬁcant role 
in supporting the balancing of the system.
Other income of £26 million in 2012 includes 
£9 million for the sale of by-products (2011: £8 million) 
and £17 million for fuel sales. During 2012 certain 
coal inventories (at port) were sold to a third party 
for stock management purposes. 
Fuel costs 
(coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels)
Fuel costs were £929 million in 2012, compared to 
£1,021 million in 2011. 
We burnt approximately 9.6 million tonnes of coal 
in the year ended 31 December 2012, compared 
to approximately 9.1 million tonnes in 2011 reﬂecting 
higher generation and lower biomass burn. 
This coal was purchased from a variety of domestic 
and international sources under either ﬁxed or 
variable priced contracts with different maturities. 
Coal represented around 90% of total fuel burnt 
(by heat content) in 2012 and 87% in 2011.

Drax Group plc
Annual report and 
accounts 2012
We also burnt 0.1 million tonnes of petcoke and 
0.6 million tonnes of pond ﬁnes in both years. 
Our petcoke burn volume is driven by its pricing 
relative to coal. Pond ﬁnes is a coal mining residue, 
which trades at a signiﬁcant discount to coal, and 
requires speciﬁc blending and handling techniques 
to burn in large volumes. 
In 2012, we burnt 0.7 million tonnes of biomass 
(2011: 1.3 million tonnes) representing 5% of total 
fuel burnt by heat content (2011: 9%). The majority 
of the biomass we burnt in 2012 related to our 
research and development (“R&D”) trial work. 
Very little commercial biomass was burnt during 
the year, as the margins remain weak at current 
support levels. 
The average cost of fuel per MWh (excluding CO2 
emissions allowances) was £30.6 for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 (net of £17 million fuel 
sales described above), compared to £33.3 in 2011. 
The decrease in average fuel prices was driven by 
the falling price of international coal (see Commodity 
markets) and the fuel mix, with much lower biomass 
burn in 2012. 
Fuel costs (CO2 emissions allowances)
For Phase II of the EU ETS (2008–2012), Drax had 
an allocation of 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions 
allowances per annum under the UK NAP. We 
purchase CO2 emissions allowances under ﬁxed 
price contracts with different maturity dates from 
a variety of domestic and international sources.
Our CO2 emissions allowances requirement for 
the year ended 31 December 2012, in excess of 
those allocated under the UK NAP, was 
approximately 13.1 million tonnes compared to 
approximately 11.6 million tonnes in 2011. This was 
a result of higher generation and the change in 
fuel mix described above. 
Our average price of carbon is a function of the 
timing of purchases under ﬁxed price contracts 
in the forward and near-term markets. The average 
price expensed for purchased CO2 emissions 
allowances during the year ended 31 December 2012 
was £6.3 per tonne compared to £12.0 per tonne 
in 2011. This reﬂects the signiﬁcant fall in carbon 
prices since mid-2011 (see Commodity markets).
Cost of power purchases
We purchase power in the market when the cost 
of power in the market is below our marginal 
cost of production in respect of power previously 
contracted for generation and delivery by us, and 
to cover any shortfall in generation. For the year ended 
31 December 2012, the cost of purchased power for the 
generation business was £138 million, compared to 
£172 million incurred in 2011, reﬂecting lower average 
power prices in 2012 (see Commodity markets). 
Grid charges
Grid charges for generation for the year ended 
31 December 2012 were £66 million, compared 
to £58 million in 2011. The increase resulted from 
higher generation and an increase in the rate 
charged by National Grid to reﬂect the impact of 
increased intermittent generation on system 
balancing costs. 
Higher net power sold and improved dark green 
spreads resulted in generation gross proﬁt for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 of £496 million 
compared to £484 million in 2011. 
Operating and administrative expenses 
Generation other operating and administrative 
expenses before depreciation and amortisation were 
£193 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, 
compared to £148 million in 2011, an increase of 
£45 million.

Most of this increase (£38 million) was captured in 
our operating cost guidance set out at the beginning 
of 2012. This included £20 million as a direct result 
of the planned double outage in 2012 (single outage 
in 2011), together with a structural uplift in business 
rates charges. Investment in growth, including the 
completion of our biomass R&D work, added a 
further £10 million, and cost inﬂation of £8 million 
(5%) followed three successive years holding 
underlying costs level.
Following the Government’s conﬁrmation of the 
regulatory support for biomass in the second half of 
the year, we accelerated our plans to put ourselves 
in the best possible position to convert the ﬁrst unit 
to biomass in April 2013. We incurred additional 
preventative maintenance, system and other costs 
of around £7 million in 2012 to execute these plans.
We remain focused on achieving strong operational 
cost performance and we will continue to carefully 
control our cost base.
As a result of the double planned outage and 
the acceleration of our biomass transformation 
plans, generation EBITDA for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was £303 million compared 
to £336 million in 2011. 
Retail results
Revenue 
Retail sales volumes increased from 3.3TWh in the 
year ended 31 December 2011 to 5.1TWh in 2012. This 
reﬂects planned growth in Haven Power’s industrial 
and commercial customer base and increased sales 
to the small and medium size enterprise market. 
As a result, retail revenue was £451 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2012, compared to 
£276 million in 2011. 
E
This is in line with our strategy to target a 10–15TWh 
business at Haven Power, with retail sales being a 
credit-efﬁcient alternative to selling power in the 
wholesale market. Whilst the markets in which Haven 
Power operates remain highly competitive, we have 
been successful in securing growth through good 
customer service, and our bad debt experience 
remains low.
Cost of power purchases
Retail cost of power purchases were £279 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 compared to 
£171 million in 2011. Haven Power purchases power 
for delivery to its retail customers. The vast majority 
of these purchases are from Drax Power Limited 
and are eliminated on a group basis. The increase 
in Haven Power’s cost of power purchases is a result 
of the signiﬁcant increase in sales volumes. 
Grid charges
Haven Power incurred £102 million of grid charges 
during the year ended 31 December 2012 and 
£60 million during the year ended 31 December 2011. 
Charges have increased as a result of higher sales 
volumes together with substantial increases in the rates 
charged by the network operators and National Grid. 
Other retail costs
Other retail costs which include broker fees, ROCs, 
LECs, Feed-in-Tariff levelisation and metering were 
£56 million in the year ended 31 December 2012, 
compared to £29 million in 2011. In addition to the 
effect of higher volumes, costs have increased in 
2012 due to large increases in the Renewables 
Obligation and the Feed-in-Tariff levelisation costs 
resulting from the continued high uptake of solar 
photovoltaic subsidies. 
Retail gross proﬁt for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was £15 million compared 
to £16 million in 2011.

Operating and administrative expenses
Retail operating and administrative expenses 
excluding depreciation and amortisation were 
£19 million for the year ended 31 December 2012, 
consistent with 2011. Higher staff costs to support 
the continued growth in the business have been 
offset by a reduction in other operating and 
administrative expenses.
Retail EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 
2012 was a loss of £5 million compared to a loss 
of £3 million in 2011. 
Central costs
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation was £59 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2012 and £57 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2011. 
Unrealised gains and losses 
on derivative contracts
The Group recognises unrealised gains and losses 
on forward contracts which meet the deﬁnition of 
derivatives under IFRSs. Where possible, we take the 
own use exemption for derivative contracts entered 
into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage 
requirements, including forward domestic coal and 
biomass contracts. 
As such, the movement in the net unrealised gains 
and losses recognised in the balance sheet relates 
to the mark-to-market of our forward contracts for 
power yet to be delivered, as well as the mark-to-
market on other commodities and foreign exchange 
contracts. The following table shows the movements 
in unrealised gains and losses and where they are 
recorded in our ﬁnancial statements.

Mark-to-market movements on most of our 
derivative contracts, considered to be effective 
hedges, have been recognised through the hedge 
reserve, a component of shareholders’ equity in the 
balance sheet. Movements in unrealised gains and 
losses recognised in the hedge reserve are mainly 
the result of unwinding mark-to-market positions 
relating to power delivered during a reporting 
period, and the recording of mark-to-market 
positions on power yet to be delivered at the end 
of that period. 
The average price of power that had been 
contracted but had yet to be delivered at 
31 December 2011 was higher than market prices, 
driving an unrealised gain. Offsetting this was 
an unrealised loss on coal and carbon contracts, 
resulting in a net unrealised gain in the balance 
sheet of £31 million at 31 December 2011. 
The fair value losses of £106 million recognised in 
the hedge reserve in 2012 reﬂect the unwinding 
of the 2011 year end position as the power was 
delivered. Relatively stable power prices through 
most of 2012, resulted in the average contracted 
power price ending the year at a similar level to 
market prices.
The unrealised losses recognised in the income 
statement of £36 million for the year ended 
31 December 2012 and unrealised gains of 
£90 million in 2011 arise from mark-to-market 
movements on our derivative contracts which 
do not qualify for hedge accounting; largely 
ﬁnancial coal and foreign exchange.
As we look to secure an increasing number of 
international contracts for the supply of biomass to 
support our strategy for renewable generation, we 
have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts 
to limit our exposure to ﬂuctuations in exchange 
rates. A weakening US dollar at the end of 2012 
resulted in unrealised losses recognised through 
the income statement and in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2012 in respect of these contracts.
This combination of factors resulted in the 
recognition of an unrealised loss of £110 million 
in the balance sheet at 31 December 2012.
In considering mark-to-market movements, it is 
important to recognise that proﬁtability is driven 
by our strategy to deliver market level dark green 
or bark spreads, not by the absolute price of any 
single commodity at any given date.
After allowing for the unrealised gains and 
losses on derivative contracts, depreciation and 
amortisation, operating proﬁt for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was £204 million compared 
to £366 million in 2011.

Interest 
Net ﬁnance costs for the year ended 31 December 
2012 were £14 million compared with £28 million 
in 2011. 
Finance costs for 2011 include interest and other 
charges associated with the balance of a term loan 
of £135 million which was repaid in full in July 2011, 
resulting in lower costs for 2012. However, ﬁnance 
costs for 2012 did include £6 million in respect of 
the reﬁnancing completed in December. 
Tax 
The tax charge before exceptional items was 
£26 million (an effective rate of 14%), compared 
to £71 million in 2011 (an effective rate of 21%). 
2012 includes the impact of a revision to previous 
years’ capital allowances claims now agreed with 
HMRC, resulting in a tax credit of £8 million recognised 
in the period.
The tax charge includes the impact of a 2% reduction 
in corporation tax rate for both years on current and 
deferred taxes, resulting in a £15 million tax credit in 
2012 (2011: £16 million). The effective tax rate before 
exceptional items and the impact of changes in the 
corporation tax rate was 22% in 2012 (2011: 26%).
The exceptional tax credit of £198 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2011 reﬂects the agreement 
reached with HMRC over the Eurobond tax position 
and a number of other legacy issues. 
As a result of the above factors, proﬁt attributable 
to equity shareholders for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was £164 million compared 
to £465 million in 2011, and basic and diluted 
earnings per share were 44 pence compared to 
127 pence and 126 pence, respectively, in 2011. 
Underlying proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders 
(that is proﬁt excluding the after tax impact of 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, 
and exceptional items) was £193 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2012, compared to £202 million 
in 2011. Underlying basic and diluted earnings per 
share were 52 pence and 51 pence respectively 
in 2012, compared to 56 pence and 55 pence, 
respectively, in 2011.

to the total outage rate.
Production performance was once again very strong 
in 2012. Plant availability of 86.0% for the year ended 
31 December 2012, compared to 88.4% in 2011, 
demonstrates our leadership position in the coal-ﬁred 
generation sector, with the impact of a double 
planned outage only marginally lowering availability. 
The forced outage and Winter forced outage rates 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 were 4.8% 
and 3.7% respectively, compared to 5.8% and 3.9% 
in 2011. Forced outage rates remain consistent with 
our long-term target of circa 5%.

The planned outage rate achieved for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 was 9.6%, compared to 
6.2% in 2011, with two major planned outages 
completed in 2012, compared to one major outage 
in 2011. Our maintenance regime includes a 
major planned outage for each of our six units 
once every four years. Consequently, there is an 
irregular pattern to planned outages and associated 
expenditure, since in two of the four years two units 
will each undergo a major planned outage. Two units 
will undergo a major planned outage in 2013. 
As a result of this performance, and the plant 
despatch dynamics described in Generation 
results above, our load factor for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was 81.6% compared to 79.7% 
in 2011. This is equivalent to 95% utilisation when 
available, and reﬂects an increase in electrical 
output (net power sales) to 27.1TWh in 2012 
compared with 26.4TWh in 2011.
Health and safety
Our lost time injury rate and total recordable injury 
rate were 0.06 and 0.17 respectively for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 compared to 0.08 and 
0.10 respectively in 2011. Our safety record continues 
to be industry-leading and was delivered alongside 
a signiﬁcant amount of project activity and a double 
outage in 2012. Our commitment to deliver a positive 
health and safety culture will continue. 
Liquidity and capital resources
Net cash was £311 million as at 31 December 2012, 
compared to £225 million at 31 December 2011. 
Cash and short-term deposits were £402 million as 
at 31 December 2012, compared to £233 million at 
31 December 2011. An analysis of cash ﬂows for both 
years is set out in the following table.

Cash generated from operations was £263 million 
in the year ended 31 December 2012, compared to 
£282 million in 2011. 
This includes the fall of £35 million in EBITDA, 
partially offset by a decrease in ROC and LEC assets 
in 2012 of £13 million compared to £1 million in 2011 
(as described in Generation results).
Also included in cash generated from operations 
for 2012 is an outﬂow of £39 million for carbon 
allowances purchased in advance for future periods 
(2011: £nil). 
The working capital outﬂow of £9 million in 2012 is 
driven by an increase of £30 million in the value of 
biomass stocks, offset by a reduction of £11 million 
in the value of coal stocks. Biomass and coal 
stock levels both increased at 31 December 2012 
by 0.2 million tonnes (to 0.4 million tonnes and 
1.6 million tonnes respectively) compared to 
the previous year end. However, as described 
in Commodity markets, coal prices have fallen 
signiﬁcantly over the last 18 months.

Governance
Corporate and social responsibility
The working capital outﬂow in 2011 of £51 million 
largely reﬂects an increase in the value of coal 
stocks (£24 million), and a lower carbon creditor 
(£21 million), both driven by commodity market 
price movements during 2011.
Income taxes paid were £51 million in the year ended 
31 December 2012, compared to £68 million in 2011. 
2012 payments include settlement of the 2011 
liability, as well as payments on account for 2012.
Net cash ﬂows from investing activities include 
payments in respect of capital expenditure of £206 
million for the year ended 31 December 2012 and 
£44 million in 2011 (see Capital expenditure). 2011 
also includes a reduction in short-term investments 
of £65 million comprising short-term deposits with 
a maturity of more than three months at inception. 
Net cash from ﬁnancing activities was £172 million 
in the year ended 31 December 2012, compared to 
net cash used in ﬁnancing activities of £253 million 
in 2011. The 2012 amount includes equity dividends 
paid of £96 million, net proceeds on the issue of 
share capital of £188 million and new borrowings 
drawn down in the year of £100 million. The 2011 
amount includes equity dividends paid of £124 million 
and term loan repayments of £135 million (see Capital 
resources and reﬁnancing). 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents was 
therefore £169 million in the year ended 31 December 
2012, compared to a decrease of £33 million in 2011. 
The Group’s policy is to invest available cash in short-
term bank, building society or other low risk deposits.
Capital resources and reﬁnancing 
On 25 October 2012, we announced the placing 
of approximately 36.5 million new ordinary shares. 
The placing raised £188 million net of expenses 
and was undertaken, alongside the other ﬁnancing 
activities described below, to secure the funding for 
our biomass transformation.
In July 2012 we announced agreement of a new 
£100 million amortising term loan facility with 
Prudential M&G UK Companies Financing Fund, 
subsequently fully drawn down just before year 
end. In December 2012 we secured up to a further 
£100 million amortising term loan facility, with the 
UK Green Investment Bank. Both loans have six to 
eight year maturities.
Also in December 2012 we completed the 
reﬁnancing of our £310 million revolving credit 
facility, due to mature in April 2014, repaying in the 
process the £10 million term loan previously drawn. 
This facility was replaced with a £400 million 
working capital and letter of credit facility which 
matures in April 2016. The margin on this new 
facility is 225 basis points above LIBOR.
G
Finally, as part of this reﬁnancing, we have also 
successfully executed a new commodity trading 
facility. This is an innovative new structure, we 
believe the ﬁrst of its kind in Europe, which allows us 
to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades 
at attractive pricing without the requirement to post 
collateral. It works by offering trading counterparties 
uncapped access to the security package available 
to our senior lenders. Interest in this new facility has 
been strong, and we already have a number of 
counterparties signed-up.
Standard and Poor’s have assigned a credit rating 
of BB+ to our new debt facilities. Over the past 
three years we have taken a number of steps to 
restructure our business and trading arrangements 
to enable us to operate successfully as either an 
investment grade or sub investment grade entity. 
These steps include the growth of Haven Power, 
execution of bilateral agreements with trading 
counterparties to cap collateral exposure, a shorter 
tenor to our trading strategy, implementation of 
the new commodity trading facility and increasing 
the quantum of our working capital/letter of 
credit facility. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect future developments, 
performance and position including principal 
risks and uncertainties are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s statement, this Operational and 
ﬁnancial performance and the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section which follows. Our cash ﬂows 
and borrowing facilities are described above. 
In addition, note 19 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements includes our approach to capital risk 
management, details on ﬁnancial instruments 
and hedging activities, and exposure to credit, 
counterparty and liquidity risk. 
We have signiﬁcant headroom in our new banking 
facilities, and a recent history of cash generation, 
strong covenant compliance, and good visibility in 
near-term forecasts, due to our progressive hedging 
strategy. Our Business Plan, taking account of our 
capital investment plans and reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, shows that we 
should be able to operate within the level of our 
current banking facilities. 
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, and continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting when preparing these 
ﬁnancial statements.

Seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices 
and despatch in the Winter period and lower despatch 
in the Summer months, when prices are lower and 
plant availability is affected by planned outages.
Accordingly, cash ﬂow during the Summer months 
is materially reduced due to the combined effect 
of lower prices and output, while maintenance 
expenditures are increased during this period due 
to major planned outages. The Group’s £400 million 
working capital and letter of credit facility assists 
in managing the cash low points in the cycle where 
required (see Capital resources and reﬁnancing). 
Creditor payment policy and practice
Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers when 
negotiating each transaction and the Group’s policy 
is to abide by those terms and pay creditors when 
sums owing fall due for payment, provided that the 
suppliers also comply with all relevant terms and 
conditions. Drax Group plc, the parent company of 
the Group, has no trade creditors. In respect of 
Group activities, the amounts due to trade creditors 
at 31 December 2012 represented approximately 
23 days of average daily purchases through the year 
(2011: 22 days). The ﬁgure is based upon the ratio 
of amounts owed to trade creditors against the 
amounts the Group was invoiced by suppliers during 
the ﬁnancial year. 
Capital expenditure and  
biomass transformation 
Fixed asset additions were £224 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2012, compared to £45 million 
in 2011.
2012 includes £180 million (2011: £5 million) of 
expenditure for our biomass transformation, being 
construction in progress for fuel delivery, storage 
and distribution systems. 
H
2012 also includes the ﬁnal instalment of our turbine 
upgrade project, which was completed on time and 
to budget. Since 2007, we have invested around 
£100 million to upgrade the high pressure and low 
pressure turbine modules on all six generating units 
to improve efﬁciency. The technology is performing 
to guarantee with all units achieving an overall 
baseload efﬁciency (that is, the ratio of energy 
out to energy in when operating at full capacity) 
approaching 40% at full load. This represents a 
5% improvement on original baseload efﬁciency 
of 38% and annual savings of 1 million tonnes of 
CO2 emissions allowances and approximately half 
a million tonnes of coal.
Looking forward, we expect total biomass 
transformation capital investment to be in 
the region of £650–£700 million (including 
the expenditure already incurred in 2012). 
This investment will allow us to progressively 
convert three generating units to biomass.
Approximately half of the total capital cost is 
investment in substantial equipment installations 
and modiﬁcations at the Drax Power Station site 
which commenced in 2012 as described above. 
The remainder is investment in upstream supply 
chain infrastructure, mainly pelleting facilities in 
the US, and any necessary work to ensure the plant 
is compliant with the Industrial Emissions Directive.
Our US pellet operations will be based on the 
Gulf Coast and will comprise of two pellet plants 
with combined capacity of 900,000 tonnes of 
pellet production per annum and a port facility with 
export capacity of up to 3 million tonnes per annum.
We expect to incur capital expenditure for the 
biomass transformation of around £200–£250 
million in 2013. By the end of 2014 we anticipate 
the Drax site development will be substantially 
complete and our US based pellet operations 
to be very well advanced. 
With the phased introduction of new plant and 
equipment, supported by the use of our existing 
biomass co-ﬁring systems, we expect to convert our 
ﬁrst unit in April 2013 and our second unit in 2014. 
Timing of the second and third unit conversion will 
depend on our progress with fuel sourcing. 
The Chief Executive’s statement provides more 
information in relation to our biomass 
transformation plans.

Contingent liability
We were obliged under the Community Energy 
Saving Programme (“CESP”) to deliver energy 
saving measures to domestic consumers during 
the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012. 
We entered into an agreement with a third party, 
pursuant to which the third party was obliged 
to deliver our CESP obligation for a total cost of 
£17 million. The third party has failed to comply fully 
with its obligation under the agreement, leaving a 
signiﬁcant shortfall against our CESP obligation. 
We will be considering legal proceedings for breach 
of contract against this third party. We have entered 
into further agreements with additional third parties 
in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable.
At this stage it is not possible to predict whether any 
enforcement action may be imposed. No additional 
provisions have been recognised in respect of this 
matter as we are not able to reliably measure what 
the ﬁnancial impact, if any, might be. See note 32 
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 
further details.
Future developments 
Positions under contract for 2013, 2014 and 2015
We continue to follow our stated trading strategy 
of making steady forward power sales with 
corresponding purchases of CO2 emissions 
allowances and fuel purchases. Our aim is to 
deliver market level dark green and bark spreads 
across all traded market periods and, as part of this 
strategy, we retain power to be sold into the prompt 
(within season) power markets.
As at 11 February 2013, the positions under contract

2010, with Centrica.
Fixed margin power sales include approximately 
2.4TWh in 2013, 2.6TWh in 2014 and 1.9TWh in 2015 
in connection with the above contract.
Under this contract the Group will supply power on 
terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based 
on international coal prices, and delivering matching 
CO2 emissions allowances amounting in aggregate 
to approximately 2.4 million tonnes in both 2013 and 
2014, and approximately 1.8 million tonnes in 2015. 
The contract provides the Group with a series of 
ﬁxed dark green spreads agreed in October 2009.
Distributions
Distribution policy
The Board has previously committed to a pay-out 
ratio of 50% of underlying earnings (being proﬁt 
attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to 
exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts and exceptional 
items) in each year. Underlying earnings for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 were £193 million.
Dividends paid 
On 20 February 2012 the Board resolved, subject 
to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) on 18 April 2012, to pay a ﬁnal 
dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 
11.8 pence per share (£43 million). The ﬁnal dividend 
was paid on 11 May 2012.
On 30 July 2012, the Board resolved to pay an interim 
dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2012 
of 14.4 pence per share (£53 million), representing 
50% of underlying earnings for the period. The 
interim dividend was paid on 12 October 2012.
Dividends proposed
At the forthcoming AGM the Board will recommend 
to shareholders that a resolution is passed to 
approve payment of a ﬁnal dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 of 10.9 pence per share 
(£44 million), payable on or before 17 May 2013. 
Shares will be marked ex-dividend on 24 April 2013.
This Operational and ﬁnancial performance was 
approved by the Board on 18 February 2013.

Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
A process has been established for identifying, 
evaluating, determining risk appetite and managing 
the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group and this 
has been in place for the year under review up to 
the date of approval of the 2012 Annual report 
and accounts. The process is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Risk management committees
There are six risk management committees:
1
Treasury and commodity risk 
management committee
2
Safety, health, environmental and 
production integrity committee
3
Business development risk 
management committee
4
Corporate risk management committee
5
Haven Power risk management committee
6
US business risk management committee
Each Committee is responsible for ensuring that 
all risks associated with their speciﬁc area of the 
business are identiﬁed, analysed and managed 
systematically and appropriately. Each Committee 
has terms of reference that requires it to ensure 
that systems and controls are approved, 
implemented and monitored to ensure that 
activities are commensurate with the risk appetite 
established by the Board, are adequately resourced 
and comply with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. Each risk committee contains at 
least one member of the Executive Committee.
Principal risks and uncertainties
A structured approach…
The effective management of risks within the Group underpins the delivery 
of our key priorities. 
The Group has a comprehensive structure of governance controls in place 
to manage risks. Policies have been established in key areas of the business 
such as trading, treasury, production and health and safety to ensure that 
these risks are managed in a controlled manner and in accordance with 
the policies set by the Board.

Overview
Risk management process
The key elements of the risk management process 
are as follows:
Risk identiﬁcation – risks faced by the Group are 
identiﬁed during the formulation of the Business 
Plan. Senior management and risk owners, with the 
assistance of the risk management committees, 
periodically review the risks to ensure that the risk 
management processes and controls in their area 
are appropriate and effective, and that new risks 
are identiﬁed.
Risk analysis – the basic causes of each risk are 
considered, and the impact and likelihood of it 
materialising is assessed. Risk registers are used to 
document the risks identiﬁed, level of severity and 
probability, ownership and mitigation measures for 
each risk. The risk registers are reviewed by the 
risk management committees on at least a 
quarterly basis.
Risks are then logged with reference to impact 
and probability as follows:
Risk appetite is identiﬁed by reference to the same 
criteria. The analysis enables decisions to be taken 
as to how that risk should be managed by applying 
mitigation measures to align the risk with the 
identiﬁed risk appetite.
Risk monitoring and assurance – the Board is 
ultimately responsible for this system of risk 
management and internal control. The Audit 
Committee reviews ﬁnancial information and the 
suitability of internal controls on behalf of the Board. 
Risk management committees assist the executive 
directors in the operation and implementation of the 
risk management process, and provide a source of 
assurance to the Audit Committee that the process 
is operating effectively. 
Internal control
In addition, the Group has comprehensive and 
well deﬁned control policies with clear structures, 
delegated authority levels and accountabilities. 
The Group has a system of planning and monitoring, 
which incorporates Board approval of a rolling ﬁve 
year Business Plan and approval, towards the end 
of each year, of operating and capital expenditure 
budgets for the year ahead. Performance against 
the budget is subsequently monitored and reported 
to the Board on a monthly basis. The Board also 
receives monthly reports on trading risk exposure 
as compared to the pre-set limits, and monitors 
overall Group performance against a Balanced 
Corporate Scorecard which shows progress against 
a set of ﬁnancial, operating, safety and other targets 
set at the start of the year. Performance is reported 
formally to shareholders through the publication of 
Group results. Operational management makes frequent 
reports on performance to the executive directors.
The Group also has processes in place for business 
continuity and emergency planning.
Through the Audit Committee, the Board has 
implemented a programme of internal audit 
reviews of different aspects of the Group’s activities. 
The programme, which is reviewed and updated 
annually, is designed so that, over time, all facets 
of the business are reviewed to ensure appropriate 
systems of control are in place and are working 
effectively or, where they are not, deﬁciencies are 
rectiﬁed by timely and appropriate action. In agreeing 
the actions to be taken in response to each report, 
the aim is always to embed internal controls, 
including measures intended effectively to identify 
and manage risk, within each area of the Group’s 
operations. In parallel with its work in relation to 
internal audit, the Audit Committee also satisﬁes 
itself that an action plan, for dealing with points 
raised by the external auditor in their yearly 
management letter is being properly addressed 
by management.
With the assistance of the Audit Committee, 
the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of 
the system of internal control. It has reviewed 
the reports of the Audit Committee, which has 
considered all signiﬁcant aspects of internal control 
including ﬁnancial, operational, trading, compliance, 
social, environmental and ethical risks in accordance 
with the “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors 
on the UK Corporate Governance Code”.
Following its review, the Board determined that 
it was not aware of any signiﬁcant deﬁciency or 
material weakness in the system of internal control.

Overview
Biomass market risk
Plant operating risk
Regulatory and political risk
Context
Sustainable biomass is well placed to 
provide the UK with low cost and ﬂexible 
renewable power, and contribute to 
meeting carbon reduction targets
Risk
 
kWe could fail to secure sustainable 
biomass supplies and/or logistics 
arrangements which meet our hurdle 
return rates and operational requirements.
 
kMost of the sustainable biomass that we 
can procure is priced in foreign currency 
which increases our exposure to 
ﬂuctuations against sterling and poses 
a risk to proﬁtability.
Potential impact
 
kInability to progress the biomass 
growth strategy. 
 
kAdverse effect on ﬁnancial results 
and cash ﬂows.
Associated objective and key priorities
 
kDeliver our biomass strategy.

on personnel and operations
Risk
 
kPlant failure may be caused by the 
underperformance or outright failure of 
plant, transmission assets or other 
equipment and components including the 
IT systems used to operate the plant or 
conduct trading activities. The duration of 
the resultant forced outages is inﬂuenced 
by the lead time to manufacture and 
procure replacement components and to 
carry out repairs.
 
kAs we progress our plans to convert to a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, 
we are exposed to a broader range, and 
increased level, of technical risk.
Potential impact
 
kPersonnel injury.
 
kLower revenues.
 
kIncreased costs and contractual penalties.
 
kAdverse effect on ﬁnancial results 
and cash ﬂows.
Associated objective and key priorities

kDeliver excellent people leadership 
across our operations.
Context
The Government’s market reform agenda 
is driven predominantly by the need to 
move to a sustainable, low carbon energy 
sector which delivers affordable supplies 
to customers whilst maintaining security 
of supply over the longer term. Laws and 
regulations are many and complex, are 
frequently changing, and becoming ever 
more stringent, particularly in relation 
to environmental matters
Risk
 
kChanges to the current regulatory regime 
surrounding renewables, Carbon Price 
Support and other legislation could 
adversely affect our biomass strategy.
 
kThe EU, UK and local environmental and 
health and safety laws and regulations 
cover many aspects of our operations 
including limits on emissions to air 
and water, noise, soil/groundwater 
contamination, waste, and health 
and safety standards.
Potential impact
 
kLess funding available for plant retroﬁt/
investment costs to meet increasingly 
stringent environmental requirements.
 
kLower load factors/generation levels.
 
kAdverse effect on ﬁnancial results

Corporate and social responsibility
Committed to responsibility…
Our approach to corporate and social responsibility
We operate our business within a framework of increasingly stringent and 
challenging legislative and regulatory requirements. We are, however, mindful 
of the still tougher expectations held by our wider stakeholder group. For us, 
corporate and social responsibility is about achieving a balance between the 
commercial and regulatory rigours of the competitive sector within which we 
operate and our commitment to our stakeholders as a whole.
The Board has ultimate control of policies in respect of both the wider corporate 
responsibility, such as our business conduct, and our environmental, health 
and safety programmes. The Board’s policies are implemented by dedicated 
specialists who make sure effective processes and procedures are in place 
to assure compliance and to identify and to report on risks and opportunities.
As in previous years we have continued to invest, not only to comply with 
environmental and health and safety requirements, but, where practicable, 
to go further. In 2012, we retained our presence in the FTSE4Good Index 
Series, which is designed to measure the performance of companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards and facilitate investment 
in those companies.

Overview
Materiality
Given the diversity of our stakeholders there are a 
wide range of topics and performance measures 
on which we could report. In determining which to 
report we consider their materiality in terms of their 
relevance to the Company and their importance 
to stakeholders.
Throughout this Annual report and accounts 
we aim to report on topics and performance 
measures that represent our signiﬁcant economic, 
environmental, and social impacts and those that 
would substantively inﬂuence the assessments 
and decisions of stakeholders. Further reporting 
is undertaken in accordance with the Global 
Reporting Initiative framework and is available 
on our website at:

Business conduct
Our commitment to integrity
We have a commitment to high ethical standards 
and to conduct our business with honesty, 
integrity and in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations. 
Our reputation for acting with integrity plays 
a critical role in our success. Integrity not only 
underpins how we do business, but how we expect 
our suppliers, agents, partners, contractors and 
consultants to do business, whether in the UK, 
US or beyond. We are committed to preventing 
bribery and corruption and take responsibility for 
maintaining a culture within the Group in which 
bribery is never acceptable.
We ensure that all third parties we deal with are 
reputable, by means of carrying out “Know Your 
Customer” due diligence checks and searches, 
and have formed an Ethics and Business 
Conduct committee to escalate problematic 
counterparty requests.
Code of Business Ethics
The Group’s Code of Business Ethics establishes the 
rules and framework under which employees should 
base their decision making. Employees are expected 
to follow not only the letter of the Code, but the spirit.
Whistleblowing
The Group’s whistleblowing policy provides a 
conﬁdential means for our employees to speak up 
with conﬁdence. The policy provides guidance on 
how to make a disclosure of information, in good 
faith, relating to some danger, fraud or other illegal 
or unethical conduct that they may have witnessed 
or are concerned about.
Climate change and the environment
Tackling climate change
We believe we have an important role to play in the 
transition of the UK towards a low carbon economy 
whilst maintaining secure and affordable supplies of 
electricity. For us, a sustainable business principally 
implies delivering on our commitment to generating 
electricity from sustainable biomass and continuing 
to improve thermal efﬁciency as the major, strategic 
carbon abatement initiatives.
The centre of our improved thermal efﬁciency 
programme at the power station over the last ﬁve 
years has been the £100 million upgrade of the high 
pressure and low pressure steam turbines of each 
of our six generating units. In 2012 we saw the 
completion of the programme, which was the largest 
steam turbine modernisation programme in UK 
history. The project was delivered within budget and 
planned timescale, and the plant is beneﬁting from 
an increase in overall efﬁciency and a reduction in 
CO2 emissions.
The biomass future for the Group is now more 
certain, with clarity on the support level for 
the technology provided by the Government, 
the committed ﬁnancing and the expertise gained 
from our extensive research and development in 
this area. Major works were undertaken in 2012 
towards the construction of dedicated biomass 
receipt, handling and storage facilities. This work 
will continue in 2013 and 2014 as we press ahead to 
become a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator.
Through increasing the amount of sustainable 
biomass burnt in place of coal we will signiﬁcantly 
reduce our carbon footprint on today’s levels. 
The average greenhouse gas saving across the 
range of sustainable biomass materials burnt in 
place of coal in 2012 was above 80% using the 
life cycle emissions of coal burnt at Drax Power 
Station as the baseline. 
In addition to our thermal efﬁciency and biomass 
development work, in partnership with Alstom 
UK Limited and National Grid Carbon Limited, 
we continued to develop plans to build a 426MW 
oxyfuel carbon capture and storage demonstration 
plant at the Drax Power Station site. In January 
2012, we were joined by industrial gas provider, 
BOC (a member of The Linde Group) as a co-sponsor 
of the project. Viability of the project is dependent 
on external funding and the introduction of a market 
mechanism to support low carbon technology 
uptake. To that end we are participating in UK 
and EU funding programmes.

Corporate and social responsibility
Environmental performance and compliance
We fully understand the responsibilities we have to 
society and the environment and we are committed 
to furthering the environmental leadership position 
we hold in the coal-ﬁred sector. 
Environmental compliance of our power station 
and associated landﬁll site is managed through an 
environmental management system (“EMS”). 
This system is externally certiﬁed to the international 
standard ISO 14001 and is subject to external audit 
twice a year.
We are currently undertaking a trial with the 
Environment Agency in the Environmental 
Permitting Compliance Assurance Scheme. 
The scheme is intended to reduce regulatory burden 
on the best performing sites, whilst maintaining 
an adequate level of oversight through combining 
assessment of speciﬁc legal compliance with 
certiﬁcation to ISO 14001. We expect to conclude 
the trial in 2013, and we will continue to work with 
the Environment Agency to determine the ongoing 
approach to regulation in the future.
We are pleased to report that there were no major 
breaches of our environmental consents during 2012.
Emissions to air
We manage all our emissions effectively and have 
maintained high levels of investment in ﬂue gas 
desulphurisation and combustion control systems 
to ensure compliance with environmental limits. 
We saw a record level of generation in 2012, 
which resulted in corresponding increases in mass 
emissions from the power station. All emissions 
were, however, within the limits set by the 
Environment Agency.
Looking ahead, work continues to develop a solution 
to optimise compliance with the anticipated emission 
limits which will be in place beyond 2016 under the 
Industrial Emissions Directive.

Disposals to land
We have continued to invest in site infrastructure 
to maximise the sale of ash products into the 
construction industry and to reduce the disposal 
of surplus ash to landﬁll. In 2012, ash was sold 
in conformance with European construction 
product standards and in compliance with the 
Waste Recycling Action Programme (“WRAP”) 
quality protocol.
This has helped us to sell over 60% of the 
1.5 million tonnes of ash produced in 2012 as 
replacement for virgin aggregates and as a 
cement replacement product.
In 2012, construction started on the lightweight 
aggregate production facility on site, which is 
owned and will be operated by Lytag Ltd, a company 
based in Escrick, North Yorkshire. The facility will 
manufacture lightweight aggregate from pulverised 
fuel ash; production is expected to start in 2013.
Any unsold ash is sent to the power station’s ash 
disposal site, Barlow Mound. The completed area 
of the site has been fully restored for use as farm 
land and woodland.
We pay landﬁll tax on the ash disposed of to the site. 
Through the Landﬁll Communities Fund, we are able 
to claim a tax credit for our donations to recognised 
Environmental Bodies. We have worked with 
Groundwork North Yorkshire since 2001 on projects 
designed to help mitigate the effects of landﬁll upon 
our local community. During 2012, we contributed 
£62,888 towards local community-based projects 
designed to bring about sustainable environmental 
beneﬁts and contribute to the social and economic 
regeneration of the area.
We continue to manage waste from our operations 
in a responsible manner. In 2012 we met our target 
to divert 90% of non-ash waste from landﬁll.
Alternative fuels
To safeguard cost-effective power production, 
our fuel strategy recognises the need to procure a 
ready supply of traditional quality coal and how best 
to incorporate alternative fuels, including different 
fossil fuels and renewable and sustainable biomass 
materials. The choice of fuels has to be balanced 
with availability and ﬂexibility of supply.
The use of petcoke is now routine and our monitoring 
indicates that there is no discernible environmental 
impact on the local air quality. In line with our policy 
on openness and transparency all data are discussed 
with the Environment Agency and local councils.

Overview
Supply chain
Non-fuel procurement
Overall, we take a balanced approach to our 
supply chain and we look to use suppliers and 
working partners from diverse backgrounds, 
in particular, small and medium-sized suppliers 
in the local community.
Sustainability is an essential element of good 
procurement practice and takes account of wider 
social, economic and environmental factors in 
addition to the conventional criteria of price, quality 
and service. By applying these wider principles our 
procurement practices go beyond meeting simple 
tender requirements to delivering improved value 
and real cost savings throughout the supply chain. 
Coal procurement
We currently purchase around 9 to 10 million tonnes 
of steam coal each year. This will fall gradually as 
three of our generating units are converted to 
burn sustainable biomass, starting from this 
year. We buy from a range of sources with the 
objectives of managing our commercial exposures, 
environmental obligations and diversity of supply. 
We continue to purchase just under half of the coal 
from UK deep and surface mines with the remainder 
coming from major supply basins around the world, 
including USA, Colombia and Russia.
When buying from overseas we have introduced 
a process of documenting, in our contracts, 
the minimum standards we expect from our 
suppliers in respect of compliance with legislation, 
human rights, labour relations, health and safety 
arrangements and business ethics.
Biomass sustainability and procurement
Biomass use is a high priority, but it is a 
prerequisite that all our biomass must be purchased 
from a sustainable source. To ensure this we have 
implemented a sustainability policy which embeds 
comprehensive criteria into our procurement 
activities with the aim of assuring the sustainability 
of the biomass supply. Our Biomass Sustainability 
Management System ensures commitment to 
our policy.
We are at the forefront of the introduction of 
credible sustainability standards into biomass 
procurement activities. Our procurement process 
is designed to ensure that the production and 
delivery of biomass will:
 
k signiﬁcantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
compared to coal-ﬁred generation;
 
k not result in a net release of carbon from the 
vegetation and soil of either forests or 
agricultural lands;
 
k not endanger food supply or communities where 
the use of biomass is essential for subsistence 
(for example heat, medicines, building materials);
 
k not adversely affect protected or vulnerable 
biodiversity and, where possible, give 
preference to biomass production that 
strengthens biodiversity;
 
k deploy good practices to protect and/or improve 
soil, water (both ground and surface) and 
air quality;
 
k contribute to local prosperity in the area of supply 
chain management and biomass production; and
 
k contribute to the social wellbeing of employees 
and the local population in the area of the 
biomass production.
We work collaboratively with our suppliers to ensure 
compliance with the UK’s sustainability requirements 
under the Renewables Obligation. Conﬁdence in the 
sustainability of the biomass is achieved through a 
programme of information exchange, documentary 
evidence, due diligence activities and independent 
third-party veriﬁcation.
Later this year, the Government is scheduled to 
introduce a legislative requirement to comply 
with sustainability criteria in order to receive 
regulatory support. This will necessitate an annual 
limited assurance audit for compliance purposes. 
In preparation for this we have commissioned 
external auditors to undertake an ISAE 3000 
audit of our performance and system robustness, 
which will be fully integrated within the Biomass 
Sustainability Management System.
Health and safety
Health and safety is at the heart of our corporate 
responsibility. Protecting our employees, contractors 
and all visitors from injury is fundamental to our 
business philosophy. We are committed to 
developing and maintaining a positive health and 
safety culture in which statutory requirements are 
viewed as a minimum standard and leading 
performance as our goal.

Attaining leading performance
The lost time injury rate and total recordable 
injury rate for 2012 at 0.06 and 0.17 respectively, 
remain industry-leading. Maintaining this level of 
performance is commendable given the signiﬁcant 
construction work that took place during the year 
and number of man-hours worked, which at the Drax 
Power Station site totalled some 4 million. Our safety 
record continues to compare very favourably with 
that of our sector peers and international 
benchmarks. Amongst global comparator coal-ﬁred 
power stations we are ahead of the European and 
World Pacesetter group for total recordable injury 
rate, which is a clear indication that the safety 
management system implemented in the last few 
years is delivering sustained levels of performance.
We have been successful in retaining certiﬁcation 
of our Health and Safety Management System to the 
internationally recognised Occupational Health and 
Safety standard, OHSAS 18001, at the Drax Power 
Station site and we have attained certiﬁcation for 
our straw pellet plant, based at Goole in the East 
Riding of Yorkshire. Drax Power Station is one of a 
select group of large coal-ﬁred power stations in the 
country to hold this standard, which is approved by 
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance.
In addition to this, we were pleased, once again, 
to be awarded the RoSPA Gold Medal Award 
having achieved Gold Award standards for eight 
consecutive years.
Safety leadership and recognition
We are constantly striving to improve the critical 
safety leadership contribution required from ﬁrst 
line supervisors. The expectations of both 
management and supervisors continue to be 
reafﬁrmed in the Safety Leadership Charter.
A Health and Safety Advisory Committee 
(“HESAC”), which brings together a range of 
employees, including trade union representatives, 
safety representatives, occupational health and 
management team members, continues to play a 
vital role in facilitating staff consultation on health 
and safety issues, and driving standards upwards.
Our active involvement with the programmes of 
our trade body, Energy UK, and the Coal Generators 
Forum, GENSIP, continues to provide new ideas 
and a stimulus to drive our health and safety 
improvement efforts forward.
Employees
Employment
The Group employed 1,163 people at the year end. 
Most of our employees work full-time and are on 
permanent contracts. Recruitment activity during 
2012 saw the headcount at our operating subsidiary, 
Drax Power Limited, increase by 26 and we now 
employ 15 staff in our US ofﬁce under Drax Biomass 
International.
Turnover of staff remains low at Drax Power Limited 
with an annual staff turnover rate of 5.8%, mostly 
due to voluntary retirement. The average length 
of service is 13 years and 32% of the workforce 
has been with the company for 20 years or more. 
This high level of retention is particularly pleasing 
as our business requires skills and experience which 
are difﬁcult to source externally. Absence rates are 
consistently low, at around 2% per annum.
At Haven Power, the annual staff turnover rate 
is 35.9%, which is indicative of the nature of 
the business and the demographic proﬁle 
of the workforce.
We maintain high standards in employment 
practices. For example, equality and inclusion 
is respected, and managers and employee 
representatives are trained and supported to ensure 
the speedy and clear resolution of queries and 
grievances. We review our policies and procedures 
on a regular basis to ensure legal compliance and 
improved service levels.
Employee relations
Some 45% of our UK workforce (520 people) are 
covered by collective bargaining arrangements. 
Formal negotiation and consultation takes place 
through the Company Committee – a joint 
management and union body that meets regularly to 
discuss working practices and terms and conditions 
of employment for production employees, and to 
receive updates on the Group’s strategy.
Employees in the corporate functions and senior 
production staff at Drax Power Limited, and all staff 
at Haven Power and Drax Biomass International are 
employed on personal contracts, which are not 
covered by collective bargaining. Formal information 
and consultation arrangements are in place for these 
groups of staff, so that any proposals for change can 
be discussed openly and with sufﬁcient time to build 
in revisions arising out of the consultation.

Overview
Learning and development
Our personal and career development processes 
across the Group are designed to equip all our 
people with the technical skills, management 
and leadership competencies, and personal 
behaviours needed to achieve our Business Plan. 
All employees receive annual performance and 
career development reviews. Individual targets 
are reviewed and assessed formally through interim 
and ﬁnal appraisal discussions with their manager. 
Personal development plans include both technical 
training and behavioural development, which are 
delivered through a rolling programme of internal 
and external learning events.
In 2012, we continued our supervisor development 
programme in partnership with Coventry University. 
Through a series of workshops, an action learning 
project and a 12-week secondment into a supervisory 
position, the participants were able to develop their 
leadership capability. This year’s project was 
implemented in partnership with the Smallpeice 
Trust, an independent educational charity that 
runs hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM) activities for pupils in 
Years 6–12. 
Each year we recruit for our sponsored four-year 
apprentice training programme covering power 
station operations and engineering maintenance. 
In 2012, we took on ten apprentices across the 
three disciplines of mechanical, electrical and 
control & instrumentation.
Succession planning
In 2012, we introduced a structured process of 
succession planning for senior roles with a speciﬁc 
career management discussion integrated within 
the existing appraisal process. The process follows 
an annual cycle of discussion, implementation 
and review, and identiﬁes succession pipelines 
and gaps, and provides a framework for individual 
development/recruitment planning.
Internal communications
We use a variety of communication channels to 
ensure that all colleagues are kept fully informed 
of developments in the Group’s operations and 
have an opportunity to provide feedback.
Open Forums for Drax Power Limited staff 
provide a series of face-to-face meetings where 
the Chief Executive and Executive Committee 
present business updates to small groups, 
followed by an open question and answer session. 
In addition, our all-employee communication 
methods include monthly team briefs and e-mail 
and intranet communications.
At Haven Power monthly staff brieﬁngs are 
delivered by the management team. The staff 
brieﬁngs provide an update on current performance 
against the Business Plan and communicate key 
business updates. Staff forums and one-to-one 
discussions also take place routinely. In addition, 
monthly team meetings and various events are 
facilitated throughout the year promoting staff 
engagement. The intranet continues to grow 
providing a central location for news stories, 
documentation and brieﬁngs. 
Diversity and equality
We have established a policy to ensure that gender 
diversity is one of the factors taken into account 
when considering future appointments to the Board 
and other senior appointments, and in line with the 
Equality Act 2010, we have updated our diversity 
and equality policy and our dignity at work policy. 
The Group is committed to ensuring that none of 
the protected characteristics, such as age, race and 
religion, which underpin the Equality Act are barriers 
to working for us.
Performance and reward
Our pay and beneﬁts are competitive. We benchmark 
our reward packages at every level in the organisation 
against the industry sector and the market as a whole, 
nationally or locally, as appropriate to the role. 
We also participate in specialist industry meetings 
to exchange information and developments in 
employment policy.
Through a range of share plans we encourage all UK 
employees to build a personal stake in the ownership 
of the business. 
Recognition
The achievements of our staff have been recognised 
through a number of awards and shortlistings for 
awards from external bodies during 2012.
The Forest Footprint Disclosure scheme is an 
innovative initiative assisting businesses in assessing 
their impact on the world’s forests. For the fourth year 
running, Drax was ranked as the leader in the utilities 
sector based on the comprehensive sustainability 
criteria in our business procurement activities.

Corporate and social responsibility
This year staff at Haven Power helped the 
company to achieve the accolade of No. 1 for 
customer satisfaction in the small and medium 
enterprise (“SME”) market in the external 2012 
Datamonitor Survey.
We were among the ﬁnalists for the Capital 
Project Management Award of the Utility Industry 
Achievements Awards 2012 for our turbine upgrade 
project, a ﬁve-year-long project which was 
completed in 2012.
For the second time in the past three years we were 
acknowledged for upholding good governance and 
professional standards at the ICSA (Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators) Hermes 
Transparency in Governance Awards 2012, through 
winning the “Best sustainability and stakeholder 
disclosure – FTSE250”.
Health and wellbeing
We are committed to promoting the health and 
wellbeing of all our staff and ensuring a professional 
response to all ﬁrst aid and emergency situations 
that occur.
We have published occupational health policies 
which address industrial disease risks, and our 
occupational health team undertakes regular 
programmes to screen colleagues who are in 
contact with, for example, high noise levels or dust. 
Everyone working in operational areas has a general 
medical every three years.
Some categories of worker are exposed to materials 
which may pose a risk to health, such as chemicals 
and process dust. In these cases, more speciﬁc 
health surveillance, such as lung function tests, 
hearing tests and eyesight tests are undertaken 
through an ongoing programme managed in 
accordance with risk, exposure and Health and 
Safety Executive requirements. Driving and driver 
training support programmes are in place for those 
who travel frequently on business.
Each year we have a planned programme of health 
promotion. In 2012, Drax Power Limited received 
the bronze level Healthy Heart award from Heart 
Research UK in recognition of various initiatives 
including a “Quit Smoking” programme and other 
campaigns to encourage healthy diet, exercise 
and lifestyle. 
At Haven Power we aim to create a supportive, 
healthy and safe environment for all employees. 
Our employment policies aim to promote an 
environment that ensures the health and wellbeing 
of all employees, creating a dynamic environment 
where people can excel including health screening 
and occupational health support where required. 
We run a variety of initiatives throughout the year 
promoting a healthy lifestyle including “quit smoking” 
days, cancer awareness, walk to work and other 
employee-driven events that focus on improving 
individual wellbeing.
All of the UK workforce is represented in formal joint 
management-worker health and safety committees 
that help monitor and advise on occupational health 
and safety programmes. The committees have 
senior management representation, with trade 
union or employee representatives.
Pension provision and retirement
There are 356 employees who are members of the 
Drax Power Group of the Electricity Supply Pension 
Scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 2002. 
All other UK employees are eligible to join the Group 
Personal Pension Plan or the Haven Power Personal 
Pension Plan, which are both actively promoted to 
new recruits. Any UK employee aged 55 or over is 
eligible to take their accrued retirement beneﬁts, 
in line with the statutory minimum age for receipt 
of an occupational pension.
At Drax Power Limited, our phased retirement policy 
means that any employee aged 55 or over may apply 
to take accrued retirement beneﬁts and continue to 
work part-time subject to operational requirements. 
For employees approaching their chosen retirement 
age we offer paid pre-retirement leave and pre-
retirement courses to help people transition 
smoothly from working life to their new life.
A ﬂexible retirement policy is operated at Haven 
Power, and employees may voluntarily retire at a 
time of their choosing. Employees aged 65 or over, 
who are members of the Haven Power Personal 
Pension Plan remain entitled to the beneﬁts of 
the scheme.

Corporate and social responsibility
Overview
Stakeholder engagement 
and community relations
Engaging with our stakeholders
Like many businesses, our stakeholders are many 
and diverse, including our shareholders, employees, 
customers, suppliers, the local community, 
Government, non-governmental organisations, 
regulators, opinion formers and the media. 
Communication with all our stakeholders is 
considered to be an essential part of our business 
and we aim to be open and transparent in all that 
we do. Reference has been already made to speciﬁc 
stakeholder engagement practice and exercises 
throughout this Corporate and social responsibility 
section; below we touch on other aspects of our 
stakeholder engagement commitments, from 
investor relations to community relations.
Investor relations
We are committed to delivering shareholder value. 
We communicate our results and prospects to our 
shareholders in an accurate and timely manner 
using a variety of channels. In addition to the Annual 
General Meeting, we communicate through our 
Annual report and accounts, Half year report and 
Interim Management Statements. All of these 
documents are made available on our website at 
www.draxgroup.plc.uk. Signiﬁcant matters relating 
to trading and the development of the business 
are disseminated to the market by way of 
announcements via a regulatory information 
service and those announcements appear as soon 
as practicable on our website.
Announcements are frequently followed up with 
either conference calls or presentations to provide 
further detail and greater understanding. In addition, 
face-to-face meetings are held with our major 
institutional shareholders, and other potential 
investors in the Group, again to assist them in their 
understanding of the announcements, but also to 
ensure that the Board is aware of their views and 
concerns. To aid our communication with private 
investors, the investor section of our website has 
been developed to be a readily accessible and 
transparent source of information to enhance 
understanding of the business.
External relations
As in previous years, we maintained our 
engagement with public affairs audiences on issues 
with implications for our business. With energy 
policy still high on the political agenda we had 
signiﬁcant engagement with Parliamentarians and 
ofﬁcials at all levels on issues including forthcoming 
environmental legislation, renewables policy and 
market reform issues.
The form of engagement was varied and 
included both face-to-face and written brieﬁngs, 
participation in public consultations, written 
evidence to inquiries, and visits by Parliamentarians 
and ofﬁcials to Drax Power Station. As in the past, 
trade association membership proved useful during 
the year. The ability to meet with and discuss 
issues of the day with other interested parties has 
facilitated representation of collective positions 
on energy policy matters.
No political donations were made in the UK or 
elsewhere during 2012 (2011: nil), and the Group’s 
contact with those active in the political arena has 
been and will continue to be aimed solely at the 
promotion of the Group’s business interests.
The deﬁnitions of EU political expenditure are 
broad and there is widespread doubt about the 
extent to which normal business activities, which 
might not be thought to be political expenditure in 
the usual sense, could be considered to be political 
expenditure within the meaning of the legislation. 
The Company wishes to avoid any inadvertent 
infringement of the legislation and each year, 
though a resolution at the Annual General Meeting, 
seeks the authority of shareholders to incur 
expenditure for the Company and its subsidiaries 
for such purposes of £100,000.
Community relations
We are committed to being a good neighbour to our 
local community and our “caring for the community” 
philosophy involves being part of local and regional 
communities. Our involvement takes the form 
of sponsoring a variety of local charities and 
fundraising events, promoting our own campaigns 
which focus on the three themes of youth sport, 
education and the environment, and maintaining 
open communication channels and good working 
relationships with the region’s key opinion formers.
Sponsorship and fundraising
During 2012, the Group gave ﬁnancial support of 
£182,000 (2011: £137,000) in total across a range 
of charitable and non-charitable community causes. 
Of that total, charitable donations amounted to 
£127,000 (2011: £94,000).

Contributing to the 
local community
We are committed to being a good neighbour 
to our local community and our “caring for the 
community” philosophy involves being part of local 
and regional communities. Our involvement takes 
the form of sponsoring a variety of local charities 
and fundraising events, promoting our own 
campaigns and maintaining open communications 
channels with the region’s key opinion formers.

Corporate and social responsibility
Overview
Corporate and social responsibility
Some £18,000 of the total donations were made 
under the direction of our sponsorship team, 
across a range of activities within a 20-mile radius 
of the power station. Each month the team meets to 
consider requests received for charitable donations 
and community sponsorship and makes awards 
against our criteria of furthering community, 
environmental and sporting interests.
Drax also operates a “£ for £” and Give As You 
Earn matching scheme, under which we match 
any monies raised for, or donated to, charity by 
employees. During 2012, some £53,000 of the total 
donations made were through these schemes.
Now in its eighth year, the outage charity scheme 
raised £12,000 during the year’s two planned 
outages. Through the scheme £500 is donated for 
every seven days that goes by without an injury 
requiring more than ﬁrst aid treatment. The money 
was divided equally between four charities chosen 
by Drax staff and our contractors. A further £1,000 
was donated to local charities following a fundraising 
event held at our annual safety conference for 
contractors and staff.
For the sixth year running we held a charity 
corporate golf tournament at Fulford Golf Club, 
York. The event raised just under £15,000 for 
the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, which provides a 
crucial emergency service for the region. We were 
honoured to receive a recognition award from the 
Yorkshire Air Ambulance for the donations made 
over the years, approaching some £50,000, 
through the golf tournament.
Education in the community
We provide a choice of educational experiences 
hosted by our team of power station guides and, 
at times, technical experts. A state-of-the-art 
visitor centre is of particular interest to students 
of all ages allowing them to explore the properties 
of electricity, discover how a power station works 
and consider the environmental issues related to 
electricity generation.
Combined with a tour of the power station, 
students can learn about the basic principles 
and development of electricity generation, 
the role of different fuels in electricity generation, 
trading of electricity, environmental issues related 
to burning fossil fuels, the recycling of by-products 
and the role of a large industrial complex in the 
local economy and community.
Another visitor opportunity exists at our nature 
reserve that lies at the heart of our ash disposal site. 
Established as a sanctuary for over 100 species of 
wildlife, it is specially designed to help schoolchildren 
understand more about the natural habitat and 
ecology of the area.
Educational visits are complemented by the Skylark 
Centre which provides classroom and laboratory 
facilities where teachers and students can discuss 
and investigate the results of pond dipping, a bugs 
and grubs hunt, or a nature trail walk through 
woodland areas. These facilities were enhanced 
during 2012 with the construction of a new Skylark 
Centre building equipped with the latest technology 
to assist the schoolchildren with their nature studies. 
The new centre was opened by Olympic gold 
medallist, Nicola Adams.
Our “Cricket in the Community” initiative, 
launched in May 2006, has continued to prove 
popular with local schools. During the year, the 
England and Wales Cricket Board qualiﬁed coaches 
on our staff, together with England ladies’ cricketer, 
Katherine Brunt, took cricket coaching to schools in 
the local area as part of our support for education 
and to promote sports learning as part of the 
National Curriculum.
Strengthening our links with the game of cricket, 
for the sixth year we ran the Drax Cup, a cricket 
competition for teams of girls and boys under 
the age of nine. Some 300 primary schools across 
Yorkshire took part in the knock-out tournament 
organised by the Yorkshire County Cricket Club 
(“Yorkshire CCC”) in conjunction with the Yorkshire 
Cricket Board and the Yorkshire Schools’ Cricket 
Association. This year the winning school was 
Bedale Primary School in North Yorkshire.
Under the “Art in the Community” banner, we held 
our sixth art competition for primary and secondary 
schools. Some 24 schools participated and the 
winners received prizes of top art supplies and their 
schools shared in prize money totalling over £2,800.
Our Summer Art Schools, designed to encourage 
and develop art appreciation as part of our support 
for education and to promote art learning within the 
National Curriculum, entered their ﬁfth year in 2012. 
Children aged 7 to 10 learnt how to design and make 
masks and kites using a variety of materials along 
with t-shirt painting and jigsaw making, while a 
masterclass for 12 to 16 year-olds helped them learn 
more about the skills and techniques involved in 
using watercolour and mixed media.
Visitors to Drax
Thousands of visitors are welcomed to the power 
station every year. The appeal of discovering more 
about how power is produced and the sheer scale of 
the site and its associated activities attracts schools 
and colleges as well as business organisations, and 
local and professional associations. During 2012, 
we played host to some 6,500 visitors.

Overview
Corporate governance
A cornerstone of success…
What good corporate governance means at Drax
 “ The Board believes that good practice should ﬂow throughout 
the Group, which in turn should guide the decisions taken on 
a daily basis. If we achieve this, then we can be sure that we are 
taking the right actions for the beneﬁt of all our stakeholders.”
Charles Berry  
Chairman
Chairman’s letter
I am pleased to present the Group’s Corporate governance report for 2012 on behalf of our Board. This report is intended to 
provide you with a clear and meaningful explanation of what governance means to us and how it guides our decision making. 
Good governance at all levels is taken seriously within the Group and it is the Board that sets the tone and takes the lead. 
Good governance should be second nature to everyone within the Group as they go about their day-to-day business and is not 
simply a set of policies and processes. The Board believes that good practice should ﬂow throughout the Group, which in turn 
should guide the decisions taken on a daily basis. If we achieve this, then we can be sure that we are taking the right actions for 
the beneﬁt of all our stakeholders.
It is important that we continue to develop our board structures, processes and procedures to ensure that our governance 
remains relevant and focused on improving our business and driving our strategic priorities. As in previous years, during 2012, 
we continued to strengthen our internal control and risk management processes to ensure that they remain effective and are 
embedded in business operations across the Group.
I believe the drive for transparent reporting has continued to improve business conduct in recent years. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council emphasises that organisations should actively consider the make 
up and diversity of their boards. We have an established policy which ensures that gender diversity is one of the factors taken 
into account when considering appointments to the Board and other senior roles.
I am pleased to report that the Board has reviewed the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and we comply 
with it and we intend to continue to observe it, to ensure ongoing good governance is maintained. A more detailed report on 
our corporate governance arrangements is set out on the following pages.

(the “Articles”) and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 2006). This is a summary only and 
the relevant provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further information is required.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code

How the Board functions 
The Board has seven scheduled meetings each year, and arranges additional meetings if the need arises. There are also three 
scheduled business updates for the Board by telephone conference call, which are constituted as Board meetings held by 
telephone if required to address matters for formal decisions. In addition, the Board meets at least annually to consider 
strategy. In October 2012, the Board also met specifically to consider and approve proposals for the issue and placing of 
shares and for entering into financing arrangements to support the Company’s planned investments. 
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its decision and formal terms of reference for its committees 
which are available to view on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. The Board determines: the Group’s strategy; 
the Group’s appetite for risk; the internal control and risk management policies; the Business Plan and principal performance 
indicators; acquisitions and disposals and other transactions outside delegated limits; material changes to accounting policies 
or practices; significant financial decisions; capital structure and dividend policy; shareholder communications; prosecution, 
defence or settlement of material litigation; Group remuneration policy; the terms of reference and membership of Board 
Committees; and the Board structure, composition and succession. Matters which are not specifically reserved to the Board 
and its committees under their terms of reference, or to shareholders in General Meeting, are delegated to the Chief Executive 
or otherwise delegated in accordance with a schedule of delegated authorities approved by the Board. 
The Board receives regular reports on performance against the Business Plan and periodic business reports from senior 
management. Directors are briefed on matters to be discussed at meetings by papers distributed in advance of Board and 
committee meetings. 
The Board has adopted a policy whereby directors may, in the furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. During 2012, no director sought independent professional advice pursuant to the policy. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters, ensuring good information flows 
within the Board, its committees and senior management, and ensuring that Board processes are complied with. He is also 
responsible for compliance with the Companies Act, the Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure and Transparency Rules. In his role 
as Director of Corporate Affairs, he is also responsible for advising the Board on legal matters and has responsibility for the 
Company Secretarial, Environmental, External Communications, Group Legal, Human Resources, and Regulatory and Policy 
functions, and for the management of the Group’s internal control and risk management framework and processes. 
The Articles give the directors power to approve conflicts of interest. The Board has adopted a procedure that has operated 
effectively by which situations giving rise to potential conflicts of interest are identified to the Board, considered for 
authorisation and recorded. The Articles also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in group companies without restriction 
(e.g. so as to appoint a director to the board of a group company without this counting as a conflict requiring authorisation). 
Each director has the benefit of a deed of indemnity from the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
liabilities incurred, in either case arising out of the bona fide discharge by the director of his or her duties. The Company has 
also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Overview
Selection, appointment, review and re-election 
The Articles provide that one-third of directors, not including directors appointed by the Board, (rounded down to the nearest 
whole number) shall retire by rotation each year but are eligible to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders and that 
directors shall not serve longer than the third Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) following their election without being 
re-elected by shareholders.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company 
will continue to propose all directors for annual re-election. Accordingly each of Charles Berry, Tim Cobbold, Peter Emery, 
David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan, Paul Taylor, Dorothy Thompson and Tony Thorne will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for re�election.  
Tim Barker will retire at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM and will not seek re-election. 
The Articles require that, following appointment to the Board, directors submit themselves for election by shareholders 
at the first AGM following their appointment. Melanie Gee has been appointed to the Board after the last AGM and, therefore, 
will retire and offer herself for election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
The evaluation of the Board described below concluded that the directors offering themselves for election or re-election 
(in line with the provisions contained in the Articles) continue to demonstrate commitment, management and industry 
expertise in their particular role and perform effectively. 
The election or re-election of each director is recommended by the Board. Details of the service contracts for the executive 
directors and letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are set out in a table on page 69. 
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will be appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the 
Board being satisfied as to the director’s performance and commitment, and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate AGM, 
may be renewed by mutual agreement. However, it is the Board’s policy not to extend the aggregate period of service of 
any independent non�executive director beyond nine years and, any proposal made to extend a non-executive director’s 
aggregate period of office beyond six years is the subject of a rigorous review. Such reviews in cases where a director remains 
in office after six years, will be conducted annually, as part of the evaluation of the Board. 
The Board is satisfied that all the directors are able to devote sufficient time to their duties as directors.  
Performance reviews and directors’ development 
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the Group. For each of the previous five years the Board has conducted 
a review of its effectiveness and that of its committees with the assistance of external facilitation. In 2012, the performance 
review was undertaken internally, led by the Chairman and facilitated by the Company Secretary. The review concluded that 
the Board, its individual directors and its committees continued to be effective. There were no significant areas of concern. 
The review did, however, identify areas in which processes could be improved to enhance the Board’s effectiveness in 
monitoring performance as the Group implements its biomass transformation plans which will increase the scope and 
complexity of the Group’s operations. In particular: 
–� enhanced reporting on major capital projects, including those in the US, will be incorporated into regular Board reporting; 
–� specific measures were identified to assist directors in maintaining appropriate knowledge and understanding of 
commodity market conditions in which the Group operates and to enable them to assess the risks inherent in trading 
activities; and 
–� there is a continuing need to keep the Group’s Bribery Act compliance processes under review in the light of the expansion 
of jurisdictions in which the business will be operating. 
During the year, the Chairman held a meeting with the non-executive directors in the absence of the executive directors, 
and the Senior Independent Director held a meeting with the non-executive directors without the Chairman being present, 
as required by provision A.4.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board is committed to the development of all employees and directors and has reviewed and will periodically continue to 
review each individual director’s development requirements and make appropriate arrangements to address them. All new 
directors receive an induction, including being provided with information about the Group and their responsibilities, meetings 
with key managers and visits to the Group’s sites. In addition, each non-executive director visits operational sites and meets 
with senior management to be briefed on the Group’s business at least annually, and specific Board training days are 
arranged, where appropriate, involving presentations on relevant topics.

 Notes:  
(1)� The Executive Committee is a committee through which the Chief Executive discharges her duties in respect of the day-to-day management of the Group. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Executive Committee. 
(2)�Melanie Gee was appointed a member of each of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committee upon being appointed as a director of the Company on 1 January 2013. 
(3)�Philip Hudson is the Company Secretary. 
Details of the work of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are given in the respective reports of those 
Committees. The terms of reference for these Committees are reviewed annually by each Committee and then by the Board. 
The terms of reference of each Committee are available on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
Directors’ interests, indemnity arrangements and other significant agreements 
Other than a deed of indemnity between each director, the Company and each of its subsidiaries in respect of claims made 
and personal liability incurred as a result of the bona fide discharge of the directors’ responsibilities, a service contract 
between the executive directors and a Group company, or as noted in the Remuneration Committee report, no director 
had a material interest at any time during the year in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings.  
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office 
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-executive director. None of the non-executive directors who has 
served during the year had any material business or other relationship with the Group, and there were no other matters that 
were likely to affect their independence of character and judgement. The Board therefore considers all of the non-executive 
directors to be independent.

 Notes: 
(1)  This includes both the time spent on the Board of Drax Group plc and also the effective predecessor companies Drax Group Limited and Drax Power Limited, up to 31 December 2012. 
(2)  In addition to the Board meetings identified above, there have also been three meetings held by telephone to discuss various matters and one meeting held to specifically approve funding arrangements 
including the placing of shares, and one meeting to consider strategy. There was full attendance at each of these meetings.
Under the terms of his letter of appointment, the Chairman is expected to commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to fulfil 
his role. 
Under the non-executive’s letters of appointment, the time commitment each is expected to give in respect of membership 
of the Board, is 12 to 15 full days a year. That includes attendance at Board meetings, the AGM, one annual Board strategy 
day and at least one site visit per year. In addition, they are expected to devote appropriate preparation time ahead of each 
meeting. The time commitment expected in respect of their membership of committees of the Board, notably the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees, is an additional three to four full days a year in each case.  
Internal control 
Details of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management are contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties 
section together with the Directors’ responsibilities statement in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board places considerable importance on communication with shareholders and is proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences and evaluating systematically the economic, social, environmental and ethical matters that 
may influence or affect the interests of shareholders. A number of formal communication channels are used to account to 
shareholders for the performance of the Group, which include the Annual report and accounts, AGMs and periodic reports 
to the London Stock Exchange. Presentations given at appropriate intervals to representatives of the investor community 
are available to all shareholders to download from the Group’s website (www.draxgroup.plc.uk). Less formal processes include 
contacts with institutional shareholders by the Chairman and other directors. 
The Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open relationship with the Group’s major shareholders and communicates 
directly with them, offering the opportunity to meet in order that he can understand their views on the Group, be it corporate 
governance issues or any other points they might wish to raise. 
The Board also reviews and discusses the investor feedback from post-results investor meetings conducted by the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director in the UK, Europe and the USA. These took place following both the preliminary and half 
year results announcements in 2012. Makinson Cowell Limited, an independent capital markets consultancy firm, is engaged 
by the Group to advise and assist in relation to communications with shareholders.

(1)� As at last TR1 notification made. 
As part of the share placing on 29 October 2012, Invesco plc subscribed for 10.7 million shares at a price of 520 pence per share. 
Invesco plc has not had cause to issue a further TR1 notification to the Company since that detailed above and therefore the 
10.7 million shares are not included in the totals contained in the table above. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
At the AGM held on 18 April 2012, shareholders resolved to authorise the Company to make market purchases of up to 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital. At the forthcoming AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew this authority. Details are 
contained in the notice of the AGM. 
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 2012 and the Company held no Treasury shares during 2012. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Articles. The Articles may only be changed 
by the shareholders by special resolution. 
Variation of rights 
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent 
of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an 
extraordinary resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate General 
Meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued 
shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares held as Treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the 
creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. 
Transfer of shares 
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form 
or in any other form acceptable to the directors and may be under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by 
or on behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor 
shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in the register. All transfers 
of shares which are in uncertificated form may be effected by means of the CREST system. 
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it:  
a) is in respect of only one class of share; and  
b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other 
evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the 
instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do).

Drax Group plc
Annual report and

Corporate governance 
The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason 
therefore, refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being fully paid shares) provided that, where any such shares are 
admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent 
dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to register 
an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. 
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send within two months after the date on which the letter 
of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company, to the allottee or transferee, notice of the refusal. 
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, 
for a transfer of shares to take place. 
The Articles provide that directors must give reasons for any refusal to register a transfer of shares in accordance with the 
Companies Act. 
Shares in uncertificated form 
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be held in uncertificated form and title to such shares may be transferred 
by means of a relevant system or that shares of any class should cease to be held and transferred. Subject to the provisions 
of the Companies Act, the CREST Regulations and every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or order for the time 
being in force concerning companies and affecting the Company. The provisions of the Articles shall not apply to shares of 
any class which are in uncertificated form to the extent that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding of shares of that 
class in uncertificated form, the transfer of title to shares of that class by means of a relevant system or any provision of the 
CREST Regulations. 
Voting 
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached by, or in accordance with, the 
Articles to any class of shares, on a show of hands every member who is present in person at a General Meeting shall have one 
vote and, on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is 
the holder. It has been the Company’s practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General 
Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings. 
Where shares are held by trustees/nominees in respect of the Group’s employee share plans and the voting rights attached 
to such shares are not directly exercisable by the employees, it is the Company’s practice that such rights are not exercised 
by the relevant trustee/nominee. 
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the Company, to exercise 
all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a General Meeting or class meeting. A member may 
appoint more than one proxy in relation to a General Meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A member that is a corporation may appoint 
one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a General Meeting or class meetings as a corporate representative. 
Deadlines for exercising voting rights 
Votes are exercisable at a General Meeting of the Company in respect of which the business being voted upon is being heard. 
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. The Articles 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the 
meeting or adjourned meeting. 
Restrictions on voting 
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her to vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to 
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she has been served with a notice after failing to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act.

of control of the Group following a takeover bid. 
Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditor 
So far as each person who is a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, 
being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is unaware. 
Having made enquiries of fellow directors, each director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director 
to ascertain any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This information 
is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.  
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act, a resolution is to be proposed at the AGM for the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group. A resolution will also be proposed authorising the directors to determine the 
auditor’s remuneration. The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, the auditor’s effectiveness and 
relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Further details on the work 
of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 59 to 61.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.  
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
–� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
–� make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
–� state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and 
–� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: 
–� properly select and apply accounting policies; 
–� present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;  
–� provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
–� make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
–� the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
–� the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
By order of the Board.

Overview
Audit Committee report 
 
Membership and process 
Throughout 2012, the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) consisted of David Lindsell (as Chairman), Tim Barker (Senior 
Independent Director), Tim Cobbold and Tony Thorne all of whom are independent non-executive directors.  
The Board is satisfied that the membership of the Committee meets the requirement for recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee met on four occasions in 2012 and the members’ attendance record is set out on page 53. The Chairman of 
the Committee reports the Committee’s deliberations to the following Board meeting and the minutes of each meeting of the 
Committee are circulated to all members of the Board. 
Role 
The Committee assists the Board to fulfil its oversight responsibilities. Its primary functions are to: 
–� monitor the integrity of the financial statements and other information provided to shareholders; 
–� review significant financial reporting issues and judgements contained in the financial statements; 
–� review the systems of internal control and risk management; 
–� maintain an appropriate relationship with the Group’s external auditor and review the effectiveness and objectivity of the 
external audit process; and  
–� monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit function (which is provided by Grant Thornton UK LLP), review 
the internal audit plan, all internal audit reports and review and monitor management’s responses to the findings and 
recommendations of the internal audit function. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board. The terms of 
reference are available on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the internal and 
external auditor are normally invited by the Chairman of the Committee to attend meetings of the Committee. In undertaking 
its duties, the Committee has access to the services of the Finance Director and the Company Secretary and their resources, 
as well as access to external professional advice. 
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in accordance with an agreed annual work plan of which the main 
features were: 
–� at meetings in February and July 2012, the Committee reviewed the Group’s Preliminary results announcement and 
Annual report and accounts, and the Half year results announcement and Half year report respectively. On each occasion, 
the Committee received reports from management and the external auditor on the application of accounting policies on 
significant estimates and judgements made in preparing the financial statements, and on the methods used to account 
for any significant or unusual transactions. The summary of the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
and our principal accounting policies, all of which have been considered by the Committee, are set out in Note 3 to the 
accounts. In respect of all such matters, the external auditor concurred with the judgements made by management and the 
Committee was satisfied that the accounting policies were applied appropriately and the estimates and judgements made 
were appropriate. In addition, the Committee also satisfied itself of the independence and objectivity of the external auditor 
on the basis set out below under the Independence of the external audit section of the report;  
–� at each meeting the Committee received reports from the internal audit function on the progress of their programme 
for the year, reviewed new internal audit reports and monitored progress with the implementation of internal control 
recommendations. The Committee continues to focus on specifically identified strategic risk areas, as well as ensuring 
“During 2012, the Committee continued to focus on speciﬁcally 
identiﬁed strategic risk areas, whilst ensuring the provision 
of a core compliance assurance service offers comfort 
to stakeholders that effective controls are in place.”

the provision of a core compliance assurance service. No significant weaknesses were identified in any of the internal audit 
reports although certain improvements in processes and procedures were made as a result of reviews;  
–� in November 2012, the Committee reviewed the structure and resources of the finance team and treasury function 
processes and controls; 
–� the Committee reviews the operation of the Company’s risk management system, encompassing operational as well as 
financial controls. At meetings in April and November 2012, the Committee reviewed the Company’s risk register and in 
February and November 2012, it undertook a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls. The Committee 
was satisfied that appropriate frameworks and controls were well embedded into the business and that the system of 
internal controls was effective; 
–� in April 2012, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the management letter covering the external auditor’s findings 
in respect of the prior financial year and also reviewed the performance of the external auditor at the February 2012 
meeting; 
–� during 2012, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) conducted a further phase on the review of effectiveness of controls 
applicable to Drax Power Limited’s commodity trading activities. In November 2012, the results of this further phase were 
presented to the Committee. The report did not identify any significant weaknesses in the controls in place although certain 
improvements in processes and procedures are to be implemented as a result of the reviews;  
–� during the year, the Committee met twice in the absence of management with each of the external and internal auditor. 
No matters of concern were drawn to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. The Committee’s understanding 
with both the external and internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters occasioning 
them material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention via the Chairman of the Committee. 
Nothing was subject to this procedure in the course of the year; and  
–� the Committee has reviewed the content of the Annual report and accounts and advised the Board that, in its view, taken 
as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Independence of the external audit 
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy, in accordance with which, the Committee annually reviews the quality 
and cost effectiveness of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. The Auditor 
Independence Policy can be found on the Company’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk 
The provisions of the Policy include: 
–� seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in its professional judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from it an 
account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff;  
–� a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct non-audit work under which: 
–� the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain categories of work, including those where they may be required to 
audit their own work or make management decisions, or where the auditor would act in an advocacy role for the Group;  
–� there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditor to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to 
financial limits;  
–� all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work are reported to the next meeting of the Committee;  
–� the balance between the fees paid to the external auditor for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee; 
and  
–� a policy on the employment by the Group of former employees of the external auditor, the essence of which is to require 
a period of two years to elapse between the cessation of an individual’s association with the auditor and appointment to 
any financial reporting oversight role within the Group. 
The Committee receives reports from the external auditor on its own processes and procedures to ensure its independence 
and objectivity and to ensure compliance with the relevant standards. 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in Note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 97. The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for 
the Group audit every five years and the current audit partner, Carl Hughes, has been in place for four years. 
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice of external auditor.

Overview
Internal audit 
Grant Thornton UK LLP undertakes the Group’s internal audit function. The Committee periodically reviews whether the 
internal audit function is likely to be more effective or efficient if provided internally. In view of the nature and scope of the 
Group’s business and its management structure, the Committee considers that it continues to be more effective and efficient 
for core internal audit functions to be undertaken by an external service provider, augmented as appropriate by additional 
reviews that require specialist expertise. 
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding the internal audit programme and reviews undertaken. 
Recommendations are made to management for process improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit 
reports reviewed by the Committee during 2012 included: Group payroll and PAYE; Drax Power Limited key financial controls 
on revenue and financial reporting and on treasury and expenditure; VAT and international trade; ROC accreditation; fuel – 
covering coal and biomass procurement and logistics; IT key controls and strategy; Know Your Customer and Bribery Act 
Compliance; Haven Power Limited key financial controls and physical security. 
External auditor 
Deloitte LLP was appointed auditor of the Group in 2005 and has been reappointed at each subsequent Annual General 
Meeting. It previously acted as auditor to the Drax group of companies prior to the listing of the Company in December 2005. 
Any decision to open the external audit to tender is taken on the recommendation of the Audit Committee based on the 
results of the performance review described below. 
Having reviewed its performance during the year and satisfied itself of its continuing independence and objectivity within 
the context of applicable regulatory requirements and professional standards, the Committee has invited the Board to 
recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor at the forthcoming AGM and a resolution to that effect appears 
in the notice of the AGM. 
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal 
and external auditor. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 18 February 2013.

Nominations Committee report 
 
Throughout 2012, the Nominations Committee (the “Committee”) consisted of Charles Berry (as Chairman), Tim Barker 
(Senior Independent Director), Tim Cobbold, David Lindsell and Tony Thorne all of whom are independent non-executive 
directors. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The principal duties of the Committee are to keep under review the structure, size and composition of the Board (including 
the skills, knowledge and experience required by it), to consider succession planning for the directors and other senior 
managers, to identify and nominate candidates to fill vacancies among the directors and to review the time required 
from non-executive directors.  
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board. They are available 
on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
The Committee met on three occasions in 2012, and the members’ attendance record is set out on page 53. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee’s proceedings to the following Board meeting and, subject to 
redaction in the event that they include personal information, the minutes of each meeting of the Committee are circulated 
to all members of the Board. 
During 2012, the Company enhanced its succession planning and career development processes. The Committee considered 
the revised processes and reviewed the succession plan in relation to senior management roles. The succession plan was 
considered to be appropriate taking into account the size and management structure of the Group.  
During the course of the year, the Committee also reviewed the composition of the Board and concluded that it was an 
appropriate time to appoint an additional non-executive director.  
The Committee engaged The Zygos Partnership to conduct a search and selection process. (The Zygos Partnership has no 
other connection with the Company other than in relation to previous engagements on search and selection assignments). 
The Committee was presented with a list of candidates from which a short list was identified. Following consideration and 
interviews with a number of excellent candidates, the Committee recommended to the Board that Melanie Gee be appointed as 
a non-executive director. Her appointment became effective on 1 January 2013 and she will retire and offer herself for election 
by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 24 April 2013. Melanie’s biography appears on page 48. 
It is the Board’s policy to ensure that the proportion of women on the Board is one of the considerations for Board and senior 
management appointments. That policy is implemented as part of the recruitment and selection process. Further details of 
gender diversity in the Group are included in the Corporate and social responsibility section of the Annual report and 
accounts. 
The Company’s Articles provide that directors retire by rotation. However, the UK Corporate Governance Code provides that 
all directors should be subject to annual re-election. The Company adopted the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code on the annual re-election of all directors at the beginning of 2011.  
At the conclusion of the AGM on 24 April 2013, Tim Barker is to retire as a director of the Company and from the committees 
on which he serves.

Overview
The Committee initiated the review of the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and individual directors and the outcome 
is reported in the Corporate governance report on page 51.  
The Board met on 12 February 2013, following the completion of the Board evaluation process, and determined that all of the 
directors who are the subject of annual re-election will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for 
re-election. The evaluation of the Board described on page 51 concluded that the directors offering themselves for re-election 
continue to demonstrate commitment to their particular role and perform effectively. 
At that meeting, the Board also reviewed the membership of the various Board committees and appointed David Lindsell as 
Senior Independent Director and Tony Thorne as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, each to replace Tim Barker upon 
his retirement. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection by 
prior arrangement during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office. They will also be available for inspection 
at the venue, prior to the AGM, details of which are contained in the Notice of Meeting.

Remuneration Committee report 
A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
In last year’s report I said that the Remuneration Committee was supportive of many of the proposals that had been 
suggested by the Government following reviews by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (“BIS”) of narrative 
reporting and executive remuneration. This year BIS has made proposals for further regulations in relation to remuneration 
reporting for years ending after October 2013 and in this year’s report we have adopted many of those proposals. 
We want to build trust in the remuneration process through transparency and accountability, and we have implemented 
further measures to promote greater transparency within the Group. In particular, we have explained decisions on executive 
director remuneration packages to employee representatives in connection with discussions on remuneration generally. 
The Committee’s approach is to enhance the link between both short and long-term performance and executive remuneration 
and also to improve the clarity of reporting. We believe that the best measures of performance are those which are most aligned 
with the interests of our shareholders, both those relating to the Group’s performance and also individual contribution. We are 
now well advanced in a programme to transform our business from predominantly coal-fired generation to predominantly 
renewable biomass. Our performance cannot be measured solely in terms of share price or earnings growth, which is why the 
Committee places considerable importance on performance measures which underpin our longer term strategic development.  
The Committee applies this approach to performance measures in both the annual bonus arrangements and the Bonus Matching 
Plan (“BMP”) for executive directors and senior management. These therefore include both operational and strategic measures 
to align remuneration more closely with key strategic goals specific to Drax, in particular the development of a much more 
sustainable business with reduced reliance on coal, a greater focus on biomass, including upstream development, and increased 
retail sales. The BMP also retains a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measure to ensure more direct alignment of executive 
reward with the returns to shareholders.  
There is a further introductory point to make. Since the Company listed in 2005, its business has been predominantly 
a coal-fired power generation business located at the Drax site. In determining executive directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee has been conscious that we have been less broadly based than many other businesses of a comparable market 
value. This has been particularly relevant in relation to the positioning of executive directors’ base salaries. The acquisition 
and growth of Haven Power, the Group’s retail business, has added to the breadth of the business. As the biomass programme 
develops, as explained fully in the reports by the Chairman and the Chief Executive, we will become a more international 
and more complex business. In order to attract and retain the senior executives who will be most involved in this strategic 
development it will be necessary to take these factors into account. Accordingly, during 2013, the Committee intends to 
review the positioning of executive directors’ remuneration in the light of these changes. 
Context to the Committee’s decisions 
2012 has been a very important year in the development of the Group. The Government has provided clarity on the regulatory 
framework to support power generation from renewable biomass. We were therefore able to build on the work of previous 
years to deliver solid foundations for the Group’s future as a major renewable power generator. We made excellent progress 
with very encouraging results in our biomass research and development and we secured committed financing for our strategic 
capital investment from our investors and lenders. We also made excellent progress in the strategic growth of our retail 
business. It was also a year of strong operational and financial performance across the business.  
The Committee is satisfied that remuneration incentives are compatible with the Group’s risk policies and systems, including 
those relating to environmental, social and governance risks. 
“We believe that the best measures of performance are those 
most aligned with the interests of our shareholders. These include 
both operational and strategic measures, in particular the 
development of a much more sustainable business.”

Overview
Key Committee decisions in the year 
Each year the Committee agrees an annual work schedule. The regular scheduled matters considered by the Committee 
in 2012 were: 
–� review of the performance of the Group by reference to the 2011 Balanced Corporate Scorecard (“Scorecard”), 
including the application of the discretionary factor;  
–� agree the measures and weightings of the 2012 Scorecard;  
–� 2011 annual bonus awards to executive directors and senior managers by reference to the Scorecard and individual 
performance against personal objectives;  
–� agreeing personal objectives for executive directors and senior managers for 2012;  
–� review of base salary and overall remuneration packages for executive directors and senior managers;  
–� review of the Chairman’s remuneration;  
–� granting of awards under executive and all employee share plans;  
–� consideration of vesting of awards under executive share plans;  
–� the 2011 Remuneration Report; and  
–� review of advisers and the fees paid to them. 
At various stages throughout the year the Committee considered the consultation on executive remuneration by BIS, and 
has actively participated in the consultation. The Committee considered the Group’s own remuneration policy and practices 
in that context. It concluded that the structure and level of executive remuneration in the Group continued to be appropriate. 
As noted in the introduction to this report, the Committee intends to review the positioning of executive directors’ 
remuneration in the light of the development of the Group’s biomass transformation. The Committee has sought to 
develop its reporting in line with developing best practice.  
The Committee also considered the provision of pension benefits in the Group as a whole. It agreed that additional steps 
should be taken to make employees aware of the likely level of retirement benefits and encourage additional contributions. 
This may require additional contributions by the Group dependent upon the terms applicable to the relevant schemes. 
 
Policy report 
Introduction 
This report covers the reporting period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 and provides details of the remuneration 
policy for the Group. This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee based on the regulations proposed 
by BIS. The regulations will apply to all UK companies listed on a major stock exchange with financial years ending on or after 
October 2013.  
Remuneration policy 
During the year, the Committee reviewed its terms of reference to ensure that they remain sufficiently flexible and appropriate 
to meet the different requirements necessary to attract, reward and retain senior managers in all Group companies.  
The objectives of the remuneration policy are:  
–� to enable the Group to recruit, retain and motivate the people needed to achieve its business objectives; 
–� to strengthen teamwork by enabling all employees to share in the success of the business;  
–� to ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests; and 
–� to develop an approach which emphasises total reward. 
 
 
66
Drax Group plc
Annual report and 
accounts 2012
Remuneration Committee report 
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: 
–� pay market rates of total remuneration; 
–� adopt different pay and benefit structures for different operating entities in the Group as appropriate for each entity’s 
markets, workforce and location; 
–� ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward; 
–� award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of 
strategic objectives and personal performance; and 
–� ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan targets including the achievement 
of strategic objectives. 
The role of the Committee  
The principles set out above are put into effect through the Committee’s principal duties, which are to: 
–� determine and recommend for approval by the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive and other executive directors and the senior managers; 
–� approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the Group in respect 
of executive directors and senior managers and approve the total annual payments made under such schemes; 
–� review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders. For any such plans, determine 
each year whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to executive 
directors and senior managers and the performance targets to be used; 
–� determine the pension arrangements for executive directors and senior managers; 
–� ensure that contractual terms on termination of the employment of any executive directors or senior manager, and any 
payments made, are fair to the individual, and the Group, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss 
is fully recognised; 
–� within the terms of the agreed policy determine the individual total remuneration packages of the executive directors 
and senior managers including bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards; 
–� review and note annually the remuneration trends across the Group; and 
–� oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group. 
Throughout 2012, the Remuneration Committee comprised Tim Barker, Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the 
Committee, Charles Berry, Chairman of the Company, Tim Cobbold, David Lindsell and Tony Thorne, all of whom are 
independent non-executive directors. The Company Secretary acted as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of the Committee except when her own remuneration is being discussed. 
The Committee met on three occasions during the year and its members’ attendance record is set out on page 53.

Base salary  
To provide a 
market 
competitive base 
salary to attract 
and retain 
executives. 
Base salaries of executive directors are 
reviewed each year with any changes 
taking effect from 1 April. The review 
takes into account individual 
performance and market comparisons, 
recognising that there is no close listed 
comparator to Drax Group plc.  
Salary information is derived, inter alia, 
from two groups of companies:  
(i)�Utilities and selected other industrial 
companies; 
(ii)�Non-financial companies with 
comparable market capitalisation. 
Filters are also applied to exclude 
companies from those groups which 
are less close comparators to Drax 
Group plc in terms of size and 
international presence. 
There are no 
planned changes 
to the current 
approach, 
although the 
Committee does 
intend to review 
the positioning 
of executive 
director salaries 
in the light of 
the changes to 
the business. 
The Committee agreed that with effect from 
1 April 2012 base annual salary for each of the 
executive directors should be increased by 
3.5% to: 
–� Chief Executive – £527,850  
–� Finance Director – £358,938 
–� Production Director – £295,596  
–� Retail and Trading Director – £248,400 
Annual bonus  
Award of annual 
bonuses linked to 
personal 
performance and 
to the 
achievement of 
the annual 
Business Plan 
targets including 
strategic 
objectives. 
The Committee determines Group 
performance measures using a 
Scorecard (see page 76) for which the 
Board sets challenging performance 
targets as part of the Business Plan 
approval process.  
Each element of the Scorecard has a 
low, target and stretch measure and is 
given a percentage weighting. No score 
is attributed if performance is below the 
low measure. Maximum score is 
attributed to the stretch measure.  
Bonuses are calculated as a percentage 
of base salary.

(i.e. +/–25%) to reflect overall performance 
and unexpected developments that are not 
directly included in the Scorecard, leading 
to an overall percentage score. 
Individual performance 
The Board determines personal objectives 
for each executive director. The Committee 
assesses performance and applies an 
individual performance multiplier of between 
zero and 1.5. 
Bonus Awards 
To determine the actual bonus awards, the 
target bonus is then multiplied by the Group 
performance score and the personal score, 
subject to a cap of 2x target bonus.

Maximum award: 1.5 x annual bonus for 
prior year. 
Performance measures:  
50%: Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
over three years relative to FTSE51–150. 
50%: Average outcome from Scorecard 
measures over a three year period. The 
averaging calculation is capped at twice the 
target level, although the annual results on 
which the three year calculation will be made 
are not, for this purpose, so capped. 
Pension 
To provide a 
complete and 
competitive 
reward package. 
Executive directors are entitled to 
non-contributory membership of the 
Group’s defined contribution pension 
plan. The employer’s contribution 
for executive directors is 20% of 
base salary.  
Alternatively, at their option, executive 
directors may either have contributions 
of the same amounts made to their 
personal pension schemes or cash in 
lieu of pension at the stated rate and 
subject to normal statutory deductions; 
or a combination of pension 
contributions up to £50,000 per annum 
with the remainder as cash in lieu 
of pension.  
Benefits are reviewed each year with 
any changes taking effect from 1 April. 
There are no 
planned changes 
to the current 
approach. 
These benefits are not based on individual or 
Group performance in any year. 
Other benefits 
 
Executive directors also receive other 
benefits namely the provision of a car 
allowance, life assurance (x4 salary), 
private medical cover, relocation 
expenses and second base expenses 
where appropriate.

Overview
 
Remuneration scenarios 
The composition and value of the executive directors’ remuneration packages at below threshold, target and outperformance 
scenarios under the Drax Group remuneration policy are set out in the charts below. 
 
Notes: 
1) Annual bonus threshold is assumed at 25% of maximum, target at 50% of maximum and outperformance at 100% of maximum bonus.  
2) The BMP award threshold is assumed at 15% of maximum award and outperformance 100% of maximum, with target representing the average of the two.  
3) The award of conditional shares under the BMP is based on the individual’s prior year annual bonus and therefore it is assumed that corresponding threshold, 
target and maximum bonus is earned for calculating threshold, target and maximum BMP award under each scenario. 
Service contracts 
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
prior notice except that the contracts of Peter Emery and Paul Taylor are terminable by them providing six months’ notice 
to the Company. 
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements other than the Chief Executive’s, Drax has the right to make a 
payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued 
to the executive director during the contractual notice period. 
The following table shows for each person who was a director of the Company at 18 February 2013 or who served as a director 
of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2012, the commencement date and term of the service 
agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice periods.

Remuneration Committee report 
External appointments 
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies 
and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group. The policy is that an 
executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees 
payable in respect of the appointment.  
Dorothy Thompson is a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc and received £53,750 in fees for that appointment 
during 2012. 
Tony Quinlan is a non-executive member of the Port of London Authority board and received £22,344 in fees for that 
appointment during 2012. 
Peter Emery is a non-executive director of NG Bailey Limited and received £12,000 in fees for that appointment during 2012. 
Non-executive directors 
The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services. They do not receive any pension 
or benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans. 
The Chairman’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is 
determined by the Chairman and the executive directors. These are determined in the light of: 
–� fees the chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed companies selected on the same basis as for executive 
directors; 
–� the responsibilities and time commitment; and 
–� the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience. 
Chairman 
The Chairman’s fees are £220,000 per annum. 
Other non-executive directors 
The fees for non-executive directors are: 
Basic fee 
£52,500 per annum
Senior Independent Director (to include chair of a committee other than the Audit Committee)  
£10,000 per annum
Audit Committee Chairmanship  
£10,000 per annum
Termination payment 
No service agreement includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination. Any 
compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances. 
Share plans 
All employee share plans 
The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE”) and a Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), both of which are 
approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis. The executive directors may participate 
in each plan upon the same terms as other employees. The plans are the main vehicles for aligning staff remuneration with 
TSR performance.

Overview
SAYE 
The SAYE plan provides for the grant of options (which, at the Committee’s discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 
20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan) linked to a savings contract which 
pays interest at a statutory rate. The plan was operated in 2006 and again in 2010, 2011 and 2012, so that (subject to the 
statutory upper aggregate limit of £250 per month on an individual’s savings under all SAYE plans) a participating employee 
could choose to save for either or both periods of three or five years. 
In each year of operation, options have been granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price 
(determined in accordance with the plan rules) resulting in option prices of: 
2006 – 636.00 pence per share 
2010 – 310.50 pence per share 
2011 – 321.00 pence per share 
2012 – 410.00 pence per share 
Options may be exercised upon successful completion of the three or five year savings contract to which they are linked. 
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in the Audited Information section of 
this report. 
On 12 February 2013, the Committee agreed that invitations to the SAYE be made again in 2013, following the preliminary 
results announcement. The 20% discount to the market price is applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE 
contracts over three and five years and contribute in total no more than £250 per month. 
SIP 
In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the 
following elements: 
–� award Free Shares (up to £3,000 in value); 
–� allow the purchase of Partnership Shares (up to £1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary); 
–� allocate free Matching Shares (in a maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share); and 
–� allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares. 
The table below details how the SIP has been operated between 2006 and 2009: 
 
2006 
2007 
2008 
2009 
SIP Free Share Award(1) 
Participants received 
£2,000 worth of shares 
Participants received £2,500 worth of shares 
in each year. 
Participants received 
£1,000 worth of shares.
Partnership Share Award Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of £1,500 (subject to an 
overriding maximum of 10% of salary) in each year. 
Matching Share Award(1) Partnership Shares matched on a one-for-one basis in each year. 
Note: 
(1) The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares. 
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of 
the employee. Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax 
liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years. The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect 
of the shares held in trust. 
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in the Audited Information section 
of this report. 
The SIP has not operated since 2009.

Remuneration Committee report 
Provision of shares for share plans – dilution 
All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace 
through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten 
year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Group’s discretionary share plans (e.g. Bonus 
Matching Plan). 
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% 
of the shares in issue at the date of this report. 
Share ownership guidelines 
The Group has share ownership guidelines for senior executives participating in its performance share plans. They are 100% 
and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior management BMP participants, respectively. 
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net 
(that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions) shares received until the applicable guideline is reached. 
Other matters 
Wider employee population  
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the 
Group. The pay increase in 2012 for staff covered by collective bargaining arrangements was determined by a 33 months 
agreement with increases on 1 January 2011 and 2012 at RPI plus 0.3%. The increase was subject to a cap of 4.9%, which 
was therefore the level of the general pay increase on 1 January 2012. The agreement continued until 31 December 2012. 
Following joint negotiations, a two-year pay offer has been made to all employees within the collective bargaining unit. 
The pay offer, which covers the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014, is based on another “RPI plus” formula. 
The average pensionable pay of an executive director is eight and a half times the average of pensionable pay for employees 
within the collective bargaining unit. 
Views taken from the employee population 
In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, the Group discussed executive remuneration policy 
and provided details of the process by which the Committee established executive remuneration packages. The information 
provided included details of the benchmarking of executive director remuneration as well as information benchmarking the 
packages of employees in the collective bargaining unit with those elsewhere in the industry. 
Shareholder engagement  
The Company holds regular meetings with its largest shareholders, and the Committee takes into account any views or 
representations of shareholders relating to executive remuneration. During 2012 shareholders did not raise any matters 
of concern with the Company with regard to executive remuneration.

Pay for performance at Drax Group 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the current executive remuneration policy and the supporting reward structure 
provide clear alignment with the performance of Drax Group. To maintain this relationship, the Remuneration Committee 
periodically reviews the business priorities and the environment in which the Group operates. 
Value of £100 invested 
The following graph shows how the value of £100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2007 has changed and compares 
that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 
indices. These indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Company’s shareholders may judge 
their relative returns given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices. 
The graph reflects the TSR (determined according to usual market practice) for the Company and each of the indices referred 
to on a cumulative basis over the period from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2012.

Overview
Following this process, and based on the relative weightings and scores as set out in the table, the Committee assessed the 
corporate score for 2012 at 1.43. The Committee considered that there were certain elements of the Scorecard where above 
target performance was attributable to factors outside the control of management. In particular, the underlying earnings per 
share score was positively affected by lower tax and financing costs than anticipated. This was the result of reductions in the 
corporation tax rate and delayed refinancing reflecting the Government’s delay in announcing its decision on the review of 
support levels for renewable energy. There were, however, other factors where the Committee felt that the Scorecard result 
did not adequately represent management performance. These were mainly in relation to achievement of regulatory and 
strategic objectives which provide the platform for the development of the biomass transformation. On balance, the 
Committee felt that the numerical calculation of the Scorecard reflected a fair assessment of performance, and therefore 
decided not to exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score.  
The Board determines personal performance objectives for each executive director. The Committee assesses performance 
against these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between zero and 1.5. To determine the actual 
bonus awarded to each executive director, the target bonus is multiplied by the corporate score and by the personal score, 
subject to a cap of twice the target bonus. 
For bonus awards for 2012, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of 
base salary respectively. Their maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively. 75% of any bonus award is paid in cash 
and 25% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a 
“good leaver” before the shares vest.

Overview
Bonus Matching Plan outcome 
Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan 
The Group operates the BMP as a long-term performance share plan. Awards under the BMP have been made in 2009, 2010, 
2011 and 2012. 
Executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the 
amount of the executive’s annual bonus for the prior year. No payment is made for the shares. However, vesting is subject to 
service and performance conditions. 
In respect of existing awards, one-third of awards granted to those members of senior management who are not members 
of the Executive Committee will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the 
Group. Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance (i.e. two-thirds) of the awards granted to 
other members of senior management will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed 
by the Group and subject to achievement of performance conditions determined by the Committee and described below. 
The TSR condition 
50% of such part of any award that is subject to performance conditions shall vest subject to a condition relating to the 
Company’s TSR over the three year period measured from the start of the financial year in which an award is granted relative 
to the TSR over the same period of the companies comprising the FTSE51−150 (the Comparator Group). TSR is the return 
received by a Drax shareholder through appreciation in the share price, plus dividends assumed to be reinvested in Drax shares. 
The TSR condition provides for vesting as follows:

Notes:  
(1) Subject normally to continuing service up to the third anniversary. 
The Scorecard condition 
Starting with awards made in 2011, the 50% of the BMP award subject to performance conditions will vest by reference 
to the Group’s performance against the average outcome from the Scorecard over the three year performance period 
(the Scorecard award). 
The Scorecard award will vest by reference to the average of the outputs of the Scorecard for each of the three years 
reported on during the performance period, commencing at the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made. 
The averaging calculation is capped at twice the target level, although the annual result on which the three year calculation 
will be made is not, for this purpose, so capped. 
The Scorecard award will vest at the end of the three year performance period as follows: 
Average Scorecard outcome 
% of Scorecard Award vesting
<1 
0%
1  
15%(1)
1.5  
100%(1)
Notes:  
(1) Straight-line vesting between 15% and 100% for average result between 1 and 1.5. 
In addition, at the end of the three year performance period the Committee will agree each of the annual results going into 
the average Scorecard calculation and has the discretion to adjust the final outcome based on events over the period to 
ensure an outcome that is consistent with the underlying progression of the business. In exercising its discretion the 
Committee will pay particular regard to progress against the strategic objectives incorporated in the Scorecard, particularly 
the unit conversion to biomass generation, securing the biomass fuel supply, construction and operational readiness of the 
US asset investment and the continued development of the Haven Power retail business.

Overview
Group – Independent auditor’s report 
 
 
To the members of Drax Group plc 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise 
the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, 
the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 33. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
–� give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
–� have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
–� have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
–� certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
–� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
–� the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ report in relation to going concern;  
–� the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
–� certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 
and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Overview
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
 
 
1. General information 
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and 
its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. The address 
of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, 
United Kingdom. The operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 3 to the Company’s separate financial 
statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements. The principal activities of the Group are the generation 
and sale of electricity and by-products of the electricity generation process at Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, 
and the sale of electricity to business customers by Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”). 
2. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU 
IAS Regulations. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as explained in Operational and financial performance 
on page 29, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at 
fair value.  
Change in accounting policy 
In 2012 the Group changed its accounting policy for the measurement of ROC assets generated by the burning of biomass. 
As a result of the change, ROC assets are now measured in accordance with IAS 20: “Accounting for government grants 
and disclosure of government assistance”, at fair value. The Group previously valued ROCs based on the attributable, 
incremental cost of generating ROCs over the cost of coal. 
The change in accounting policy results in recognition that more accurately reflects the substance of generation of ROC 
assets during the business cycle particularly as more biomass is burned and ROC income earned. Accordingly, the Group 
considers that this will result in more relevant presentation as we implement our biomass transformation plans. 
Retrospective application of the change in accounting policy has not had a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group in either the current or prior period and as such corresponding amounts have not been restated as a result 
of this change. 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In 2012, several amended standards and interpretations became effective. These are IFRS 7 (amended) “Disclosures – 
transfers of financial assets”, IFRS 1 (amended) “Severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters” 
and IAS 12 (amended) “Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets”. The adoption of these standards and interpretations 
has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have 
not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending 
endorsement by the EU): 
–� IFRS 1 (amended) “Government loans” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
–� IFRS 7 (amended) “Disclosures: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities” – effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
–� IFRS 9 “Financial instruments – Classification and measurement” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2015.  
–� IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
–� IFRS 11 “Joint arrangements” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
–� IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
–� IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Basis of preparation (continued) 
–� IAS 1 (amended) “Presentation of financial statements – other comprehensive income” – effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2012. 
–� IAS 19 (revised) “Employee benefits” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
–� IAS 27 (revised) “Separate financial statements” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
–� IAS 28 (revised) “Investments in associates and joint ventures” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. 
–� IAS 32 (amended) “Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities” – effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2014. 
–� Annual improvements to IFRS 2009–2011 cycle (various standards) – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. 
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of adoption of IFRS 9 and intends to adopt the standard no later than the accounting 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to endorsement by the EU. 
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group. 
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
(A) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by 
the Company made up to the reporting date each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
(B) Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge of 
the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The critical accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 
Property, plant and equipment – Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices 
prevailing at each balance sheet date. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment 
where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value 
of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future 
cash flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is 
therefore subjective. 
Impairment – The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting 
policy stated in note 3 (E). The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use 
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (see note 10). 
Pensions – The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet 
date. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, expected returns on scheme 
assets, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.  
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions 
utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice 
of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.

Overview
Taxation – In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure 
for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation 
with advisers.  
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have 
been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will 
be recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams. 
Derivatives – Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair values of 
derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves. Forward price 
curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement 
of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves 
upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not 
generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an 
estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options 
these are valued using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, 
the term of the option and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions 
around future transactions and market movements and are, therefore, subjective. 
ROCs and LECs – ROCs and LECs are stated within the balance sheet at fair value. Inherent to the calculation of this fair value 
is an assumption regarding future sales prices in the market. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the 
valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ. 
(C) Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies. 
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms 
or prevailing market rates as applicable. 
Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the risks 
and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party.  
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated 
as giving rise to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange 
is treated as giving rise to revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by 
the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot 
be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount 
of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid. 
Revenue from the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction 
of trade discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, 
supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are likely to 
be recovered. Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling 
price estimates.  
(D) Segmental reporting 
The business activity of the Group consists of the generation and sale of electricity at Drax Power Station, along with the sale 
of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power. The costs incurred by the US operations have 
been included within the generation segment.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(E) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually or more frequently where there is an indication it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then 
to its other assets. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.  
(F) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and 
removing the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment in value. Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.  
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition (limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station). 
The estimated useful lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently: 
 
Years
Main generating plant and freehold buildings 
up to 35
Other plant and machinery 
3–20
Decommissioning asset 
35
Plant spare parts 
35
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence 
as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance 
sheet date. 
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
(G) Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication 
that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by 
reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset (value in use) or sales value net of expenses. 
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The discount 
rate applied is a pre-tax rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market 
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

Overview
(H) Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present 
value of the expected costs. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash 
flows have built in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included 
in interest payable and similar charges. 
(I) Inventories 
Inventories primarily comprise coal and biomass stocks, together with other fuels and consumables. Coal and biomass stocks 
are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value. Other stocks of fuel and consumables are 
valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. 
(J) ROC and LEC assets 
The Group is able to claim ROCs and LECs from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (“OFGEM”) as a result of burning 
renewable fuels instead of coal. ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and 
measured at fair value based on anticipated sales prices. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC 
and LEC assets generated but not sold. Any reductions in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the period 
incurred. The Group’s revenue recognition policy in respect of ROCs and LECs sold to third parties is set out in 3(C) above. 
(K) CO2 emissions allowances 
The Group recognises its free emissions allowances received under the UK NAP at £nil cost allocated to each financial year 
on a straight line basis. Any additional allowances, in excess of the amount allocated and required for the current financial 
year, purchased in the market are recorded at cost, net of any impairment where required, within non-current intangible 
assets. The Group also recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances. The charge 
to the income statement within fuel costs and the liability is measured based on an estimate of the amounts that will be 
required to satisfy the net obligation, taking into account generation, free allowances allocated under the UK NAP, market 
purchases, sales and forward contracts already in place allocated to the financial year, and the market price at the balance 
sheet date. 
(L) Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered 
more likely than not that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, and is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(M) Pension and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides pensions through an approved industry defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, and 
actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The current service cost of the pension charge is deducted in arriving at operating profit in other operating and administrative 
expenses. The net interest cost of the pension charge is included in finance costs and therefore deducted in arriving at profit 
before tax. The excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets is recognised 
as a liability in the balance sheet. 
For the defined contribution scheme, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due to be paid.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(N) Share-based payments 
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the relevant 
vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.  
(O) Foreign currencies 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at the 
exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are 
recognised in the income statement. 
Foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using 
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such operations are translated to sterling using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
(P) Financial instruments 
Debt instruments 
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the 
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through 
the income statement over the life of the instrument.  
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.  
Commodity contracts and treasury derivatives  
Where possible, the Group takes the own use exemption for commodity contracts entered into and held for the purpose of 
the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements. Commodity contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption 
are dealt with as derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through 
the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are treated as effective hedges, or the income statement to the extent the 
contracts are not treated as effective hedges. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception 
of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management 
objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
The Group also uses treasury related derivatives to manage exposure to currency fluctuations. Treasury related derivatives 
are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve to the extent 
that contracts are considered to be effective cash flow hedges, or the income statement to the extent the contracts are not 
effective as hedges.  
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts deferred in equity are released in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity 
of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge 
relationship is less than 12 months. 
Other financial instruments 
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records the difference between the nominal 
value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received, unless merger relief criteria within Companies Act 
(2006) apply, in which case the difference is recorded in retained earnings. 
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.

Overview
Short-term investments – Short-term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions, with a maturity 
of greater than three months at inception. 
Trade and other receivables and payables – Trade and other receivables and payables are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established subsequently where there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term items where the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.  
4. Segmental reporting 
Information reported to the Board and for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions 
is organised into two operating segments. The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 are as follows: 
Generation – The generation of electricity at Drax Power Station. 
Retail – The supply of electricity to retail customers in the small and medium enterprise and industrial and commercial markets. 
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA. Assets and working 
capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management accounts, and 
hence no separate asset disclosure is provided here.

Following the refinancing of our revolving credit facilities in December 2012 (see note 18) the amortisation of deferred finance 
costs in relation to our previous bank facilities has been accelerated. This resulted in a £1.6 million interest charge in the year 
ended 31 December 2012 (2011: £2.6m charge following the refinancing of our previous letter of credit, working capital and 
term loan facilities in July 2011).

7. Taxation 
The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2012 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement. 
Exceptional items 
The 2011 comparative figures include an exceptional tax credit of £197.9 million, following agreement reached with HMRC on 
5 April 2011, resulting in the resolution of the Eurobond tax position and certain other smaller legacy tax matters. The 2011 
income statement therefore includes a current tax credit of £149.5 million and a deferred tax credit of £48.4 million.  
Changes in the rate of corporation tax 
Following the announcement of the 2012 Budget, the Finance Act 2012 (the “Act”) was enacted by Parliament in July 2012. 
The Act confirmed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% from April 2012, and from 24% to 23% from 
April 2013, both of which were enacted during the year. In addition, in the 2012 Budget, the Government proposed further 
reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 23% to 22% from 1 April 2014, and in the 2012 Autumn Statement announced 
an acceleration of this decrease in corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014. These proposals had not been substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.

9. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. In calculating diluted earnings per share the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year is adjusted, when relevant, to take account of outstanding share 
options in relation to the Group’s Approved Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) and contingently issuable 
shares under the Group’s Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP”) and Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”). The underlying earnings 
per share has been calculated after excluding the after tax impact of marking-to-market derivative contracts which are not 
hedged, and exceptional items. 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below:

Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven cash-generating unit (Haven Power Limited, 
or Haven Power). At 31 December 2012, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value; accordingly 
a sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.

Overview
The recoverable amount of Haven Power was calculated based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions used in 
these calculations are those regarding the discount rates and future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. 
The first five years of cash flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board. Future cash flows have 
been taken in perpetuity, assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan. The pre-tax rate used to 
discount the forecast cash flows from Haven Power is 12% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.  
Carbon assets 
Carbon assets arise upon the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the 
current financial year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties. At 31 December 2012, the Group 
had amounts receivable from five (2011: three) significant counterparties within the generation business, representing 78% 
(2011: 71%) of trade receivables, all of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms. The ageing 
profile, beyond a month, of the Group’s receivables continues to be insignificant. Counterparty risk is discussed in note 19. 
Management does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, does not believe that a 
further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of £4.7 million (2011: £3.0 million). 
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience, and includes £4.6 million in relation to Haven 
Power (2011: £3.0 million).

Refinancing 
As set out in Operational and financial performance, on 20 December 2012 we completed the refinancing of our revolving 
credit facilities which were due to mature in April 2014. This facility was replaced with a larger £400 million revolving credit 
facility which matures in April 2016 and can be used for both letters of credit and working capital purposes. The margin over 
LIBOR on our new facility is 2.25%. In addition to the revolving credit facility, we executed two new committed term loans 
of £100 million each with the Prudential M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and the UK Green Investment Bank. The loans 
have an identical repayment profile, amortising from the date six years after signing with the final repayment eight years after 
signing. At the same time as concluding the financing agreements above, we also executed a commodities trading line, which 
allows trading counterparties to benefit from the security package offered to senior lenders instead of Drax posting collateral 
for certain volumes of trades. The Prudential M&G UK Companies Financing Fund loan of £100 million was fully drawn at the 
year end. 
Analysis of borrowings 
Borrowings at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans and 
the revolving credit facility respectively.

Overview
19. Financial instruments 
The Group issues or holds financial instruments for two purposes: financial instruments relating to the financing and 
management of risks for the Group’s operations; and financial instruments relating to the financing and risks in the Group’s 
debt portfolio. 
The Group’s financial instruments consist of borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise directly from its operations 
and derivative contracts. The Group enters into short-term and medium-term forward contracts for the sale of electricity 
and the purchase of coal, sustainable biomass and CO2 emissions allowances, as well as financial coal contracts to swap 
floating for fixed, or fixed for floating prices on fixed volumes of coal. The Group also enters into interest rate swap 
agreements and forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables generally 
have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate their fair value. The Group’s borrowings 
relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans (2011: revolving credit facility), the carrying amounts of which 
approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments. 
The fair values and maturities of the Group’s derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market and recorded 
in the balance sheet at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 were as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
19. Financial instruments (continued) 
Due to the nature of commodity contracts and the way they are managed, the own use exemption has been applied 
to a limited number of them, including the five year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
–� Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, 
not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet 
date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. 
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial 
liabilities is the current ask price. 
–� Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
–� Embedded derivatives fair value – The Group has also reviewed all contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. 
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic 
characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts. 
All financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, have been grouped into Level 2, 
as defined below, based on the degree to which fair value is observable. 
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: 
Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities; 
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  
The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison 
between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.  
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.  
Risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign 
currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses 
on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance.  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the 
in close co-operation with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, 
sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have 
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so. 
The Group has a policy of making forward power sales with corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances 
when profitable to do so. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in 
order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.  
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different 
maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted 
at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal. All physical biomass 
and domestic coal purchase contracts are currently entered into and held for the purpose of the Group’s own purchase, sale 
or usage requirements and are therefore designated as own use.

Overview
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range 
of domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts 
are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price 
of CO2 emissions allowances.  
Commodity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary 
items at the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance 
sheet date.  
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s: 
–� profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 would increase/decrease by £5.4 million (2011: decrease/increase 
by £7.2 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to financial coal derivatives; and 
–� other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £32.0 million (2011: decrease/increase by £10.5 million) mainly as a result 
of the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power. 
Interest rate risk 
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to 
mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. On refinancing in December 2012 (see note 18), 
the Group repaid its outstanding balance against the revolving credit facility, and drew down £100 million of new term loans. 
No new interest rate swaps have been taken out to the date of the approval of these consolidated financial statements; 
however this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s instruments that are 
exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included in note 18. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.  
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net 
assets for the year ended 31 December 2012 would decrease/increase by £0.2 million (2011: increase/decrease by £0.8 million) 
as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period. 
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass 
purchases in Canadian dollars, US dollars and euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros. As we progress our 
biomass transformation plans, we are entering into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange contracts. Exchange 
rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Foreign currency sensitivity 
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s: 
–� profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 would decrease/increase by £86.5 million (2011: decrease/increase 
by £21.2 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered into 
in relation to biomass purchase (2011: financial coal) contracts; and 
–� other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £1.1 million (2011: decrease/increase by £4.9 million) as a result of 
the changes in the fair value of hedged foreign currency exchange contracts.

Liquidity risk 
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board 
of directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. 
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding 
for business requirements.  
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables 
include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount 
is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Counterparty risk 
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is 
exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or 
fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.  
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. 
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial 
distress or increase the risk profile of the Group. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date,

19. Financial instruments (continued) 
Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £4.7 million (2011: £3.0 million).  
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved at risk management committees. 
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company 
guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased 
credit default swaps. 
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage 
credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the 
maturity profile. 
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of shareholders’ equity excluding the hedge reserve, together with net debt or, when the Group has net cash, shareholders’ 
equity excluding the hedge reserve, less net cash. Net debt/cash comprises borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash 
equivalents in note 16 and short-term investments in note 15. Equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company comprises 
issued capital, capital reserves, retained profits/accumulated losses, excluding the hedge reserve (see Consolidated statement 
of changes in equity). Maintaining an optimal supporting capital structure is one of the Group’s key priorities, and as such, 
our performance is detailed within Operational and financial performance. The capital structure of the Group is as follows:

The provision for reinstatement represents the estimated decommissioning, demolition and site remediation costs at the end 
of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the 
present value of the expected costs. The initial provision and subsequent estimation increases are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment and are being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is 
included in finance costs (note 6). 
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices. The discount rate applied is a risk free rate, reflecting the fact that the 
estimated future cash flows have built in the risks specific to the liability.

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. 
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends. 
Issued under employee share schemes 
On 30 April 2012, a total of 246,017 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of the 
Group’s Bonus Matching Plan granted in 2009. Additionally, on 10 February, 14 September and 24 December 2012 a total of 
1,776 shares, 873 shares and 1,553 shares, respectively, were issued on early exercise of options under the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Plan by three separate individuals whose employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement 
(28 September 2011: 274 shares, one individual). No shares were issued in satisfaction of the Bonus Matching Plan for 
employees whose employment terminated due to retirement during 2012 (1 April 2011: 2,456 shares, one individual). 
Share placing 
As part of the funding for the capital investment required for biomass transformation, on 29 October 2012 the Group placed 
36,474,627 shares, representing 9.9% of the existing issued ordinary share capital at that time. The placing raised gross 
proceeds of £189.7 million. Associated transaction costs of £2.0 million have been deducted directly from equity. 
The placing shares have been credited as fully paid and rank equally in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 
pence each in the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or 
paid in respect of such shares after the date of issue of the placing shares. 
The share placing was achieved through a “cash box” placing arrangement, which is legally structured such that the merger 
relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 apply. Accordingly, the funds raised in excess of the nominal value of the 
shares issued have been treated as distributable within retained reserves rather than credited to the share premium account. 
As a consequence, of the £187.7 million net proceeds raised, share capital increased by £4.3 million with the balance of 
£183.4 million increasing retained profits in the year ended 31 December 2012 (note 26).

Overview
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) 
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership shares in any one tax year. 
Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any Partnership shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with 
the cost of Matching shares borne by the Group. There were no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching share plan 
in 2011, or 2012.

Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP”) 
Between 2006 and 2008 the Group operated the ESIP. Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares were made 
at £nil consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary. Shares 
vested according to whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) matched or outperformed an index (determined in 
accordance with the scheme rules) over three years. The fair value of the 2008, 2007 and 2006 ESIP awards, of £1.2 million, 
£0.9 million and £1.9 million, respectively, have been charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
corresponding three year vesting periods.  
Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) 
The BMP was introduced in 2009 to replace the ESIP. Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related 
shares are made at £nil consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their 
annual bonus. A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an 
index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years. From 2011, a proportion of the shares vesting will be 
conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2012, 2011 and 2010 
BMP awards, of £5.8 million, £5.5 million and £3.0 million, respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) 
In April 2012, 2011 and 2010, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for 
employees to acquire shares at a price of 410 pence (2011: 321 pence, 2010: 310.5 pence), representing a discount of 20% to 
the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three 
or five year savings contracts. The fair value of the 2012, 2011 and 2010 options granted in connection with the SAYE Plan, of 
£0.2 million, £0.2 million and £0.6 million, respectively, is being charged to the income statement over the life of the relevant 
contracts. The only other previous grant under the SAYE Plan, in July 2006 at an exercise price of 636 pence, resulted in a 
fair value of £0.5 million being charged to the income statement over the life of the respective contracts.

Fair value of share-based payment awards 
The fair value of share-based payment awards was determined as follows: 
SIP – based on price paid at award dates; 
ESIP and BMP – Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels 
of vesting; and 
SAYE – Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to- 
market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts 
held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit 
or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. Further information in relation to the Group’s 
accounting for financial instruments is included in notes 3 and 19.

30. Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group (“DPG”) of the Electricity Supply 
Pension Scheme (“ESPS”). This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through 
being existing members of another part of the ESPS. The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme. 
Defined benefit scheme 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPG ESPS was 31 March 2010. This has been updated as at 31 December 2012 
to reflect relevant changes in assumptions. The principal assumptions were as follows: 
As at 31 December

4.1
Expected return on plan assets 
5.6 
5.2
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. 
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2012 at age 60 will live on average for a further 26 years (2011: 26 years) 
after retirement if they are male, and for a further 28 years (2011: 28 years) after retirement if they are female. 
Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners (currently aged 45) is assumed to be 27 years 
and 30 years respectively (2011: 27 years and 29 years respectively).

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. 
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical 
markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted 
capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for 
each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme. 
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption, which is determined 
by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the duration of the 
scheme’s liabilities. It is estimated that an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would have the effect of decreasing the net 
liability recognised in the balance sheet by approximately £18 million (2011: £16 million) and a decrease of 0.5% in the discount 
rate would increase the net liability recognised in the balance sheet by £20 million (2011: £19 million).

In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, the Group guarantees the obligations of a number of banks in

contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £77.6 million (2011: 
£126.1 million, under the previous £310 million revolving credit facility). 
Community Energy Saving Programme 
Drax Power Limited was obliged under the Electricity and Gas (Community Energy Saving Programme) Order 2009 (“CESP”) 
to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain during the period 
1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012 (the “Obligation Period”). Drax’s obligation was to deliver 895,138 lifetime tonnes of CO2 
savings. Drax entered into an agreement with a third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged to deliver Drax’s 
CESP obligation, for a total cost of £17 million. The third party has failed to comply fully with its obligation under the agreement, 
leaving a significant shortfall against Drax’s CESP obligation. Drax will be considering legal proceedings for breach of contract 
against the third party. 
Drax has entered into further agreements with additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable. 
Whilst the precise volume of measures achieved through these additional steps remains subject to confirmation by the Office 
of Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), which administers CESP, Drax has fallen significantly short of its CESP obligation at 
the end of the Obligation Period. 
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (“the Authority”) is the enforcement authority in relation to CESP. It is for Ofgem to 
decide whether to open an investigation into any party that has failed to meet its obligation. Subject to the findings of such an 
investigation, Ofgem will produce a statement of case or decide that there is no case to answer. In the case of the former, a 
recommendation to an enforcement committee of the Authority will be made on enforcement action to impose. The Authority 
has wide powers of enforcement, including issuing a penalty or other means of enforcement. Ofgem has also indicated that 
a settlement committee of the Authority will be established to consider proposals made by obligated parties to settle 
investigations. At this stage, it is not possible to predict accurately what, if any, enforcement action may be imposed.  
In the absence of any communication on enforcement from Ofgem prior to their report on compliance to the Secretary of 
State in April 2013, it is not practicable to measure reliably the financial impact, if any. Accordingly no provision has been 
recognised within the consolidated financial statements in relation to this matter.

Overview
Company – Independent auditor’s report  
To the members of Drax Group plc 
We have audited the Company financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the 
Company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 7. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Overview
Notes to the Company balance sheet 
 
 
 
 
1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below, and have been consistently applied to both years presented. 
(A) Cash flow statement 
The cash flows of the Group are included in the Consolidated cash flow statement of Drax Group plc, whose accounts are 
publicly available. Accordingly, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 “Cash flow statements” 
not to publish a cash flow statement. 
(B) Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption granted by paragraph 3(b) of FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” 
not to disclose transactions with other group companies. 
(C) Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment. 
(D) Financial instruments 
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records the difference between the nominal 
value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received, unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 
(2006) apply, in which case the difference is recorded in retained earnings. 
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.  
Short-term investments – Short-term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions, with a maturity 
of greater than three months at inception. 
2. Profit and loss account 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss 
account for the year. The Company’s profit and loss account was approved by the Board on 18 February 2013. Drax Group plc 
reported a profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 of £99.6 million, or a loss of £0.6 million before dividends received 
from other group companies (2011: a profit for the year of £125.1 million, or a profit of £0.6 million before dividends). 
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and 
a proportion was re-charged to the Company. The amount re-charged during the year was £558,000 (2011: £593,000). 
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 was £20,000 
(2011: £20,000).

Fixed asset investments relate entirely to subsidiary undertakings of the Company. 
The capital contribution consists of two elements: a £4,578,000 (2011: £100,000) capital injection into a new subsidiary, 
and £4,760,000 (2011: £3,570,000) in relation to the share-based payment charge associated with the Savings-Related 
Share Option Plan and Bonus Matching Plan schemes, which arises because the beneficiaries of the scheme are employed 
by subsidiary companies. For more information see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. 
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends. 
Issued under employee share schemes 
On 30 April 2012, a total of 246,017 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of the 
Group’s Bonus Matching Plan granted in 2009. Additionally, on 10 February, 14 September and 24 December 2012 a total of 
1,776 shares, 873 shares and 1,553 shares respectively were issued on early exercise of options under the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Plan by three separate individuals whose employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement 
(28 September 2011: 274 shares, one individual). No shares were issued in satisfaction of the Bonus Matching Plan for 
employees whose employment terminated due to retirement. (1 April 2011: 2,456 shares, one individual) 
Share placing 
As part of the funding for the capital investment required for biomass transformation, on 29 October 2012 the Group placed 
36,474,627 shares, representing 9.9% of the existing issued ordinary share capital at that time. The placing raised gross 
proceeds of £189.7 million. Associated transaction costs of £2.0 million have been deducted directly from equity. 
The placing shares have been credited as fully paid and rank equally in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 
pence each in the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or 
paid in respect of such shares after the date of issue of the placing shares. 
The share placing was achieved through a “cash box” placing arrangement, which is legally structured such that the merger 
relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 apply. Accordingly, the funds raised in excess of the nominal value of the 
shares issued have been treated as distributable within retained reserves rather than credited to the share premium account. 
As a consequence, of the £187.7 million net proceeds raised, share capital increased by £4.3 million with the balance of 
£183.4 million increasing retained profits in the year ended 31 December 2012 (note 5).

million) payable on or before 17 May 2013. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2012. 
7. Contingent liabilities 
The Company has provided unsecured guarantees to third parties in respect of contracts held by a subsidiary company. 
The guarantees have been issued for £nil consideration and the Company has not charged the subsidiary for the guarantees.  
The Company has granted a charge over the assets of certain of its subsidiaries, in respect of the Group’s debt (detailed in 
note 18 to the consolidated financial statements), which is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the subsidiary 
undertakings of the Company that are party to the security arrangement. The Company itself is not a guarantor of the 
Group’s debt.

Overview
Beneficial owners and “information rights” 
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA provider or other nominee company) you may, if you 
wish, receive information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. In order for this to happen, you must contact 
the third party registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications by beneficial owners of shares where the 
shares are held by third party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder and not to Drax or Equiniti. 
ShareGift 
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing 
to dispose charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no 
capital gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. 
Further information can be obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org. 
Share frauds (“Boiler room scams”) 
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls 
or correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or 
message in the correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. 
Some Drax Group plc shareholders have received such communications in the latter part of 2012. 
At the time of this report, the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such 
as those experienced by our shareholders are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals. The approaches can 
be very persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice or any offers to purchase your shares: 
–� make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation; 
–� check that they are properly authorised by the Financial Services Authority (”FSA”) before getting involved. You can check 
at www.fsa.gov.uk/register; 
–� the FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK 
investors and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date 
and any other appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; 
–� do not provide any personal details to callers e.g. bank details, full address; 
–� do not send your share certificates to anyone; and  
–� report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 (cost of calls may vary) or visiting 
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/consumerinformation. 
The FSA advises that, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The FSA also recommend ten steps to help protect 
shareholders and consumers from scams such as this. More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found 
on the FSA website (details above).

Ancillary services 
 
Availability 
 
Average achieved price 
Services provided to National Grid used 
for balancing supply and demand or 
maintaining secure electricity supplies 
within acceptable limits. They are described 
in Connection Condition 8 of the Grid Code. 
 
Average percentage of time the units were 
available for generation. 
 
Power revenues divided by volume of net 
sales (includes imbalance charges). 
 
 
 
Average capture price 
 
Balancing Mechanism 
 
Baseload 
Revenue derived from bilateral contracts 
divided by volume of net merchant sales. 
 
The sub-set of the market through which 
the System Operator can call upon 
additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation/consumption, through 
market participants’ bids and offers, in 
order to balance the system minute 
by minute. 
 
Running 24 hours per day, seven days per 
week remaining permanently synchronised 
to the system. 
 
 
 
Bilateral contracts 
 
Company 
 
Dark green spread 
Contracts with counterparties and power 
exchange trades. 
 
Drax Group plc. 
 
The difference between the price available 
in the market for sales of electricity and 
the marginal cost of production (being the 
cost of coal and other fuels including CO2 
emissions allowances). 
 
 
 
EBITDA 
 
EU ETS 
 
Forced outage 
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, gains/(losses) on 
disposal of property, plant and equipment 
and unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative 
contracts. 
 
The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is a 
mechanism introduced across the EU to 
reduce emissions of CO2; the scheme is 
capable of being extended to cover all 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
Any reduction in plant availability excluding 
planned outages. 
 
Feed-in Tariff with Contracts 
for Difference (FiT CfD) 
 
Forced outage rate 
 
Frequency response service 
A long-term contract set at a fixed level 
where variable payments are made to 
ensure the generator receives an agreed 
tariff (assuming they sell their electricity 
at the market price). The Feed-in Tariff 
payment would be made in addition to 
the generator’s revenues from selling 
electricity in the market. The FiT CfD 
can be a two-way mechanism that has 
the potential to see generators return 
money to consumers if electricity prices 
are higher than the agreed tariff. 
 
The capacity which is not available due to 
forced outages or restrictions expressed as 
a percentage of the maximum theoretical 
capacity, less planned outage capacity. 
 
Services purchased by National Grid to 
maintain system frequency. 
 
 
 
Grid charges 
 
Group 
Includes transmission network use of 
system charges (“TNUoS”), balancing 
services use of system charges (“BSUoS”) 
and distribution use of system charges
