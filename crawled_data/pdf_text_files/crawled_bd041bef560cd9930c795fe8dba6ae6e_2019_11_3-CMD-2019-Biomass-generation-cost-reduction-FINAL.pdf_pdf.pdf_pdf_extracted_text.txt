Why We Have Focused on the US Gulf
Leveraging abundant fibre resources and dry bulk infrastructure in US Southeast
19 November 2019
US Southeast – key fibre basket
–
Vast resources of sustainable forestry
–
Carbon stocks increased >90% since 1950
–
Well established commercial forestry industry and infrastructure
–
Structural decline in incumbent users of low value fibre
–
Opportunity for pellet producers
Stable commercial and regulatory environment
>35% of the 
landmass and 
25% of global 
industrial wood 
production
Pellet industry 
less than 3% of 
annual harvest
Forest growing 
annually since 
1950s
Protected by 
statutes, regulation 
and certification
Best practices in 
forest management
and sustainability

－ Driving excellence throughout operations, trading and optimisation
－ Focused improvement initiatives: safety, cost and commercial efficiency, integrated operational planning
－ Port: working in partnership to structure contracts post-2027 
－ Storage: additional on-dock storage under negotiation – avoiding inland store requirement
－ Rail routes: increase paths, rotations per rail set – increased tonnage
－ Combustion: on-site processing to reduce unburned material, fouling and heat transfer optimisation 
－ Process modifications: reburning unburned biomass material
－ Turbine upgrades: barrel turbine
－ Agricultural residues: maximising against technical limit, improving flexibility
－ Biomass trading capability: optimisation and risk management
－ Targeting locations: where fibre demand is in decline
