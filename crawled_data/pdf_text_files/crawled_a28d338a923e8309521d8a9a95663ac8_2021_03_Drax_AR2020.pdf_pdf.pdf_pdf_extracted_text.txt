 We calculate Adjusted financial performance measures, which are specific to Drax and exclude income statement volatility arising from derivative financial 
instruments and the impact of items we consider to be exceptional, to provide additional information about the Group’s performance. Adjusted financial 
performance measures are described more fully on page 153, with a reconciliation to their statutory equivalents in note 2.7 to the consolidated financial statements 
on page 170. Throughout this document we distinguish between Adjusted financial performance measures and Total financial performance measures, which  
are calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). On 15 December 2020, the Group announced the sale of its portfolio  
of CCGT assets to VPI Holdings in a deal worth up to £193 million (see page 21), which subsequently completed on 31 January 2021. As a result of this transaction,  
the results of the CCGT portfolio for 2019 and 2020 have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. References to 
financial performance measures throughout this annual report refer to continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. Further details, and a full reconciliation  
of continuing, discontinued and total financial performance measures is included in note 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Market context
Supporting the nation’s  
energy needs, tackling climate 
change and promoting the 
UK’s socio-economic growth 
and global leadership ambition 
through negative emissions 
Why is Drax 
important in 
the market? 
Net zero
UK and Globally
The UK continued to position itself  
as a world leader in decarbonisation.  
The Prime Minister’s 10-point plan and 
Energy White Paper included low-
carbon technologies such as offshore 
wind and carbon capture and storage. 
Despite COP26 being postponed  
by a year, several major economies 
announced, reaffirmed or accelerated 
their net zero commitments. The EU  
set a new 2030 target for emission 
reduction to complement its target  
of carbon neutrality by 2050. South 
Africa, Japan and South Korea 
announced net zero emissions by 2050. 
China announced a carbon emission 
peak before 2030, with carbon 
neutrality by 2060. Joe Biden pledged 
to re-join the Paris Climate Agreement, 
proposing to make US electricity 
production carbon-free by 2035 and 
meet net zero by 2050. 
Bioenergy carbon capture  
and storage (BECCS)
The UK’s Climate Change Committee 
highlighted in December 2020 that 53 
MtCO2 of BECCS would be needed to 
meet net zero. National Grid set out in 
its 2020 Future Energy Scenarios (FES) 
report that BECCS was needed in the 
power industry in every scenario to 
achieve net zero in 2050 and could  
help the UK achieve a carbon negative 
power system as early as 2030. 
The UK Government reaffirmed its 
commitment to Carbon Capture Usage 
and Storage, safeguarding and building 
on its £800 million budget commitment 
in a minimum of two clusters. In that 
context, it announced a call for evidence 
on the role of Greenhouse Gas Removal 
technologies (GGRs) including BECCS. 
This will inform key strategic decisions 
around the development, deliverability 
and cost of different GGRs, as well as  
the Government’s role in addressing 
market barriers, supporting policies  
and frameworks. 
Flexibility and Stability
Intermittent renewable technologies 
such as solar and wind grew in 2020, 
helping decarbonise the power sector. 
However, this growth increased 
challenges for the stability of the UK’s 
electricity grid, caused by generation 
outages and low wind levels. National 
Grid twice issued an “Electricity Margin 
Notice” – a warning that the margin 
between electricity supply and demand 
on the system had tightened to critical 
levels – for the first time since 2016. This 
underscored the need to increase flexible 
Decarbonisation, electrification, 
the role of negative carbon 
emissions and a green recovery 
from Covid-19
2020 was widely expected to be a 
transformative year: the UK would leave 
– and seek a new relationship with –  
the European Union; the re-elected UK 
Government under Boris Johnson would 
implement a new vision and manifesto, 
including the levelling up agenda and 
COP26; and US elections in November 
would offer two very different domestic 
and international visions. But very few 
predicted why 2020 would become  
such a watershed year. The worldwide 
pandemic (Covid-19) fundamentally 
changed the world, with short- and 
long-term socio-economic consequences 
and global impact on health. 
One issue didn’t change, however. 
Climate change, and the focus on a  
green economy and renewable power. 
Rather than the global crisis pushing  
the green agenda into the long grass,  
the general public reconnected with  
the environment during lockdowns,  
and governments saw the economic 
benefits of pushing a green recovery  
with more affordable green technology.

Covid-19 and the Green Bounce Back
Global situation
COP26
COP26 in Glasgow was postponed to 
2021 but offers potential to be a major 
success for the UK both domestically 
and internationally. The UK Government 
will want to showcase innovative 
decarbonisation technologies ahead  
of COP26. This will be an opportunity 
for Drax to continue to explain how it 
can be part of a diverse green energy 
mix to meet net zero with innovative 
advancements technologically 
(through BECCS, CCS and hydrogen) 
and financially through new green 
finance models. 
Biomass Acceptability 
In the US, EU and in the UK, policy 
makers have continued to regulate 
biomass in the context of global and 
domestic efforts to meet net zero.  
In the EU, the European Commission’s 
Green New Deal proposed a new 
biodiversity strategy and re-opening 
key legislation such as the REDII and  
EU ETS. In the UK, the Government 
announced it would begin work on  
a new bioenergy strategy – to be 
published in 2022. In the US, the  
EPA has been actively considering  
the carbon credentials of biomass. 
Energy 
Covid-19’s global economic impact also 
affected the UK power market. In 2020 
alone, the average wholesale power 
price fell 44%, with average electricity 
demand down by 13%. The costs of 
balancing the system rose 51% to 
£293 million whilst the share of 
renewables increased from 28% to 
38.4%, with biomass increasing 8.4% 
and fossil fuel decreasing by 17.4%. 
Green Economic Recovery
It has become increasingly clear that a 
Covid-19 socio-economic recovery in the 
UK will focus on green technologies and 
industries, using private finance to fund 
immediate and future priorities such as 
green infrastructure. This could create 
tens of thousands of jobs around the 
country, such as offshore wind, carbon 
capture and storage, and hydrogen.
The UK Government’s BEIS attitudes 
survey shows that public support for 
biomass continues to rise.
EU Carbon Targets
With the EU’s increased net zero ambition 
and timetable, biomass is likely to play  
a key role in helping the EU to meet its 
ambitious targets. This increased 
ambition will have implications for carbon 
pricing and could result in higher carbon 
prices in the UK even after Brexit. The  
UK announced a UK Emissions Trading 
Scheme (ETS) to replace the EU-ETS from 
1 January 2021. The EU is also examining 
the potential to introduce a carbon border 
adjustment where non-EU countries will 
be required to account for an implied 
carbon price to import goods into the EU.
Drax Impact
Despite Covid-19 challenges, Drax’s global 
supply chain for pellets has remained 
resilient. As in 2020, Drax will continue to 
engage with UK, EU and US policymakers 
on the role of biomass, through the BEIS 
biomass strategy, revision of REDII and 
new US administration. 
In 2021, Drax is positioning itself as one  
of the business leaders for COP26 and 
will look to support the UK Government  
in its efforts to make this a success. 
Drax Impact
Drax can be at the heart of the green 
economic recovery in the North. Scaling 
up BECCS at Drax could support 
thousands of jobs during construction  
at its peak and contribute significantly to 
the local economy, according to a report 
from Vivid Economics, commissioned by 
Drax. Delivering the Zero Carbon Humber 
project could create and support tens of 
thousands of jobs locally and throughout 
the supply chain, according to the report. 
Many businesses will be remembered  
for their actions during the Covid-19 
pandemic. At Drax, we generated good 
returns for shareholders, with a 
sustainable and growing dividend and 
increased share price, whilst “keeping  
the lights on”, avoiding furloughing 
employees and supporting our 
employees, customers and communities. 
generation and technologies, such as 
Drax’s pumped storage and biomass,  
to keep the system stable and balanced. 
Electrification
According to National Grid’s FES report, 
electricity demand could double  
between now and 2050. One of the key 
components of net zero will be the 
substantial increase in the electrification 
of various sectors of the economy, such 
as heat and transportation. With wind 
and solar technologies likely to supply  
the bulk of this generation, flexible 
technologies will play a role in managing 
their integration and constraints. The 
FES report estimates that up to 20 GW  
of hydrogen power and up to 40 GW  
of storage (such as that provided by 
pumped storage hydro) could be required 
to balance the grid in 2050.
Drax Impact
Drax already plays an active role in 
decarbonising the energy system and 
providing stability and flexibility. Our 
strategic focus for a net zero future 
remains increasing pumped storage  
and sustainable biomass self-supply, 
whilst progressing BECCS to be carbon 
negative by 2030. We are also continuing 
to focus on giving our customers control 
of their energy.

Chair’s statement
How are we planning to become  
carbon negative by 2030?
With the right negative emissions framework from  
the UK Government, we aim to become a carbon  
negative company by 2030. We believe BECCS technology 
could have global application in the delivery of negative 
carbon emissions
Introduction 
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a  
zero carbon, lower cost energy future. 
This informs our strategy of building a 
long-term future for sustainable biomass, 
becoming the leading provider of 
electricity system stability in the UK, and 
giving customers control of their energy. 
Since 2012, we have reduced Drax’s 
carbon emissions by over 85%, principally 
reflecting our long-term investment in 
sustainable biomass. During the year we 
made further progress, announcing in 
February 2020 an end to commercial coal 
generation effective in March 2021. In 
January 2021, we completed the sale of 
our gas generation portfolio, further 
reducing our carbon emissions. More 
recently, on 8 February 2021, we 
announced the proposed acquisition of 
Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., which is 
expected to position Drax as the world’s 
leading biomass generation and supply 
business, alongside the continued 
development of Drax’s ambition to 
become carbon negative by 2030.  
The proposed acquisition is subject to 
shareholder approval and certain court 
and regulatory approvals.
There remains more we can do to reduce 
carbon emissions. With the right negative 
emissions framework from the UK 
Government, we aim to achieve our 
ambition to become a carbon negative 
company by 2030 using BECCS 
technology. We believe this technology 
could have global application in the 
delivery of negative carbon emissions. 
Through these activities, we expect to 
play a major role in delivering the UK’s 
legally binding objective to achieve  
net zero carbon emissions by 2050  
and support global efforts to reduce 
carbon emissions. 
Operations, Covid-19 and 
supporting stakeholders 
2020 witnessed the outbreak of  
Covid-19 with unprecedented global 
impact. For Drax, the safety and 
wellbeing of colleagues remained 
paramount. The Board held additional 
meetings, overseeing the Group’s 
response, understanding the impact  
on colleagues, customers, communities  
and other stakeholders. 
As a strategic part of the UK’s critical 
national infrastructure, we recognise  
our responsibility to support the  
country’s response to Covid-19 and our 
stakeholders. We maintained high levels 
of power generation throughout 2020, 
and we did not seek any Covid-19 financial 
support from the UK Government, nor did 
we furlough any employees.
We provided extra support to our 
customers, particularly the small and 
medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that 
were adversely affected. We froze  
energy payments from care homes in 
communities local to Drax and offered 
debt support to customers. We supported 
our communities in the UK and US with 
charitable donations and provided over 
850 free laptops to enable home learning

Throughout the pandemic, we have 
continued to engage with shareholders 
to explain our expectations of the impact 
of Covid-19 on the Group and the Board 
has considered their feedback.
Operationally, our generation portfolio 
performed well. In 2020, the Group  
was the largest source of renewable 
electricity by output in the UK, providing 
11% of the total from its biomass and 
hydro generation assets. We also 
provided the system support services  
and operational flexibility required to  
help maintain grid stability during the 
Covid-19 induced changes to power 
demand. Additionally, we completed two 
major outages on our gas and biomass 
assets, with the latter including a turbine 
upgrade which will help contribute to our 
strategy to reduce the cost of biomass.
Sustainable biomass has a long-term  
role to play in the UK and global energy 
markets, both as a flexible and 
sustainable source of renewable energy, 
and as a means of delivering negative 
carbon emissions. Key to securing this 
long-term role is reducing the cost of 
biomass and growing our supply chain. 
We believe these actions will deliver 
attractive returns to shareholders and 
enable a long-term future for sustainable 
biomass, which could include negative 
carbon emissions via BECCS.
Our Customers business, which supplies 
electricity and gas to businesses in the 
UK, experienced significant challenges 
associated with the impact of Covid-19. 
The SME market suffered most from this 
impact, with lower energy demand and,  
in some cases, an increase in business 
failures. Throughout the year, our  
teams have focused on supporting 
customers as well as working to deliver 
improvements. We continue to monitor 
the situation and assess the options  
for this part of the business.
Results and dividend
Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, including both 
continuing and discontinued operations, 
was £412 million (see page 22 for further 
detail and a reconciliation to relevant 
IFRS measures). This was a small increase 
on 2019 (£410 million), despite the impact 
of Covid-19, which was principally 
associated with the performance of our 
Customers business. We believe this was 
a strong performance within the context 
of a challenging environment.
At the 2020 half year results, we 
confirmed an interim dividend of £27 
million (6.8 pence per share). The Board 
proposes to pay a final dividend in 
respect of 2020 of £41 million, equivalent 
to 10.3 pence per share, making the full 
year 2020 dividend £68 million (17.1 pence 
per share) (2019: £63 million, 15.9 pence 
per share). This represents a 7.5% increase 
on 2019 and is consistent with our policy 
to pay a dividend which is sustainable 
and expected to grow as the strategy 
delivers stable earnings, strong cash 
flows and opportunities for growth.
In determining the continued 
appropriateness of the dividend, the 
Board considered a range of factors. 
These included trading performance, 
current liquidity, the outlook for the  
year in the context of Covid-19, as well  
as the steps being taken to support all 
stakeholders. The Board believes 
payment of the final dividend remains 
consistent with the Group’s commitment 
to all stakeholders.
The Group has a clear capital allocation 
policy which it applied throughout 2020. 
In determining the rate of growth in 
dividends from one year to the next, the 
Board will take account of cash flows,  
the less predictable cash flows from  
the Group’s commodity-linked revenue 
streams and future investment 
opportunities. The latter includes our 
stated intent to invest to expand the 
Group’s biomass supply chain and reduce 
the cost of biomass. If there is a build-up 
of capital, the Board will consider the 
most appropriate mechanism to return 
this to shareholders.
People and values
The Board is committed to building a 
supportive, diverse and inclusive working 
environment where all colleagues feel 
they belong. To underpin this, in 
September we launched a new Diversity 
and Inclusion Policy and approach.
Listening to employees and ensuring  
a two-way dialogue is vital to 
understanding where we are doing  
well and where we can improve. In 2020, 
we asked employees for feedback on our 
values and their experience of working  
at Drax – which informed the evolution  
of our values – an important part of 
engagement as Drax continues to 
develop and change. Will Gardiner, our 
CEO, and I met regularly with the chairs  
of our workforce engagement forums. 
These meetings provided valuable 
ongoing insights and feedback for the 
Board in a period of significant change. 
This helped us to support the business  
in managing the transition to remote 
working and ensuring the safety and 
wellbeing of our workforce. On behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank Will  
During 2020 we supported 
stakeholders in response to 
Covid-19, and maintained high 
levels of power generation 
throughout the year”
and the executive team for their 
leadership during this extraordinary  
year and all of our employees who have 
responded so well to the challenges 
presented in 2020.
Safety is a long-held and central 
commitment of our operational 
philosophy. While the number of incidents 
is low, we need to remain vigilant and 
work to reduce them. We are committed 
to the highest standards and have 
continued our efforts to strengthen  
our approach across the Group. 
Sustainability is at the heart of what  
we do and we believe that achieving  
a positive economic, social and 
environmental impact helps us create 
long-term value. We remain committed  
to promoting the UN Global Compact 
principles on respect for human rights, 
labour rights, the environment and 
anti-corruption.
Board changes
In April 2020, Andy Koss stepped down 
from the Board after four years as an 
Executive Director and 15 years with  
the Group. I would like to thank Andy  
for his valuable contribution to the  
Group in this period.
Conclusion
In 2020 we delivered a strong financial 
and operational performance in the 
context of the very challenging  
environment caused by Covid-19,  
supported our stakeholders and  
continued to pay a sustainable and 
growing dividend in line with our policy. 
At the same time, we continued to make 
progress with our strategic objectives. 
Our biomass strategy is clear; we believe 
it can deliver sustainable long-term  
value to our stakeholders as we realise 
our purpose of enabling a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future and we remain 
focused on this objective.

How has Drax 
performed in 
2020?
We have delivered a robust 
performance, supporting  
our employees, communities 
and customers and made 
good progress in delivering  
on our strategy
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero 
carbon, lower cost energy future. To 
deliver that purpose, our strategy is to 
build a long-term future for sustainable 
biomass, become the leading provider  
of system stability in the UK and give 
customers control of their energy.
Our purpose also drives our commitment 
to the battle against climate change. Since 
2012 we have reduced the Group’s carbon 
emissions by over 85%, we are the UK’s 
largest renewable energy generator by 
output and have an ambition to become  
a carbon negative company by 2030. 
Operationally, 2020 was a successful 
year, as we delivered increases in pellet 
production and increased availability 
across our generation fleet, in spite of the 
challenges we faced due to the Covid-19 
pandemic. Our colleagues have responded 
tremendously to those challenges, with 
operational staff on site at power stations 
and pellet plants working in a safe 
manner, while the rest of our colleagues 
have had to work from home. As a result, 
we have had a limited number of Covid-19 
cases although, sadly, one colleague in 
the US died with the virus.
Strategically, 2020 was a pivotal year  
for the Group. In February 2020 we 
announced an end to commercial coal 
generation, effective in March 2021. In 
January 2021 we completed the sale of 
our gas generation portfolio, which was

reconciliation to relevant IFRS measures.
announced in December 2020. Following 
these actions we believe our carbon 
emissions will be amongst the lowest  
of any European energy company.
As we work towards our purpose we 
continue to develop our options for 
BECCS, which we believe can become  
a world leading, UK-led and exportable 
solution for large-scale carbon negative 
power generation. Subject to the right 
negative emissions framework from the 
UK Government, we expect to be in a 
position to make further investment in 
the development of this option in 2021 
and to advance our ambition to become  
a carbon negative company by 2030.
In February 2021, we were pleased to 
announce the proposed acquisition  
of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. 
(Pinnacle) which we believe will position 
Drax as the world’s leading biomass 
generation and supply business, 
delivering against our strategy to 
increase our self-supply capability, reduce 
our biomass production cost and create  
a long-term future for sustainable 
biomass. Completion of the proposed 
acquisition is subject to shareholder 
consents and the satisfaction of certain 
conditions precedent.
As we advance our strategy, we expect  
to deliver higher quality earnings, reduce 
commodity exposure and create 
opportunities for growth aligned with

In January 2020 we 
announced an end to 
commercial coal generation  
in March 2021 and in January

of our gas generation portfolio. 
This will further reduce the 
Group’s carbon emissions

become carbon neutral by 2050. This 
underpins our continued commitment  
to a sustainable and growing dividend.
Summary of 2020
Adjusted EBITDA, a key financial KPI,  
of £412 million from continuing and 
discontinued operations represents  
a small increase on 2019 (£410 million), 
inclusive of an estimated £60 million 
impact associated with Covid-19, 
principally on our Customers business. 
We believe that this was a strong 
underlying performance which reflects 
increased pellet production, biomass  
cost reduction and renewable power 
generation, offsetting the impact of 
Covid-19 on the Customers business.  
The Total Operating loss for the year  
was £156 million, predominantly 
reflecting asset obsolescence charges 
and provisions for other costs following 
the announcement of the closure of  
coal generation at Drax Power Station.
Our balance sheet is strong with cash 
and total committed facilities of £682 
million at 31 December 2020 and net debt 
of £776 million giving a ratio of 1.9x net 
debt to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing 
and discontinued operations for the full 
year, in line with our long-term target. 
During the year we completed a series  
of financing activities that extend the 
maturity of our debt to 2030 and reduce 
the cost of our debt whilst retaining the 
link between carbon emissions and the 
level of interest paid via a new ESG-linked 
revolving credit facility (RCF). 
In further recognition of the progress  
we have made on ESG performance, in 
December 2020 the CDP awarded Drax 
an A- rating for our CDP climate response 
(2019: C). Separately, we are now a TCFD 
Supporter and we reflect that framework 
in this report.
Safety remains a primary focus. Since 
March 2020 our operational colleagues, 
working at power stations or pellet 
plants, have had to work in new ways to 
protect against outbreaks of Covid-19 on 
site, while maintaining our contribution 
to the integrity of the UK power system.  
I am very pleased with everyone’s efforts 
in this area and that we did not have any 
outbreaks of Covid-19 at our sites in 2020.
In this context, the Total Recordable 
Incident Rate (TRIR), a key scorecard 
measure of safety, was 0.29 (2019: 0.22). 
This was not the level we expect. 
Although there were no major incidents, 
the number of minor reportable injuries 
did increase. We take any increase in the 
number of reportable incidents seriously 
and have implemented processes to 
improve risk assessment, alongside a 
campaign to raise awareness of good 
practice, ensuring the correct personal 
protective equipment is used.
Operational performance
In the US southeast, our Pellet 
Production operations reported Adjusted 
EBITDA of £52 million up 63% (2019: £32 
million). This was a strong performance, 
reflecting increased levels of production, 
improved pellet quality and a continued 
focus on cost reduction.
Pellet production was 1.5 million tonnes 
(Mt), an increase of 7% (2019: 1.4Mt), 
which reflects a strong operational 
performance and good fibre availability 
compared to 2019 when heavy rainfall 
restricted commercial forestry activity.
Pellet quality, as measured by the level  
of fines (larger particle-sized dust) in 
each cargo improved in 2020. Lower 
levels of fines result in biomass that is 
easier and safer to handle throughout  
the supply chain. As such there are safety, 
operational and cost benefits in reducing 
the level of fines and we continue to work 
hard to deliver these improvements.
We remain focused on opportunities to 
deliver savings, across the supply chain, 
as part of our target to reduce the cost  
of biomass to £50/MWh on 5Mt by 2027. 
As a part of this long-term goal we 
previously identified an intermediate 
programme of supply chain 
improvements, efficiencies and 
investments. We believe this will reduce 
the cost of biomass by $35/tonne (£13/
MWh) on our existing portfolio by 2022 
compared to 2018 (programme 
commenced in 2019). In 2020 this 
programme, alongside increased output 
and other incremental operational 
improvements, resulted in an average 
production cost of $153/tonne (2019: 
$161/tonne), a 5% saving year-on-year.
We expect to deliver further savings, as  
a part of this programme, by expanding 
our existing sites (LaSalle, Morehouse 
and Amite) by 0.4Mt. At the end of 2020 
we completed the first phase of these – 
0.1Mt at Morehouse – with the remaining 
capacity of 0.3Mt expected to come on 
stream by 2022. Realising these 
programmes will expand total capacity  
to 1.9Mt, providing economies of scale 
and allowing greater utilisation of 
low-cost residues. 
In February 2020 we announced plans to 
further expand our existing infrastructure 
with the development of three new 
40,000 tonne satellite plants. These sites 
will use lower cost sawmill residues and 
leverage our existing infrastructure in  
the US southeast to produce biomass  
at around 20% below the current cost  
of production. We believe this model 
could provide 0.5Mt per annum of 
additional lower-cost biomass and that 
these projects advance the Group’s  
plans to create a long-term future for 
sustainable biomass, offer returns 
significantly ahead of the Group’s cost  
of capital and attractive payback periods.
In Generation, the portfolio has 
performed strongly, with Adjusted 
EBITDA of £446 million from continuing 
and discontinued operations, an increase 
of 9% compared to 2019 (£408 million). 
The portfolio produced 6% of the UK’s 
electricity between October 2019 and 
September 2020 (the most recent period 
for which data is available) and 11% of the 
UK’s renewable electricity, making Drax 
the largest renewable generator by 
output in 2020. 
This level of renewable generation is  
only possible thanks to a combination  
of portfolio availability and a resilient 
supply chain.
Portfolio availability (calculated based  
on the availability of each generation 
asset weighted by EBITDA contribution) 
was 91% (2019: 88%). Underlying this 
performance is a robust maintenance 
regime. During the year we completed 
major planned outages at Damhead 
Creek and Drax Power Station. The latter 
included the second in a series of 
high-pressure turbine upgrades across 
three biomass units which will deliver 
incremental thermal efficiency 
improvements and lower maintenance 
12 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
CEO’s review continued
costs, reducing the cost of our biomass 
power generation. The final outage on 
the unit which operates under the 
contracts for difference (CfD) scheme  
is scheduled to take place in 2021.
The logistical challenges of these major 
works, in a Covid-19 operating 
environment, are significant. We 
delivered the outages with minimum 
delay thanks to the diligence, skill and 
hard work of our teams and contractors.
Our biomass supply chain performed well 
and to date there has been no material 
impact from Covid-19 or Brexit on our 
supply chain or those of our key suppliers.
Our Scottish hydro operations – 
Cruachan Pumped Storage Power 
Station (Cruachan), and the Lanark  
and Galloway hydro schemes – have 
performed well. These assets provide 
renewable electricity, system support 
services, peak power generation and 
Capacity Market income. Taken together 
with the Daldowie energy from waste 
plant, Adjusted EBITDA was £73 million 
(2019: £71 million).
System support services (Balancing 
Market, ancillary services and portfolio 
optimisation) are an important part of  
the Group’s strategy. They are also critical 
to the safe and reliable operation of the 
power system. Historically, baseload 
thermal power plants provided both 
electricity and a full range of system 
support services. As the UK power 
system decarbonises, intermittent 
renewable generation has progressively 
displaced these assets, creating new 
challenges in balancing the system.
Throughout 2020 our portfolio supported 
the system operator in managing the 
impact of Covid-19 on power demand.  
In the first half of 2020, a reduction in 
demand for electricity required flexible 
generators, like Drax, to turn-down and 
stabilise the system. In the second half  
of 2020, a combination of cold weather, 
lower wind speed and asset availability 
issues led to periods of increased 
demand. At these times, our flexible 
assets were able to increase output to 
help balance the system.
System Support Services and 
Optimisation – our measure of 
performance in the provision of these 
services was gross profit of £118 million,  
a small reduction on 2019 (£120 million), 
which included income from specific 
constraint contracts which were not 
expected to recur in 2020. 
Cruachan, an important source of system 
support, was successful in a tender 
process to procure specific non-
generation services – inertia and reactive 
power. The contract, which commenced 
in July 2020, is worth up to £5 million per 
year and is over a six-year period. This was 
the first tender of its kind and we expect 
the system operator to conduct further 
tenders over the coming years. 
Merchant power prices remain an 
important part of the Group’s earnings, 
but by focusing on flexible and renewable 
generation, the importance of merchant 
power prices has reduced. We have a 
strong forward power sales position in 
place until 2022. Beyond this date, whilst 
an exposure exists, it is largely associated 
with the three biomass units which 
operate under the Renewable Obligation 
Certificate (ROC) scheme. 
In January 2021, following the UK’s  
exit from the European Union, the UK 
introduced a new carbon emissions 
trading scheme to replace the existing 
European scheme to which the UK no 
longer has access. We believe that  
robust carbon pricing is essential for 
decarbonisation and an important 
component of long-term power prices. 
With a growing level of interconnection 
between the UK and continental Europe 
as well as growing ambition in terms of 
EU energy policy we believe that in the 
long-term UK carbon and power prices 
could trend towards European prices.  
We also believe that with greater demand 
for system support services, near-term 
power prices could become more volatile 
– driven by system support service 
requirements rather than commodity 
market fundamentals.
The end of commercial coal operations  
in March 2021, and final closure of the 
generating units in September 2022, is 
expected to result in annual cost savings 
of £30-35 million once complete. We 
believe that this will help to support the 
financial model for long-term biomass 
generation at Drax Power Station when 
the current renewable subsidy schemes 
end in March 2027. An employee 
consultation process was completed  
in 2020. Implementing the changes will 
result in the reduction of 206 roles and 
one-off costs of £34 million. 
Our Customers business reported a loss 
at the Adjusted EBITDA level of £39 
million (2019: £17 million profit). This 
reflects the significant reduction in 
demand caused by Covid-19, the cost 
associated with exiting hedged positions 
as market prices have fallen and the 
increased risk of business failure and bad 
 
We believe our carbon 
emissions will be amongst  
the lowest of any European 
energy company”

debt – principally in the SME market, 
around 30% of monthly billing. Looking 
beyond the impact of Covid-19 we will 
continue to monitor the wider Customer 
portfolio to ensure alignment with the 
Group’s strategy.
Performance in Industrial and 
Commercial markets was stronger with 
the addition to the portfolio of long-dated 
power sales contracts to water utilities, 
providing revenue visibility over the next 
five years. Just as the Generation 
business provides system support 
services, so too can our Industrial and 
Commercial customer portfolio. Over 
time, we expect that this part of the 
Group, through efficiency and demand-
side response, can contribute 
increasingly to the Group’s system 
support services alongside generation. 
We continue to believe this approach  
will support long-term growth. 
The Customers business has a 
differentiated market position – selling 
purely renewable power while helping 
over 2,000 independent renewable 
generators access the market. 
Biomass strategy
Biomass has an important role to play in 
global energy markets as a flexible and 
sustainable source of renewable energy, 
as well as offering the potential to deliver 
negative emissions via BECCS. We believe 
that the key to securing this long-term 
role is to reduce the unit cost of biomass 
and develop greater direct control of the 
supply chain.
The Group is targeting control of 5Mt  
of self-supply capacity by 2027 (currently 
1.6Mt, plus 0.4Mt in development) and 
reduce the cost of biomass to £50/MWh 
by 2027. Through the delivery of these 
strategic objectives Drax aims to create a 
long-term future for sustainable biomass, 
including third-party supply, BECCS and 
merchant biomass generation
The proposed acquisition of Pinnacle 
accelerates the Group’s strategic 
objectives by adding 2.9Mt of biomass 
production capacity from 2022, being a 
combination of capacity available to Drax 
for self-supply and long-term third-party 
supply contacts to counterparties in Asia 
and Europe. In 2019, Pinnacle’s 
production costs were around 20% lower 
than our own.
We intend to deliver further savings 
through the optimisation of existing 
biomass operations, greater utilisation of 
forestry residues, such as sawmill 
residues and the use of other lower cost 
renewable feedstocks. 
The UK’s Climate Change Committee 
(CCC) has set out what is required for  
the country to achieve its legally binding 
objective of being net zero by 2050.  
This includes an important role for BECCS 
to remove carbon from the atmosphere, 
creating negative emissions. BECCS is 
the only large-scale solution for negative 
emissions with renewable electricity  
and system support capabilities.  
Through combining BECCS with its 
existing biomass generation units at  
Drax Power Station, we believe we could 
remove millions of tonnes of carbon each 
year from 2027. In doing so Drax aims  
to become a carbon negative company 
by 2030.
The technology to deliver post-
combustion BECCS exists and is proven 
at scale. In September 2020, Drax 
commenced a trial of one such 
technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries. In addition, we are developing 
innovative technology options, including 
C-Capture, a partnership with Leeds 
University, IP Group and BP, which has 
developed an organic solvent which 
could be used for BECCS. 
Drax Power Station is in the Humber 
region, an area with the highest absolute 
level of carbon emissions in the UK, 
owing to the industry and manufacturing 
located there. This makes the region  
a natural site for large-scale carbon 
capture and storage for energy and 
industry. We continue to work in 
partnership with Equinor, National Grid 
and others as part of the Zero Carbon 
Humber campaign, which we believe  
can bring new investment, new jobs and 
world-leading and exportable negative 
emissions technologies to the UK.
We expect further clarity on the 
regulation and support for BECCS and 
the Humber cluster over the next two 
years and stand ready to develop this 
technology which is necessary in 
allowing the UK to deliver its target  
of a net zero economy by 2050.
We expect global demand for wood 
pellets to increase in the current  
decade, as other countries develop 
decarbonisation programmes that 
recognise the benefits of sustainable 
biomass for generation, opening up new 
sustainable markets. Whilst there is an 
abundance of unprocessed sustainable 
biomass material globally, there remains 
limited capacity to convert these 
materials into energy dense pellets, which 
have a low-carbon footprint and lower 
cost associated with transportation.  
The proposed acquisition of Pinnacle 
supports our biomass self-supply strategy 
which can be used as part of our options 
for merchant generator or BECCS,  
but equally it provides an immediate 
capability to serve the global market  
for biomass, underpinned by long-term 
off-take agreements.
Biomass sustainability
When sustainably sourced, biomass is 
renewable – and sustainably sourced 
biomass is an important part of UK and 
European renewable energy policy.
The legal framework and science which 
underpins this assessment is clear. Carbon 
emitted in the generation of renewable 
electricity is absorbed by and accounted 
for in the growth of forest stock. This is 
based on well-established principles set 
out by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, a UN body, which 
reconfirmed its long-standing position on 
sustainably sourced biomass in 2019. This 
interpretation is reflected in the European 
Union’s second Renewable Energy 
Directive (RED II) and Taxonomy rules, 
which mirror RED II.
The Group provides full disclosure of  
the carbon emissions associated with  
our generation activities as part of our 
annual reporting. We also report the 
carbon emissions associated with our 
biomass supply chain, providing a greater 
level of disclosure than other forms of 
electricity generation that also have 
carbon emissions associated with their 
supply chains. 
The Group’s biomass life cycle carbon 
emissions in 2020 were 109kgCO2e/MWh 
of electricity (2019: 124 kgCO2e/MWh), 
almost half the UK Government’s 
200kgCO2e/MWh of electricity limit  
for biomass.
We maintain a rigorous and robust 
approach to biomass sustainability, 
ensuring the wood fibre used and pellets 
produced are fully compliant with the 
UK’s mandatory standards as well as 
those of the EU. We use low-cost sawmill 
residues and forest residues, which are  
a by-product of commercial forestry 
processes, and thinnings from growing 
forests, which help improve forest  
stocks and forest health. The carbon 
emissions from using sustainably  
sourced biomass to produce electricity 
are balanced by the absorption  
of carbon from growing forests.

CEO’s review continued
In the US southeast, the source for most 
of our biomass, increased demand for 
wood fibre has directly contributed to 
increased growth and protection of 
forests. Inventories have increased by 
over 90% since 1950 as more carbon is 
stored year after year, despite harvests 
also increasing. 
Our forestry commitments are based on 
the latest available science from Forest 
Research, the UK’s principal organisation 
for forest science. Our Responsible 
Sourcing Policy for Woody Biomass aims 
to ensure we only source biomass that 
makes a net positive contribution to 
climate change, protects and enhances 
biodiversity and has a positive social 
impact on local communities.
Our Policy goes beyond compliance, and 
our Independent Advisory Board on 
Sustainable Biomass (IAB), chaired by 
Sir John Beddington, provides guidance 
and independent oversight on the 
sourcing choices we make. The advice 
and scrutiny from the IAB means 
stakeholders can be assured that Drax 
will keep our policies under review and 
that the biomass we use follows the latest 
scientific research and best practice.
Other developments
In our Hydro business we are continuing 
to develop a long-term option for the 
expansion of Cruachan. Its location, 
ability to generate and absorb power from 
the grid, and full range of system support 
services makes it strategically important 
to the management of the UK power 
system and aligned with its future needs.
We are continuing to develop options  
for new gas generation, including four 
small open cycle gas turbine units at  
sites in Wales and eastern England.  
These flexible assets are intended to  
help meet peak demand and provide 
non-generation system support services. 
Any development remains subject to  
the Group’s decarbonisation plans  
and the right price in a future Capacity 
Market auction.
We have taken the decision not to pursue 
the option to develop a new combined 
cycle gas power station at Drax Power 
Station, and continue to assess options 
for the site.
People and values
Sustainability is at the heart of the Group 
and its culture. We believe that achieving 
a positive economic, social and 
environmental impact is key to delivering 
long-term value creation. Drax is a 
signatory to the UN Global Compact 
(UNGC) and we are committed to 
promoting the UNGC principles on 
respect for human rights, labour rights, 
the environment and anti-corruption.
The Board is committed to building a 
supportive, diverse and inclusive working 
environment where all colleagues feel 
they belong. This is underpinned by a new 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy and 
approach. We value the views of our 
employees and have incorporated  
their feedback in the development  
of our values. 2020 saw a significant 
improvement in the level of engagement 
which we measure as a KPI on the 
Group’s corporate scorecard – used  
for our 2020 cash bonus plan and 
determination of vesting under our  
2018 LTIP due to vest in 2021.
The strong performance and positive 
response to Covid-19 across the Group  
is testament to the hard work, diligence 
and spirit of our employees. I am proud  
to have them as colleagues and I thank 
them for their efforts in this most 
challenging of years. 
Outlook
Looking forward, our focus is on 
progressing our strategy: to build a 
long-term future for sustainable biomass; 
to be the leading provider of system 
stability in the UK and to give customers 
control of their energy. Through 
achieving these strategic objectives,  
we expect to deliver tangible financial 
benefits – long-term earnings growth, 
strong cash generation and attractive 
returns for our shareholders.
Our principal focus remains the 
expansion of our biomass supply chain 
and the reduction of cost to provide a 
long-term future for sustainable biomass. 
This includes our ambition to become  
a carbon negative company by 2030 
underpinned by the development of 
BECCS, using technology already proven 
at scale to deliver negative carbon 
emissions. Through our expertise in 
biomass we are leading the way in 
developing this world class technology 
and response to climate change. 
We are making good progress with the 
delivery of our strategy and will build on 
this as we continue to play an important 
role in our markets as well as realising our 
purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future for the UK.

Biomass Sustainability
Sustainable biomass has three 
big benefits: it generates 
renewable electricity, supports 
forest growth and provides a 
route to negative emissions. 
Biomass Sustainability
Sustainably sourced biomass for use in 
the generation of renewable electricity  
is an important and well-established part 
of UK and European renewable energy 
policy. In 2019 bioenergy was the leading 
form of renewable energy in Europe, 
providing twice the amount of energy  
of wind and solar combined. The status  
of biomass as a renewable material when 
sustainably sourced is based on well-
established scientific principles reflected 
in the European Union’s second 
renewable energy directive and 
Taxonomy rules.
Sustainable biomass sourcing practices 
are at the heart of Drax’s activities and 
have underpinned our transformation 
from the UK’s largest coal-fired power 
station, to its fourth largest power 
generator operating a portfolio of flexible, 
renewable and low-carbon assets, with an 
ambition to become carbon negative by 
2030. In addition, based on its utilisation 
of sustainably sourced biomass, Drax 
Power Station is also the UK’s largest 
source of renewable electricity by output. 
We believe that sustainable practices are 
important to the activities of the Group  
in the UK and North America, are integral 
to good corporate governance and 
critical to the long-term sustainability  
of our business model.
Drax sources biomass from established, 
responsibly managed working forests 
primarily in the US, Canada and Europe. 
Commercial forests are generally 
managed for sawlogs, which are sold  
into the construction and manufacturing 
markets. Sawlogs command a financial 
premium which make them uneconomic 
for use in making renewable electricity 
from sustainably sourced biomass. 
However, the associated material and 
residues, such as sawmill residues and 
forest thinnings are of use in other lower 
cost markets such as biomass and fibre 
board. This process is fully compliant  
with UK and European legislation.
Drax is leading standards on biomass 
sustainability and we are committed  
to continuing to raise those standards,  
so that our sourcing policies evolve as  
the science develops. Our Responsible 
Sourcing Policy for Woody Biomass is  
in line with the recommended sourcing 
practices set out by Forest Research – the 
UK’s principal organisation for forestry 
and tree-related science. We have also set 
up an Independent Advisory Board (IAB) 
led by the UK government’s former Chief 
Scientific Adviser Sir John Beddington. 
The IAB provides independent advice to 
Drax in all areas of its biomass sourcing. 
In 2020 the IAB reviewed our Responsible 
Sourcing Policy and confirmed that it 
reflects the recommendations made  
by Forest Research. We apply these 
standards to our own activities and  
those of our third-party suppliers.
We are committed to full transparency 
and provide an overview of our sourcing 
practices and publish reports for each 
area we source biomass material from.  
At the same time, we are taking action to 
reduce emissions across our supply chain, 
for example through investment in rail 
infrastructure and by partnering with 
organisations like the Smart Green 
Shipping Alliance.
Carbon accounting
Carbon accounting and reporting of 
sustainable biomass is an important  
area of disclosure. Sustainably sourced 
biomass is considered carbon neutral 
under UK and European legislation, 
underpinned by well-established 
principles set out by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, as carbon emitted in the 
generation of renewable electricity  
is consumed and accounted for in  
the growth of new forest stock. 
Drax provides full disclosure of the 
biogenic carbon emissions associated 
with its generation activities. We also 
report the carbon emissions associated 
with our supply chain, providing a greater 
level of disclosure than any other form  
of electricity generation – wind, solar, gas, 
nuclear, which also have carbon emissions 
associated with their supply chains. 
Forest growth
We are seeing the positive effects that 
sustainable sourcing practices are having 
on the carbon stored. For example, in the 
US southeast, where we source most of 
our biomass, increased demand for wood 
fibre has directly led to increased growth 
and protection of forests. Inventories have 
increased by over 90% since 1950 as more 
carbon is stored in these forests year after 
year, despite harvests also increasing. 
Negative emissions
Our confidence in the contribution that 
sustainably sourced biomass can play in 
the UK’s transition to net zero is echoed 
by the UK’s Climate Change Committee 
(CCC). The CCC sees a critical role for 
BECCs in enabling the delivery of the  
UK’s net zero carbon by 2050. 
There is widespread recognition 
among leading science-based 
organisations, such as the UN’s 
Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) that 
sustainable biomass has an 
important role to play in meeting 
international climate targets

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Biomass cost reduction
The Group has identified three 
models through which it 
believes it can deliver a long-
term future for sustainable 
biomass, all of which are 
underpinned by the delivery  
of its supply chain expansion  
and cost reduction plans. 
Drax aims to expand its supply chain to 
5Mt of self-supply capacity by 2027 (from 
1.6Mt today, plus 0.4Mt in development) 
and reduce the cost of biomass to  
£50/MWh (from around £75/MWh in 
2019). We expect to deliver these savings 
through the optimisation of existing 
biomass operations, greater utilisation  
of low-cost wood residues and an 
expansion of the types of sustainable 
low-cost biomass sourced across the 
Group’s expanded supply chain. 
Drax believes that the additional capital 
and operating cost investment required  
to deliver this supply chain expansion is  
in the region of £600 million, which the 
Group expects to invest ahead of 2027. 
This expansion and cost reduction plan 
gives rise to the three options (see page 
17) which are not mutually exclusive. The 
delivery of one or more of these models 
by 2027 is expected to enable Drax to 
continue its biomass activities when  
the current UK renewable schemes  
for biomass generation end in 2027.
Expansion and optimisation 
of existing capacity
Drax currently uses around 7Mt of 
biomass for generation at Drax Power 
Station, 1.5Mt of which is self-supplied by 
our existing pellet production operations 
in the US Gulf.
We have also identified plans to expand 
our three existing production sites – 
LaSalle, Morehouse and Amite – by 0.4Mt 
over the next two years – an investment 
of £50 million, the first 0.1Mt of which  
has now been completed. This will expand 
total capacity to around 1.9Mt, provide 
economies of scale and allow even 
greater utilisation of lower cost residues, 
such as wood chips and sawmill residues.
Other projects include the co-location of 
a third-party sawmill at the LaSalle Plant 
to provide access to sawmill residues, 
lower transport costs and improved 
efficiency; a new rail spur connecting 
LaSalle to the local rail network, 
improving economies of scale in transport 
and fewer road miles; and a new 
chambering yard at the Port of Baton 
Rouge allowing greater rail throughput. 
These larger projects are accompanied  
by small projects to improve operational 
efficiency such as greater efficiency  
in the loading of road haulage.
In 2020, these initiatives and others 
contributed to a 5% year-on-year 
reduction in cost per tonne. The delivery 
of these projects, amongst other 
incremental improvements is expected  
to deliver $35 per tonne of savings on 
1.9Mt by 2022.
In addition to improvements in the US,  
we have also invested to improve  
thermal efficiency at Drax Power Station. 
In 2020 we completed the second of 
three turbine upgrades which has 
improved thermal efficiency and 
alongside other improvements results  
in a reduction in fuel cost in the region  
of £1/MWh. The third outage is scheduled 
to take place in 2021. 
Further expansion of self-supply 
capacity
In 2020 Drax approved the construction 
of three new 40,000 tonne satellite 
plants sited alongside existing sawmills in 
the US southeast at a cost of $40 million. 
These small sites are designed to utilise 
low-cost sawmill residues and leverage 
the Group’s existing infrastructure in the 
region. Drax believes that this approach 
could represent up to 0.5Mt of capacity 
and expects these plants to significantly 
reduce the cost of pellet production 
versus the 2018 benchmark and will be 
operational by 2022.
We will continue to assess opportunities 
to build or buy capacity to support this 
ambition – both in North America and 
other regions where we can demonstrate 
the right combination of sustainability, 
fibre availability, cost and infrastructure.
Exploring alternative fuels
Biomass residues from commercial 
forestry processes represent the majority 
of biomass used by Drax for generation. 
Over the last decade, as part of our work 
on biomass, we have screened hundreds 
Building a long-term 
future for sustainable 
biomass is a key strategic 
objective for Drax
How do we plan to expand and reduce the cost  
of our biomass supply chain?

of different types of materials, and we are 
now using this knowledge of chemistries 
and operational characteristics to inform 
the exploration of alternative fuels.
Examples of these materials include 
sugar cane residues (bagasse), nuts  
and agricultural residues.
Drax believes that in time such materials 
could represent a significant volume  
of sustainable biomass material.
Trading and optimisation
An integral part of our strategy is to 
develop a biomass trading capability. This 
is an optimisation and risk management 
activity to support our aim to deliver 
lower-cost pellets, and non-proprietary 
trading, through which we aim to 
optimise internal and external supply and 
develop opportunities in other markets.
Biomass has an important role to  
play in the UK as a flexible and  
reliable source of renewable energy, 
complementing increased utilisation 
of intermittent and inflexible 
generation across the UK power grid. 
In March 2027, when the current 
renewable schemes end, Drax believes 
that through a combination of peak 
power generation, system support 
services, Capacity Market income  
and a low-cost operating model  
for Drax Power Station (including 
low-cost biomass), this site can 
continue to operate as a merchant 
renewable power station.
 
The CCC has set out what is required 
for the country to achieve its legally 
binding objective of being net zero  
by 2050. This includes a significant 
role for BECCS to remove carbon from 
the atmosphere, creating negative 
emissions. BECCS is the only large-
scale solution for negative emissions 
that also generates renewable 
electricity and can provide system 
support services. Through combining 
BECCS with our existing biomass 
generation units at Drax Power 
Station, we believe we could remove 
millions of tonnes of carbon each year 
from 2027. In doing so Drax aims to 
become a carbon negative company 
by 2030.
The technology to deliver post-
combustion BECCS exists and is 
proven at scale. In September 2020, 
Drax commenced a trial of one such 
technology provided by Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries. In addition, Drax  
is developing innovative technology 
options, including C-Capture, a 
partnership between Leeds University, 
Drax, IP Group and BP, which has 
developed an organic solvent which 
could be used for BECCS. 
Drax expects global demand for 
sustainable wood pellets to increase in 
the current decade, as other countries 
develop decarbonisation programmes 
which incorporate the benefits of 
sustainable biomass for generation. 
Whilst there is an abundance of 
unprocessed sustainable biomass 
material globally, there remains limited 
capacity to convert these fibres to 
energy dense pellets, which have a 
low-carbon footprint and lower cost 
associated with transportation. As a 
result, Drax expects the global market 
for biomass to remain under supplied. 
Drax is therefore exploring options  
to service biomass demand in other 
markets – such as Europe, North 
America and Asia alongside the UK. 
Establishing a presence in these 
markets could offer the potential  
for long-term offtake agreements, 
providing diversified revenues  
from other biomass markets.

Introduction
The Group’s financial performance  
in 2020 has been robust, delivering 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and 
discontinued operations of £412 million, 
which represents a small increase 
compared to the previous year despite  
an estimated impact of approximately 
£60 million as a result of the Covid-19 
pandemic, most notably affecting our 
Customers business (2019 Adjusted 
EBITDA from continuing and 
discontinued operations: £410 million).
Strong availability and output from our 
biomass generation units at Drax Power 
Station underpinned this result. In 
addition, we saw value from system 
support services captured across our 
flexible generation portfolio and the 
continuing delivery of our cost reduction 
targets for biomass pellet production.
We estimate the total financial impact of 
Covid-19 to be approximately £60 million. 
In our Customers business, we witnessed 
a reduction in demand and an increased 
risk of business failure affecting our 
customers. This is reflected in costs 
incurred to exit our previously hedged 
positions and an increase in the provision 
for bad debt. In the Generation business, 
we saw a reduction in ROC recycle values 
and incurred increased outage costs, but 
largely offset this by delivering improved 
returns from flexible generation. We  
were also able to capture benefits from 
our substantial derivatives portfolio 
during a volatile period in markets. 
The sale of Drax Generation Enterprise Ltd (which contained the Group’s CCGT portfolio) to VPI Generation Limited was announced on 15 December 2020 and completed 
on 31 January 2021 (see page 27 for further details). The income, expenditure and cash flows of the disposed operations for both the current and previous year have been 
presented as discontinued operations, and the assets and liabilities of the disposed operations as at 31 December 2020 have been presented as held for sale in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented in this financial review are for continuing operations unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations between 
continuing, discontinued and total amounts for each period are shown in note 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements on page 195. Comparatives for 2019 have been 
re-presented to reflect the income and expenditure for the disposed operations as discontinued. Tables in this financial review may not add down/across due to rounding.
Performance has been robust throughout the year,  
and despite the challenges of Covid-19, Adjusted EBITDA from 
continuing and discontinued operations was £412 million

closure costs include a provision for work 
to ensure the safety of the site following 
the closure of the coal units and a small 
inventory write down for coal we no longer 
expect to burn prior to closure. All costs 
associated with the closure of the coal 
units have been treated as exceptional 
items in the income statement.
The Total operating loss for the year – 
which includes depreciation, amortisation 
and the effect of exceptional items and 
certain derivative remeasurements – was 
£156 million (2019 re-presented: profit of 
£48 million). The year-on-year reduction 
principally reflects £239 million of asset 
obsolescence charges plus the £34 
million of coal closure costs described 
above, The asset obsolescence charges 
are comprised of £226 million related to 
the coal units and a further £13 million in 
respect of the option to develop a new 
combined cycle gas turbine at Drax 
Power Station, which is no longer 
expected to proceed. These one-off 
costs, the majority of which are non-cash, 
have been partially offset by a reduction 
in losses arising on the remeasurement  
of derivative contracts, from £121 million 
in 2019 to £70 million in 2020, as a result 
of sterling strengthening during the year.
On 15 December 2020, we announced 
the sale of our CCGT portfolio to VPI 
Generation Limited for a cash 
consideration of up to £193 million, 
subject to customary working capital 
adjustments. This included £29 million  
of contingent consideration associated 
with the option to develop a new CCGT  
at Damhead Creek. The transaction 
subsequently completed on 31 January 
2021. The CCGTs have performed well 
since being acquired in December 2018, 
delivering £46 million of Adjusted EBITDA 
in 2020 (2019: £39 million). However,  
they do not form part of the Group’s  
core flexible and renewable generation 
strategy. The results of the CCGTs have 
been classified as discontinued operations 
in the consolidated financial statements.
We continued to strengthen our balance 
sheet and capital structure during 2020. 
In August we agreed a new infrastructure 
term loan facility agreement with 
committed funds in both sterling (£45 
million) and euro (€126.5 million), with  
an option to increase by up to a further 
£75 million. In November €31.5 million was 
drawn under this agreement and a 
further £53 million was committed under 
the option which was subsequently 
drawn in December. These commitments 
have competitive effective interest rates 
inside the Group’s current average cost  
of debt. Also in November we issued a 
new €250 million euro-denominated 
bond at 2.625% which achieved a rate  
of 3.24% when swapped back to sterling, 
a record low cost for a Drax public market 
issuance. At the same time, we redeemed 
the existing £350 million sterling bond 
and the £125 million ESG facility, resulting 
in an improved maturity profile and lower 
all-in cost of our debt portfolio. We also 
refinanced our Revolving Credit Facility, 
extending its final maturity date from 
2022 out to 2025 and converted it into a 
£300 million facility with ESG credentials. 
This delivers further enhancements to 
liquidity. Overall, net cash payments  
in respect of debt reduced our 
borrowings by £176 million (2019: 
increased borrowings by £636 million, 
linked to acquisitions).
We continue to generate strong net 
operating cash inflows. Net cash from 
operating activities was £306 million in 
2020 (2019: £413 million). The reduction 
when compared to the prior year 
principally reflects a net cash outflow 
from rebased derivative contracts of £27 
million, as the benefit of cash accelerated 
from such activity unwound over the 
course of the year (2019: net cash inflow 
of £104 million). In addition, 2020 saw  
the introduction of the new tax payment 
regime for large companies, accelerating 
tax payments in the year of transition. 
Cash capital expenditure in the year  
was £174 million (2019: £171 million).
22 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Financial review continued
The Group’s liquidity position remains 
strong and provides a solid platform  
from which we can continue to execute 
our strategy. At 31 December 2020,  
we held cash of £290 million (2019:  
£404 million) and total cash and total 
committed facilities of £682 million 
(2019: £615 million).
We remain fully committed to payment of 
a sustainable and growing dividend. The 
Board will recommend at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting a final dividend 
that takes total dividends for the financial 
year to £68 million, or 17.1 pence per share, 
an increase of £5 million or 1.2 pence per 
share when compared to 2019. 
Financial Performance
Adjusted EBITDA 
Group Adjusted EBITDA from  
continuing and discontinued operations 
of £412 million was slightly ahead of the 
prior year (2019: £410 million) despite  
the impact of Covid-19. This represents  
a robust performance in what has  
been a challenging year. Excluding  
the contribution from the CCGT  
portfolio classified as discontinued  
in the consolidated financial statements, 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing 
operations was £366 million (2019:  
£371 million).
Our Generation business contributed 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and 
discontinued operations of £446 million 
(2019: £408 million), an increase of 9%  
or £38 million compared to the previous 
year. This result was underpinned by a  
5% increase in total output from biomass 
in 2020, to 14.1TWh compared to 13.4TWh 
in 2019. This was supported by availability 
of 91% (2019: 88%). Our strong generation 
hedge book also provided protection 
against volatility in commodity markets 
resulting from Covid-19.
Despite this performance, Generation  
has been affected by the pandemic. ROC 
recycle values fell during 2020 and the 
cost of performing outage work at our 
sites increased as a result of 
implementing social distancing measures 
to enable this work to be carried out 
safely. These factors were offset by 
strong performance in the short-term 
and balancing markets plus some value 
captured from within the derivatives 
portfolio attributable to market volatility 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Our pumped storage and hydro assets  
in Scotland continued to perform well. 
Cruachan pumped storage power station 
contributed significantly to overall gross 
margin from system support activity of 
£118 million. This reduced slightly from 
£120 million in 2019, due to specific 
constraint contract income and benefits 
associated with closing out positions as 
our coal generation forecasts reduced, 
neither of which were expected to recur 
in 2020. This reflects the benefit of 
generating plant that is flexible and  
can turn up and down at short notice  
to meet demand.
The CCGT portfolio performed strongly, 
particularly in the final quarter of the  
year as cold weather and low wind led  
to opportunities in the balancing market. 
Total output from the CCGTs was 
2.8TWh (2019: 2.9TWh) with an EBITDA 
contribution of £46 million (2019: £39 
million). On 15 December 2020, we 
announced the sale of the CCGT portfolio 
to VPI Generation Limited for total cash 
consideration of up to £193 million, 
including £29 million of consideration 
contingent on the development of a new 
CCGT at the Damhead Creek site. The sale 
subsequently completed on 31 January 
2021. Initial cash consideration received 
on 1 February was £188 million, including 
£24 million in respect of adjustments for 
working capital.
Coal contributed approximately 8%, or 
1.6TWh, of our total generation volume  
in 2020 (2019: 3%) and a small loss, as  
the economics as the economics remain 
very challenging. Following the decision 
to close the remaining coal units, made  
in February 2020, total closure costs  
of £34 million have been provided for  
and treated as exceptional items and 
excluded from Adjusted EBITDA – a 
reconciliation of these amounts is 
provided in note 5.1 to the financial 
statements. The trading performance  
of the coal units continues to form  
part of our Adjusted results, and will  
do so until closure. The units will cease 
commercial generation in March 2021 
and close entirely following the 
completion of Capacity Market 
obligations in September 2022, at which 
point we expect to see cost savings  
in excess of £30 million per annum.  
Some of this benefit will begin to 
materialise during 2021.
The Generation business acquires 
biomass pellets predominantly in US 
dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, which 
we actively hedge over a rolling five-year 
period, to manage our foreign currency 
exposure to a weaker pound. The 
renewable support (CfD and ROCs) 
received in respect of biomass generation 
is subject to UK inflation indices, while 
some of our biomass pellet contracts  
are subject to US inflation indices. This 
exposure is managed as part of our active 
long-term financial derivatives hedging 
programme.
We hold a large portfolio of forward and 
option contracts for various commodities 
and financial products, the nature, value 
and purpose of which is described in note 
7.2 to the consolidated financial 
statements. These contracts are held  
to de-risk the business, by protecting the 
sterling value of future cash flows in 
relation to the sale of power or purchase 
of key commodities. We manage our 
exposures in accordance with our trading 
and risk management policies.
From time to time, for example where 
market conditions or our trading 
expectations change, action may be 
needed in accordance with these policies 
to rebalance our portfolio. During 2020, 
this included restructuring in-the-money 
foreign currency exchange and inflation

contracts, to balance short and long 
positions across the duration of the 
hedge. The value of such activity 
increased in 2020, due to market volatility 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
financial impact of these activities – 
which is driven by market prices at the 
point of execution – is included within 
the cost of sales of our Generation 
business and therefore is reflected in  
our Adjusted Gross profit and Adjusted 
EBITDA. This reflects the fact that the 
principal purpose of holding these 
contracts is to manage and de-risk  
the cost of purchasing fuel.
Performance in our Pellet Production 
business has been strong, in terms of 
both quality and quantity of pellets. 
Adjusted EBITDA of £52 million (2019:  
£32 million) increased by 63% and reflects 
a record year for output with 1,5Mt of 
pellets produced (2019: 1,4Mt) and 1.5Mt 
shipped (2019: 1.3Mt). In addition to 
increasing output and lowering the 
overall cost per tonne, we improved pellet 
quality during the year, with a reduction 
in fines (larger particle-sized dust) when 
measured at disport from 7.9% in 2019 to 
5.0% in 2020, a 37% reduction in the year.
This performance comes against a 
backdrop of Covid-19 and Hurricane Laura, 
the latter of which significantly affected 
the areas where we operate in August 
2020. Our teams successfully operated 
our plants throughout these challenges  
to deliver a strong performance, with total 
pellets produced 6% ahead of the previous 
year – a testament to their hard work, 
focus and shared commitment to the 
business and one another.
We continued to make good progress 
with our biomass cost savings initiatives, 
with the overall cost per tonne of pellets 
produced in the year standing at $153  
per tonne (2019: $161 per tonne), a 
reduction of approximately 5%. In 
addition to the increase in tonnage 
year-on-year contributing to the lower 
cost per tonne, we commissioned a dry 
shavings facility at the La Salle plant, 
enabling us to process less expensive 
residual fibre products.
As set out in the biomass cost reduction 
section on pages 16 and 17, there are 
three potential business models for 
post-2027 operations. We believe that  
the strategy to expand self-supply and 
reduce biomass costs supports all three 
of these models.
Our Customers business made an 
Adjusted EBITDA loss of £39 million in 
2020 (2019: Adjusted EBITDA profit of  
£17 million). We believe the reduction of 
£56 million can be primarily attributed  
to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Excluding this impact, the result for the 
year would have been more in line with 
that in 2019.
The majority of this impact was taken  
in the first half of the year and, despite  
a further national lockdown during 
November 2020, the second half of the 
year has out-turned broadly in line with 
the expectations we set out at our 
interim results in July.
We have experienced reduced demand  
in the Customers business as a 
consequence of lockdown and social 
distancing measures in the UK, although 
this effect saw some recovery in the 
second half of the year. Combined 
electricity and gas volumes sold in 2020 
of 17.5TWh were approximately 7% lower 
than prior year (2019: 18.9TWh). As a 
result, revenues have reduced, and we 
incurred costs to exit previously hedged 
positions as demand estimates reduced 
and market prices fell. Overall, gross profit 
in the Customers business reduced by 
£50 million, from £134 million in 2019 to  
£84 million in 2020. This reduction was 
primarily attributable to the effects of  
the pandemic. This impact was partially 
mitigated by delivering operating cost 
savings across the Group during the year 
with consolidated Adjusted operating and 
administrative expenses from continuing 
and discontinued operations £16 million 
lower in 2020 than the prior year. 
Covid-19 has also increased our 
expectation of business failures and bad 
debt charges, particularly in the SME 
segment and among customers in 
higher-risk industries. This is reflected in 
the charge for impairment losses on 
trade receivables for the year of £43 
million, which has increased by £25 
million compared to the prior year (2019: 
£18 million). The bad debt charge for the 
year represents 2% of total Customers 
revenue, including revenues derived from 
lower-risk segments and larger Industrial 
and Commercial customers, up from less 
than 1% in 2019. 
The overall provision for trade receivables 
at the end of 2020 of £60 million (2019: 
£47 million) is based on a consistent 
methodology with that used at the end  
of prior periods, updated to reflect our 
experience of cash collections and 
potential customer business failures  
in the period since the first lockdown 
came into effect in March 2020, and 
using that experience to inform our 
assumptions about future performance. 
In addition, we have credit insurance 
coverage to help further mitigate some  
of this risk.
We will continue to monitor the wider 
Customers portfolio to ensure alignment 
with the Group’s strategy. Whilst we 
remain cautious about the trajectory  
for Covid-19 recovery in our forecasts, 
 we anticipate a return to profitability  
at EBITDA level for this business.
Central and other costs, which reflect  
our core services functions, including  
our innovation teams, were £50 million  
in 2020 (2019: £46 million). The increase 
from the previous year reflects additional 
investment of £8 million in innovation 
activities in support of our strategy, 
including the development of BECCS and 
the zero-carbon Humber project, and an 
increase in insurance costs. Other central 
operating costs reduced – in 2019 we 
incurred one-off costs associated with 
implementing a new operating structure 
and a higher level of costs associated 
with working capital management 
initiatives which have not recurred in 
2020. In 2021 we expect the overall trend 
of investment in innovation to continue.
Total Operating (Loss)/Profit
The Total operating loss for 2020 of  
£156 million (2019: re-presented profit  
of £48 million) includes the effect of 
exceptional items and remeasurement 
gains and losses on derivative contracts 
that are excluded from Adjusted results. 
Our policy and approach to calculating 
Adjusted results is set out on page 153.
In February 2020, we announced the 
decision to cease commercial coal 
generation at Drax Power Station by 
March 2021, with the units closing  
fully once existing Capacity Market 
obligations are concluded in September 
2022. Following this decision, we

recognised asset obsolescence charges 
in respect of associated fixed assets of 
£226 million. We have also provided for 
total closure costs of £34 million in 
respect of employee termination benefits 
and necessary site reorganisation costs, 
within the £25-35 million range previously 
estimated. A breakdown of these costs, 
and the location of the provisions in our 
consolidated balance sheet, is provided  
in note 5.1 to the consolidated financial 
statements. All costs associated with  
the closure of coal have been treated  
as exceptional items and excluded from 
Adjusted results. See notes 2.7 and 5.1  
to the consolidated financial statements 
for more information.
Net fair value remeasurement losses  
on derivative contracts included in 
operating profit were £70 million (2019 
re-presented: losses of £121 million) 
reflecting movements in the mark-to-
market position on our portfolio of 
commodity and financial derivative 
contracts, to the extent they do not 
qualify for hedge accounting. A  
further £22 million of net fair value 
remeasurement gains on power, gas  
and carbon trades related to the CCGT 
portfolio (2019: £12 million loss)  
is included in the result arising on 
discontinued operations.
The net losses in 2020 are predominantly 
the result of the strengthening of sterling 
in the period, which drives the unwind  
of previously built-up gains resulting  
from the value of our extensive portfolio 
of foreign currency exchange contracts. 
These exchange contracts provide 
protection against changes in exchange 
rates for fuel purchases denominated in 
foreign currencies over a five-year period.
Depreciation and amortisation in the 
year, including losses on disposal of 
assets, totalled £177 million (2019 
re-presented: £194 million) a decrease of 
£17 million compared to the previous year. 
Following the decision taken in February 
2020 to close coal generation, associated 
assets were fully written down and no 
longer attract any depreciation charges. 
A further £19 million (2019: £16 million) of 
depreciation relates to the CCGT portfolio 
and is presented in the result from 
discontinued operations.
Profit After Tax and Earnings 
per Share
Adjusted profit after tax from continuing 
and discontinued operations of £118 
million (2019: £118 million) results in 
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 
29.6 pence (2019: 29.9 pence). 
Adjusted profit after tax and EPS from 
continuing and discontinued operations 
have remained broadly consistent 
year-on-year, largely reflecting a 
combination of the factors described 
above, offset by an £8 million increase  
in Adjusted net interest charges and  
a £4 million increase in the Adjusted  
tax charge.
The Total loss after tax from continuing 
and discontinued operations of £158 
million is significantly reduced from the 
equivalent profit of £1 million for the prior 
year, with a corresponding reduction in 
Total EPS from nil pence in 2019 to a loss 
per share of 39.8 pence in 2020. Total 
loss after tax reflects exceptional items 
and certain remeasurements, including 
the derivative remeasurements, coal 
asset obsolescence charges and coal 
closure costs described above. In 
addition, it includes £8 million  
of charges related to refinancing activity 
(2019: included £5 million of costs 
associated with the acquisition bridge 
facility) described in further detail below.
The Adjusted tax charge for continuing 
and discontinued operations of £28 
million (2019: £24 million) reflects an 
effective tax rate of 19%, in line with the 
standard rate of corporation tax in the 
UK. This reflects the benefit of patent box 
tax credits in respect of the biomass unit 
conversions. Total patent box credits 
included for 2020 are £8 million (2019:  
£8 million). This was offset by the 
negative impact of revaluing deferred tax 
liabilities following the UK Government’s 
decision to reverse the previously 
announced reduction in future 
corporation tax rates in the first half of 
the year. The total impact of this change 
was £18 million, with £4 million relating  
to deferred tax balances associated with 
the written down coal assets treated  
as an exceptional item. The remaining  
£14 million charge, which reduces 
Adjusted EPS by 3.5 pence, is included  
in Adjusted Results.
The Group continued to benefit from 
Research and Development Expenditure 
Credits (RDEC) in 2020, with claims 
totalling £6 million recognised as a 
reduction in cost of sales and operating 
expenses (2019: £3 million).
The Total tax credit for continuing and 
discontinued operations of £32 million 
includes the tax attributable to 
exceptional items and derivative 
remeasurements. A full reconciliation  
of the Group’s tax credit for the year is 
provided in note 2.6 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Cash taxes paid during the year were 
£48 million (2019: £10 million). In 2020, 
the Group fell into the new arrangements 
in respect of corporation tax payments 
for very large companies in the UK for the 
first time. As a result, the Group must now 
make tax payments earlier than under 
the previous regime and the increase 
compared to the prior year is a one-off 
impact on transition.

Capital Expenditure
We maintain a disciplined approach to 
capital expenditure, with all significant 
projects subject to appraisal and 
prioritisation by a Capital Committee  
prior to approval. This committee ensures 
overall adherence to our capital 
allocation policy and maintenance  
of an appropriate net leverage profile. 
In 2020, total capital expenditure of 
£200 million, excluding additions to 
decommissioning assets of £29 million 
(see note 5.4), compares with £172 million 
in the previous year. This was lower than 
previous expectations as a result of the 
deferral of some projects due to Covid-19. 
This includes non-essential works at Drax 
Power Station, and delayed timing of 
some investments in our biomass  
supply chain.
The increase compared to 2019 
principally reflects execution of our 
strategy, with significant investments 
made in the expansion of our US pellet 
production facilities, alongside smaller 
projects within our generation portfolio 
to enhance efficiency. Notably the 
expansion at our pellet production  
facility in Morehouse commissioned  
in November 2020. The extensions at  
La Salle and Amite are expected to  
come online by 2022.
Capital investment in our Customers 
business has been limited to £7 million 
(2019: £20 million).  The past capitalised 
spend associated with a new billing 
system of £19 million was stopped in  
2019 and the Group is engaged in active 
discussion with the supplier reflecting the 
supplier’s failure to perform under this 
contract.  No amounts have been provided 
against this value as the Group believes 
that the carrying amount will be recovered 
in full, supported by legal advice.
Cash and Net Debt
We remain focussed on cash flow 
discipline and maintaining a robust 
balance sheet. This is underpinned by 
prudent risk management which provides 
protection in times of economic 
uncertainty and a strong platform from 
which to execute our strategy. 
The Group continued to generate strong 
cash from operations in 2020, with a total 
inflow of £413 million (2019: £471 million) 
before interest and tax payments. This 
reflects our focus on cash flow discipline 
and continued management of working 
capital. Cash received in respect of 2019 
Capacity Market income in January 2020 
(£72 million) and a net cash inflow 
resulting from increased generation  
and a corresponding reduction in coal 
inventories was offset by a net outflow 
from rebasing of derivative contracts  
and an increase in net purchases of  
ROC assets. 
Net cash generated from operating 
activities in the year was £306 million 
(2019: £413 million). In 2020, the Group 
experienced the impact of the new 
arrangements in respect of corporation 
tax payments for very large companies  
in the UK, as described above, which 
increased cash tax payments by 
£38 million compared to the prior year.
Our liquidity position remains strong, 
reflected by all three of our ratings 
agencies evaluating our liquidity 
assessment as Strong. At 31 December 
2020 we held cash of £290 million (31 
December 2019: £404 million), total 
borrowings were £1,066 million 
(31 December 2019: £1,245 million) and  
as a result net debt was £776 million 
(31 December 2019: £841 million). During 
the first half of 2020, the Group was 
assigned its first equivalent to 
investment grade from DBRS. This 
affirmed the strength of our balance 
sheet, strong near-term contracted 
earnings, plus the depth and breadth  
of our available sources of liquidity. 
Our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, 
based on Adjusted EBITDA for continuing 
and discontinued operations, was 1.9x at 
31 December 2020 (2019: 2.1x). After 
adjusting for timing differences related to 
Capacity Market income and cash across 
the current and previous period, the net 
debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.9x at both  
31 December 2020 and 31 December 
2019. On a proforma basis, taking into 
account the initial proceeds on sale of 
the CCGT portfolio (£188 million – see 
below) and removing the associated 
EBITDA contribution (£46 million), net 
debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 31 December 
2020 was 1.6x. 
During the year, the Group continued  
to enhance its access to capital and 
strengthen the balance sheet. In August, 
we announced the agreement of a new 
Infrastructure term loan agreement  
with committed funds in both sterling  
(£45 million) and euro (€126.5 million), 
with a range of maturities between 2024 
and 2030. €31.5 million was drawn under 
the agreement at 31 December 2020.  
The agreement also included an option to 
increase the facility by up to a further £75 
million of which £53 million was agreed  
in November and drawn in December.  
The remaining commitments were 
subsequently drawn on 18 February 2021.
In November 2020, the Group issued 
€250 million of euro-denominated senior 
secured notes which mature in 2025. The 
2.625% issuance achieved Drax’s lowest 
ever priced public offering which, once 
swapped back to sterling, reflected an 
interest rate of 3.24% per annum. The 
proceeds of this issuance were, along 
with existing cash flows, used to redeem 
the Group’s £350 million 2022 sterling 
bond and the £125 million ESG term loan 
facility. Total costs in respect of the 
redeemed facilities, including the 
non-cash impact of deferred finance 
costs, of £8 million have been treated  
as an exceptional item in the income 
statement, in line with previous practice.
A significant proportion, almost 90%,  
of the Group’s debt now falls due in 2025 
or later.
Following the issue of the euro-
denominated notes in 2020, £610 million 
or 57% of the Group’s closing borrowings 
balance is denominated in foreign 
currencies (2019: £374 million, 30%). The 
carrying amount of our foreign currency 
borrowings and, consequently, the value 
of reported net debt is subject to FX 
volatility as a result of translating 
balances at rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date under IFRS.
We use derivatives, including cross-
currency swaps to hedge the sterling 
cost of the interest payments and future 
principal repayments in respect of these 
facilities. In note 4.1 to the consolidated 
financial statements, in addition to  
net debt per the IFRS balance sheet  
(as defined on page 153). we set out  
a reconciliation of net debt that 
incorporates the impact of relevant 
financial derivatives to fix the value  
of sterling principal repayments. At 
31 December 2020, this resulted in net 
debt adjusted for hedging of £819 million.
26 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
In November 2020, we also concluded 
the refinancing of the revolving credit 
facility (RCF). The new RCF matures in 
2025, with an option to extend by one 
year, and replaces the previous facility. 
This £300 million facility provides 
increased liquidity, enabling the full 
facility to be drawn as cash (previously 
restricted to £165 million). The RCF has  
a customary margin grid referenced over 
LIBOR and represents a small reduction 
in cost compared to the previous facility. 
It includes an embedded ESG component 
that adjusts the margin based on the 
Group’s carbon intensity measured 
against an annual benchmark.
The RCF is available to manage low points 
in the cash cycle and was undrawn at 
31 December 2020. Committed facilities 
of £45 million and €95 million under our 
new Infrastructure term loan agreement 
also remained undrawn at 31 December 
2020. Available cash on hand and 
committed, undrawn facilities provide 
substantial headroom over our short-term 
liquidity requirements.
Net cash released from working capital  
in 2020 was £37 million (2019: cash 
absorbed by working capital of £51 
million). We actively optimise our working 
capital position by managing payables, 
receivables and inventories to make sure 
the working capital committed is closely 
aligned with operational requirements. 
As in previous periods, we have 
maintained our strong cash flow focus 
and continued to deliver working capital 
benefits from making sales and 
purchases of ROC assets and utilisation 
of payment facilities, however the overall 
utilisation of these facilities has 
decreased compared to 2019.
Historically, cash from ROCs has typically 
been realised several months after the 
ROC was earned, usually at the end of  
the ROC compliance period; however,  
the Group is able to limit the overall impact 
of ROCs on working capital by making 
separate sales and purchases in the 
compliance period. During 2020, such 
transactions generated a net cash outflow 
of £74.0 million due to more purchases 
than sales in the period. The overall 
working capital inflow from ROCs of £23.1 
million reflects an overall reduction in ROC 
assets held on the balance sheet due to 
decreased generation in the year. The 
Group also has access to facilities enabling 
it to sell ROC trade receivables on a 
non-recourse basis. Utilisation of these 
facilities at 31 December 2020 was £nil  
(31 December 2019: £nil).  
 
In the first half of 2020, the Group rebased 
several foreign currency contracts, which 
resulted in a working capital benefit, with 
total cash released from rebased trades 
still outstanding at 31 December 2020  
of £24 million (in the prior year, total cash 
released from rebased trades still 
outstanding at 31 December 2019 was 
£84 million). A similar exercise for cross-
currency swaps resulted in cash released 
from outstanding trades at 31 December 
2020 of £56 million (31 December 2019: 
£23 million). The overall net outflow 
associated with rebasing activity in 2020 
was therefore £27 million (2019: a net 
inflow of £104 million). 
The Group holds a large portfolio of 
forward and option contracts for various 
commodities and financial products. 
These contracts are held to de-risk the 
business, by protecting the sterling value 
of future cash flows in relation to the sale 
or purchase of key commodities. We 
manage our exposures in accordance 
with our trading and risk management 
policies. These policies provide flexibility 
to optimise our trading position, working 
capital and liquidity when market 
conditions allow, whilst ensuring 
downside protection and prudent risk 
management are maintained. 
In addition, the Group has access to a 
£200 million receivables monetisation 
facility, which accelerates associated 
cash flows and mitigates exposure to 
credit risk. The Group also has access  
to a number of payment facilities to 
leverage scale and efficiencies in 
transaction processing and also 
facilitates a supply chain financing 
scheme, which enables certain suppliers 
to accelerate their payment and which 
supports the wider working capital 
efficiency of the Group. There are no 
changes to the Group’s payment terms 
under this arrangement, nor would there 
be if the arrangement were to fall away. 
The balances outstanding at 31 
December 2020 and the change in 
utilisation in respect of each of these 
facilities is set out in note 4.4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
The overall net cash outflow for the 
period was £114 million (2019: net inflow 
of £122 million), after cash payments for 
capital expenditure of £174 million (2019: 
£171 million), dividend payments of £65 
million (2019: £59 million), net 
repayments of borrowings of £176 million 
(2019: net proceeds from new borrowings 
of £636 million) and payments in respect 
of acquisitions of £nil (2019: £692 million).

Shareholder information
At the Annual General Meeting on 
22 April 2020, shareholders approved 
payment of a final dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2019 of 9.5 pence 
per share (£38 million). The final dividend 
was paid on 15 May 2020. On 28 July 
2020, the Board resolved to pay an 
interim dividend for the six months ended 
30 June 2020 of 6.8 pence per share  
(£27 million), representing 40% of the 
expected full year dividend. The interim 
dividend was paid on 2 October 2020.
At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, on 21 April 2021, the Board  
will recommend to shareholders that  
a resolution is passed to approve 
payment of a final dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2020 of 10.3 pence 
per share (£41 million), payable on or 
before 14 May 2021. Shares will be 
marked ex-dividend on 22 April 2021.  
This brings the total dividend payable  
for 2020 to £68 million and delivers  
7.5% growth on 2019.
Other Information
Covid-19, Brexit and Going Concern
We continue to monitor and assess 
developments and the potential future 
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our 
operations and financial performance.  
As described above, our financial 
performance in 2020 was robust despite 
an estimated £60 million impact on 
Adjusted EBITDA, and we have maintained 
a strong balance sheet with a net debt  
to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and 
discontinued operations ratio of 1.9x at  
31 December 2020.
Looking forward, our business plan for 
2021 and beyond reflects our central 
assumptions regarding the likely duration 
of the pandemic, and the nature of the 
associated restrictions such as social 
distancing. These factors, alongside 
wider macroeconomic considerations, 
can affect the demand for, and price of, 
power. We continue to expect a 
detrimental impact, when compared to 
pre-Covid expectations, in our Customers 
business due to the reduction in demand 
and increase in bad debt risk described 
above. Our forecasts for 2021 assume a 
gradual easing of lockdown in the UK  
will commence as the roll-out of Covid-19 
vaccinations progresses.
We are monitoring developments 
following the end of the Brexit transition 
period. Our consideration of risk impacts 
in respect on Brexit is set out on page 68. 
In addition to the routine scenario 
planning incorporated into our business 
plan process, we have modelled a series  
of scenarios based on our principal risks, 
a reasonable worst case and more extreme 
scenarios. These scenarios have helped 
us to test the Group’s financial resilience 
over both the next 12 months and a  
longer period for the purpose of viability 
reporting (see page 64). In particular, we 
have considered the impact of extended 
generation outages across our portfolio, 
taking into account risks associated with 
plant operations and supply chain, as well 
as commodity price exposure. To date, 
such modelling has indicated that, while 
there would be a financial impact, none of 
the scenarios modelled would result in an 
impact to the Group’s liquidity, solvency or 
covenants that could not be remediated 
by taking mitigating action. In reaching 
this conclusion, no additional financing  
was contemplated beyond existing 
committed facilities. 
Consequently, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue to meet its obligations as 
they fall due for at least the next twelve 
months, while operating within the 
means of its current capital structure. 
Accordingly, the Directors have adopted 
the going concern basis when preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. 
Sale of CCGT Portfolio
On 15 December 2020, the Group 
announced it had reached agreement  
for the sale of Drax Generation Enterprise 
Limited, which held the Group’s portfolio 
of CCGT power stations, to VPI Generation 
Limited for cash consideration of up to 
£193 million, subject to customary 
adjustments. This included £29 million  
of contingent consideration associated 
with the option to develop a new CCGT  
at Damhead Creek.
The sale completed on 31 January  
2021. The Group received the initial 
consideration of £188 million on  
1 February 2021 which included  
£24 million in respect of working capital 
adjustments. The final consideration is 
subject to a completion accounts process 
which is expected to conclude in the  
first half of 2021. The Group anticipates 
recording a small premium on sale in its 
2021 consolidated financial statements. 
The sale price represents a return over 
the Group’s period of ownership 
significantly ahead of the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital.
In the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2020,  
the results of the CCGT portfolio  
(revenue of £181 million, Adjusted EBITDA 
of £46 million and profit after tax of  
£37 million) have been presented as 
discontinued operations in the 
consolidated income statement, and  
the assets and liabilities shown as held  
for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Transaction costs of £4 million have  
been expensed to the income statement 
as incurred and recognised as an 
exceptional item within discontinued 
operations in line with our policy. The 
consolidated income statement for the 
year ended 31 December 2019 has been 
re-presented to show the results for the  
CCGT portfolio on a consistent basis as 
discontinued operations. See note 5.5  
for further details. 
Proposed Acquisition of Pinnacle 
Renewable Energy
On 8 February 2021, the Group 
announced the proposed acquisition  
of 100% of the issued share capital  
of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. 
(Pinnacle) at a price of C$11.30 per share. 
This values the fully diluted equity of 
Pinnacle at C$385 million, with an  
implied enterprise value of C$741 million 
including C$356 million of net debt. The 
acquisition price will be paid in Canadian 
dollars and we expect to manage that 
exposure within our existing foreign 
exchange risk processes. 
The acquisition remains subject to  
Drax and Pinnacle shareholder approval, 
court approval, regulatory approvals  
and the satisfaction of certain other 
customary conditions. Completion is 
expected to occur in the second or  
third quarter of 2021. The acquisition  
will be funded from cash and existing 
arrangements and is expected to be cash 
generative with 2022 EBITDA consensus 
of C$99 million(1). Net debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA in 2021 is expected to be above 
Drax’s long-term target of around 2x 
immediately following completion of the 
acquisition but it is expected to return  
to around this level by the end of 2022. 
Andy Skelton
Chief Financial Officer
(1)  The figure above was a collation of forecasts, 
estimates and opinions made by a number of 
independent research analysts compiled by 
Bloomberg and appearing on Bloomberg’s website 
at the time of the announcement of the Pinnacle 
transaction. The inclusion of this figure may be 
interpreted as a profit forecast in relation to 
Pinnacle for the purposes of the Listing Rules.  
The Directors consider that this figure is no  
longer valid because:
 
(i)  this figure was representative of Pinnacle  
as a standalone entity and does not represent 
Drax’s or the Directors’ views of the expected 
financial performance of Pinnacle under  
Drax’s ownership; and
 
(ii)  the acquisition of Pinnacle will result in a 
number of changes impacting Pinnacle’s 
EBITDA, including the impact of purchase price 
allocation and intra-group trading adjustments.

to keep everything on track 
through hard work, 
determination, and the  
desire to deliver this ground-
breaking project and help 
Drax to deliver its purpose. 
2021 will continue to be a

Keeping our 
people and 
plants safe
 
Safety is a primary focus at 
Drax, and at Cruachan we are 
hugely proud to have had no 
serious incidents in 2020 and 
achieved 16 years since our 
last Lost Time Incident on site. 
For me, the biggest challenge 
in 2020 was introducing 
changes to how we work  
to ensure we protected 
colleagues and contractors 
from Covid-19, whilst 
continuing to keep our  
plants running safely and 
maintaining our focus on 
potential hazards and our 
primary safety procedures,  
to prevent incidents and keep 
everyone safe. Thankfully, 
we’ve achieved good safety 
performance this year at 
Cruachan, whilst delivering 
our outages and project work.“

Covid-19 impact on executive remuneration
Whilst 2020 was a very challenging 
year, it was also a year of 
achievement of which we are 
rightly proud. Colleagues and 
management worked hard to 
deliver our purpose, keep each 
other safe and continue to deliver 
our essential services to the 
country. This culminated in strong 
financial performance and further 
advancement of our strategic 
priorities, which are reflected in  
the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, senior management  
and the wider workforce.
All Drax employees had to adapt to new 
ways of working in 2020. The health, 
safety, and wellbeing of employees  
and contractors has always been of 
paramount importance, but particularly 
so in these unprecedented times.  
During the year the Committee spent  
a considerable amount of time reviewing 
the remuneration and the working 
practice arrangements of the whole 
workforce within the context of the 
challenges of Covid-19. Our priority has 
been to provide pay stability and security 
for our workforce, many of whom are 
classified as key workers. This included 
ensuring continuity of pay for those  
who were unable to work due to illness  
or caring responsibilities as well as our 
commitment not to furlough or make 
redundancies as a result of the impact  
of Covid-19. 
  You can find further information on 
how Drax has supported employees 
through Covid-19 on page 34.
In addition to supporting our colleagues, 
we have also actively supported our 
customers and communities during this 
time. For example, we provided free gas 
and electricity for two months to 162 
independent care homes, allowing  
these vital organisations to divert funds  
to other priorities. We also provided  
over 850 laptops with three months  
of pre-paid internet access to over 50 
schools. This has helped to enable 
students at our partner schools to  
access lessons from home. 
In addition to not utilising any 
Government support, as explained on 
page 88, the Board received regular 
updates on the Group’s liquidity position, 
our available cash and other resources 
which directly informed the decision  
to maintain both the final dividend in 
respect of the 2019 financial year which 
was approved by shareholders at the 
2020 Annual General Meeting and paid 
on 15 May 2020 and the interim dividend 
which the Board approved in July 2020 
and paid on 2 October 2020.
The following table provides a summary 
of the decisions made by the Committee 
in 2020 with respect to key components 
of remuneration. In coming to these 
conclusions, the Committee considered 
several factors. These included external 
advice, the performance of the Company 
and the contribution of employees at all 
levels in delivering the 2020 Group plan 
and the longer-term strategic priorities. 
The Committee also considered the 
extent to which Covid-19 had an impact 
on financial performance and on our 
range of stakeholders – whether 
positively or adversely.

Committee decision
2021 base salary increases 
• To increase the level of base salaries for 
all Directors in line with the average 
increase made to all employees.
• The Company is supportive of an increase to the salaries of all eligible employees in 
2021 which reflects our ability to pay and wider market benchmarking. The increase 
applied also takes into account our commitment to not furlough or make redundant 
colleagues due to Covid-19.
2020 annual bonus outcome
• To pay the bonus awards in the normal 
manner, and in line with the Policy, with 
no adjustment.
• The bonus award is reflective of the Company’s solid performance in a challenging year. 
• The Company bonus criteria for Executive Directors are consistent with those for  
other employees. All eligible employees will receive their bonus.
• Drax maintained its dividend for 2019, paid an interim dividend for 2020 and is 
proposing a final 2020 dividend for approval at the 2021 AGM, the proposed bonus 
payments are consistent with the shareholder dividend experience and our capital 
allocation policy.
• The Company’s balance sheet liquidity and finances are strong.
• We recognise that Covid-19 has brought into sharper focus the responsibilities which 
we all have to safeguarding our people, our communities and our environment. Within 
the 2020 scorecard we included targets associated with a combination of safety and 
engagement with our employees, reputation, as well as ESG measures that included 
targeting improvement in our CDP rating. Our employee engagement survey achieved 
82% score for effective engagement and the Group’s CDP Climate response rating 
improved from C in 2019 to A- in 2020. More information on the 2020 scorecard can be 
found on pages 124 and 125. More information on the Group’s wider initiatives on the 
environment and climate change can be found on page 48. 
2021 annual bonus
• Continue to use performance metrics and 
weightings which are consistent with 
what is stated in the Policy.
• The Company is committed to the operation of a bonus plan for all eligible employees 
for 2021 and the bonus criteria are consistent for all employees.
• On 8 February 2021, we announced our intention to acquire Pinnacle Renewable 
Energy Inc., which is subject to Drax and Pinnacle shareholder approval, and court and 
regulatory approvals. As this transaction would materially impact all metrics in the 
2021 Scorecard, it is not possible to set targets at this time for each metric which has 
been selected for the 2021 Scorecard. The targets will be set as soon as is practicable 
once there is confirmation of whether the acquisition will or will not proceed. The 
table on page 132 sets out the metrics which will be included in the 2021 Scorecard.
2018 PSP Vesting
• To allow the 2018 PSP award to vest 
without adjustment in March 2021.
• The Committee is comfortable that the vesting result is appropriate in the context  
of performance over the three year performance period.
• Drax share price at 31 December 2020 was 39% higher than the start of the 
performance period (given the averaging periods over which TSR has been calculated 
this equates to a return of 15% based on the six month averaging period prior to the 
start and end of the performance period). These returns represent a strong result  
for our shareholders, particularly in the current environment. Performance is assessed 
against a broader FTSE 350 comparator group, where the majority of shareholder 
returns have been negative over the performance period.
• Although Drax’s share price was initially impacted by Covid-19 in early 2020 (as was 
the case for many companies), it recovered strongly, with a shareholder return  
of 28% from 1 January 2020 to the end of the year. 
• Drax has not benefited from unexpected windfall financial performance as a result  
of Covid-19, and the Committee is confident that this return represents genuine strong 
performance and delivery of our strategy in an extremely challenging climate.
2020 LTIP grant
• The grant was made on the normal 
timetable and with the performance 
conditions and targets agreed with 
shareholders. 
• The normal practice of using the 
three-day average share price 
immediately prior to the date of grant to 
determine the number of shares awarded 
was followed.
• The LTIP performance is measured over a three-year period and therefore the targets 
remain appropriate.
• The Committee will assess the value of the 2020 LTIP award at vesting and will ensure 
that the final outturn reflects all relevant factors, including consideration of any 
windfall gains. In making their assessment the Committee will take into account 
appropriate advice (e.g. the Company’s auditors, the Committee’s advisers and the 
Audit Committee), also giving due consideration to the shareholder experience and to 
what extent the outcome incorporates any windfall gain, which warrants adjustment.

Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
Strategy
A purpose, strategy, and ambition that places climate change at the heart of what we do
Governance
Strong governance that embeds climate change in decision-making at all levels of the business
Tackling climate change 
is at the heart of our 
purpose and Drax is 
committed to helping 
the UK and the wider 
world to achieve its 
climate targets. 
Our approach and progress in 2020
Our purpose – to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future – is aligned  
with the UK Government target to achieve 
net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  
Our purpose informs the three pillars  
of our strategy, outlined below. Our  
energy market model uses a range of  
‘net zero carbon by 2050’ scenarios and 
the resulting set of planning assumptions 
enable us to identify actions and the 
associated capital allocation that we  
will take across our strategic horizons. 
1. To build a long-term future for 
sustainable biomass: By expanding our 
sustainable bioenergy supply chain and 
reducing costs we are developing options 
for long-term biomass operations – 
renewable generation, negative carbon 
emissions, system support services and 
third party supply of biomass to 
international markets.
We are investing in the expansion of our 
pellet production facilities as part of our 
biomass strategy, targeting to achieve 5 
million tonnes of self-supply by 2027 and  
to reduce production costs. We believe  
this will give rise to a long-term future  
for sustainable biomass, which includes 
the potential for BECCS and negative 
emissions. This is supported by a robust 
supply chain that is subject to externally-
set regulations and regular audits, to 
ensure the required standards are met.  
We are progressing the BECCS business 
case and technology selection so that  
we can effectively implement and scale a 
cost-effective carbon removal technology.
2. To be the leading provider of power 
system stability: Through a portfolio of 
flexible and renewable generation, and 
large industrial and commercial customer 
supply business, we will provide system 
support services to allow the power 
system to utilise intermittent renewable 
energy accelerating the UK’s 
decarbonisation en route to 2050.
We believe that as the UK power system 
decarbonises, demand will increasingly  
be met by low marginal cost intermittent 
wind generation.

baseload thermal power plants provided 
Our approach
Responding to climate change is a core 
component of our Group governance 
framework. The CEO reports quarterly  
to the Board on Environment, Social and 
Governance (ESG) performance, including 
climate-related matters. Climate change 
factors are considered in decisions taken 
by the Board, reflecting the Board’s duty  
to consider all stakeholders. Examples  
in 2020 include the decision to cease  
coal generation by March 2021 and the 
refinancing of the Group’s debt facilities, 
which link Drax’s carbon emissions to the 
amount of interest paid on the Group’s 
debt (see page 26).
Our Climate Policy, approved by the Board, 
outlines our approach to integrate 
effective management of climate-related 
risks and opportunities into everyday 
decision-making and delivery of our 
business strategy (available at: www.drax.
com/about-us/compliance-and-policies).
Our progress in 2020
In October, the Board reviewed our 
strategic aims and progress, and re-
emphasised Drax’s commitment to our 
purpose, to enable a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future. The Board considered 
how our strategy aligns with good practice 
for purpose-driven organisations and 
committed to explore how this can be 
further strengthened through 2021.
In 2020, engagement with the Executive 
Committee and the Board focused on 
furthering understanding and embedding 
climate-related matters. Engagement in 
2020 included:
• Climate Policy considered and approved 
by the Executive Committee and the 
Board.
• 2020 CDP Climate submission signed off 
by the CEO and CFO.
• At the Group’s interim and full year, the 
Executive Committee and the Board 
examined the Climate Change principal 
risk, considering key evolving challenges 
and potential mitigations.
• The Executive Committee and the Board 
considered management’s response and 
future plans for addressing the TCFD 
requirements, approved initiatives to  
meet these proposals, and approved  
Drax becoming a TCFD Supporter.
Remuneration
Our 2020 Group scorecard included  
a target to improve our CDP Climate score, 
linking remuneration to our performance 
and quality of disclosure on climate 
change.
Our actions for 2021
• Continue schedule of engagement with 
Executive Committee and the Board on 
climate-related matters.
  See Corporate Governance Report 
page 80
  See Remuneration Report  
page 108
The recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) provide a framework for consistent disclosure of 
climate-related information. Drax became a TCFD Supporter in December 
2020. Our approach, progress and the next steps of our journey towards 
meeting the TCFD recommendations in full are summarised below.
In 2020, we responded to the CDP Climate questionnaire, which is aligned 
to the TCFD recommendations. Drax was awarded a score of A-.  
We will continue responding to the CDP Climate questionnaire each year.

Strategy continued
A purpose, strategy, and ambition that places climate change at the heart of what we do continued
both electricity and a full range of 
non-generation system support services. 
These services are important to the safe 
and reliable operation of the system. Given 
its inherent intermittency, wind power  
has limited capability to provide these 
other services, making the system more 
challenging to manage. Throughout 2020, 
we provided these services to the power 
system via our flexible asset portfolio. 
3. To give our customers control of their 
energy: We provide our customers with 
renewable energy, and the opportunity to 
control and optimise energy use and cost, 
helping us support the energy system.
To support the zero carbon and 
sustainability ambitions of our customers, 
we are considering and developing the 
services they need. Our Drax Electric 
Vehicles (EV) service enables customers to 
transition to EVs or optimise their existing 
EV solution. We also provide an Electric 
Assets service, that helps our customers  
to optimise the energy usage of their 
assets and reduce costs.
ESG finance
In 2020, we completed a £300 million 
Revolving Credit Facility. This includes an 
embedded ESG mechanism that adjusts 
the margin of interest paid based on Drax’s 
carbon emissions per GWh of electricity 
generated, measured against an annual 
benchmark. This is consistent with our 
continued strategic focus on reducing  
our carbon emissions.
Scenario analysis
We have considered the potential impact  
of climate scenarios on our business, 
including robust modelling as part of  
our capital projects work. Comprehensive 
modelling was undertaken to assess  
the current flood risk and the potential  
future flood risk associated with the 
redevelopment of Drax Power Station.  
The assessment considered potential 
changes in sea level, changes in rainfall 
and peak river flows based on guidance 
issued by the Environment Agency (EA).
The EA projections considered data  
from the UK Climate Projections 2009 
(UKCP09), which categorise the range  
of possibilities from lower impact to upper 
impact. In compliance with planning 
requests, the assessment considered the 
impacts of the central climate projection 
through to the upper impact projection 
over a medium time phase, covering the 
expected life of the asset.
The project identified a risk of flooding  
in the community and, as a result, a  
flood relief channel has been included  
in the plans.
Our actions for 2021
• Undertake scenario analysis exercise.
  See Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties page 66 
Our approach
The assessment and management of 
climate-related risks is integrated into our 
Group-wide approach to risk management, 
as defined by the Group Risk Management 
Policy. Climate change is a principal risk 
category assessed within this approach. 
The climate change principal risk is owned 
by a member of the Executive Committee 
and subject to a deep-dive review by the 
Executive Committee each year. An 
analysis of all principal risk categories, 
including climate change, is made and 
presented to the Executive Committee  
and Board twice a year.
Our progress in 2020
In 2020, we focused on the development 
of our climate change principal risk 
assessment process. We strengthened  
the assessment of business division 
specific risks, expanded the detail of our 
assessment, and identified risk areas for 
targeted analysis in 2021. A summary  
of the physical and transition risks 
identified is provided in Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties.
In 2020, the Executive Committee 
examined the climate change risks, 
challenging the assumptions, mitigations 
and controls which had been identified.
Our actions for 2021
• Undertake targeted analysis of the risk 
areas identified for further exploration in 
2021.
  See Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties page 66
Our approach
Our ambition is to become carbon negative 
by 2030. This applies across our direct 
business operations globally (scope 1 and 2 
emissions).
We are committed to the Science Based 
Targets initiative, publicly stating our 
intent to externally validate that our  
target is aligned with climate science.
Our progress in 2020
We disclose our scope 1, 2 and 3 
greenhouse gas emissions, alongside 
other key environmental metrics, in  
the sustainable business section  
(see page 48).
In 2020, we undertook work to better 
understand the detail of our scope 3 
emissions. We are developing a scope 3 
target that enables us to align to the 
Science Based Targets initiative.
Our actions for 2021
• Set and publish a scope 3 target.

Our Covid-19 response
Supporting our people
We quickly deployed home 
working for the majority of our 
non-operational colleagues.
Following school closures in the UK, 
we introduced two weeks’ emergency 
paid leave for childcare support. As 
information on the virus and 
Government advice developed, we 
continued to adjust our response 
accordingly. We introduced a Covid-19 
absence policy, extending our 
emergency arrangements, entitling 
colleagues that are unable to work due 
to Covid-19 to full pay.
Health and safety as our 
top priority
We undertook Covid-19 risk 
assessments at each of our sites, to 
identify mitigations to reduce the risks 
of workplace transmission of the virus. 
Throughout the year, our operational 
workforce was able to continue to 
deliver our business priorities, without 
a significant impact or transmission  
of the virus in the workplace. Our 
Generation business, which has 
continued to operate as normal, safely 
delivered several major outages, with 
large numbers of contractors on our 
production sites during the summer.
We deployed home working 
assessments and provided colleagues 
with suitable equipment to make sure 
they could work from home safely.  
We continue to focus on maintaining 
social distancing, hand hygiene and 
reduced occupancy of our workplaces. 
As further waves of virus transmission 
occur across the country, we are 
planning to ensure continued provision 
of adequate support for the health and 
wellbeing of all our colleagues.
Wellbeing
We surveyed colleagues to understand 
how they were coping and to identify 
areas for focus. This was to make sure 
colleagues continued to feel connected 
and supported through the challenges 
presented by Covid-19. To further support 
our colleagues’ physical and mental 
wellbeing, we expanded our virtual 
wellbeing tools and resources offering.
  Read more on Wellbeing in our 
Sustainable Business section, 
page 58.
Charitable and community 
engagement
We continued to provide colleagues  
with ways to engage in community and 
charity activities. We held national 
fundraising days, promoted Give As  
You Earn and shared virtual volunteering 
opportunities to support local charities 
and communities facing the impact  
of the pandemic.
 
Our employees’ health and 
wellbeing are vital, and we 
work hard to ensure we are 
supporting them with both 
their physical and mental 
health, whether working at 
home or at one of our sites.” 
Will Gardiner
CEO
Keeping our people safe,  
whilst providing energy  
and critical services.
Throughout the pandemic we have 
successfully maintained effective 
day-to-day activities, and supported 
our people, communities and 
customers. We continue to maintain 
our sustainability standards and 
meet the needs of stakeholders  
as we progress our long-term 
objectives and invest for growth.
Organising our response
When Covid-19 was declared a pandemic 
in March 2020, we had already 
implemented our crisis management 
structure to manage information and  
our response, and to better understand 
emerging risks. Management and leaders 
from the business units met regularly  
to define and communicate the Drax 
response. Our leadership’s priority was, 
and will remain, the health and safety  
of our colleagues.
Delivering our purpose
As a strategic part of the UK’s critical 
national infrastructure, we continued to 
supply flexible and renewable electricity, 
delivering strong strategic, operational 
and financial performance for our 
shareholders and various stakeholders. 
This allowed us to continue to invest for 
growth, whilst paying a sustainable and 
growing dividend. Throughout the 
pandemic, no employees have been 
furloughed and we have not sought any 
financial help from the Government.

Supporting our communities
Supporting our customers
Throughout the year, we 
continued the vital supply  
of power to around 300,000  
UK businesses, including 
organisations most affected  
by the pandemic, such as care 
homes, hospitals, schools,  
and retailers.
Debt support
We focused on providing extra help  
for our customers facing financial 
hardship due to Covid-19. We retrained 
call centre colleagues to equip them 
with the skills needed to help prevent 
debt and to connect businesses with 
the support they might need, including 
access to Government-backed loans 
and expert financial help.
We created options for smaller 
businesses and organisations 
struggling at this time. For those 
unable to keep their accounts in 
balance or pay in full, we created 
deferred payment plans. We also 
extended current energy prices for 
three months to 4,000 customers 
coming to the end of their contracts, 
giving those businesses an 
opportunity to focus on more pressing 
concerns related to Covid-19.
We donated £150,000 to the specialist 
debt charity Business Debtline. The 
funds are being used to set up and run 
a dedicated webpage and phoneline 
for our SME referrals over the next two 
years. This will help businesses recover 
from the crisis and aims to support 
their long-term security.
We have sought to help our 
communities during the  
Covid-19 pandemic.
Laptops for Learners
Our Laptops for Learners initiative 
provided 853 laptops, each with three 
months of pre-paid internet access,  
to over 50 schools and colleges local 
to our sites across the UK. The 
initiative has enabled students at our 
partner schools in England and 
Scotland to continue to access 
lessons from home.
Online educational resources
We launched an online offering to 
make sure students were able to 
continue learning. This included 
creating virtual tours of our assets  
and educational content, delivering 
webinars to university students,  
and providing a virtual experience  
of work in partnership with Oak 
National Academy.
 
This donation of laptops 
from Drax is going to make  
a huge difference to the lives 
of pupils currently without 
access to online educational 
resources – as well as our 
whole school community 
after the Coronavirus 
lockdown is over.”

Primary School
Care homes
We provided free gas and electricity for 
two months to 162 independent care 
homes local to Drax’s operations across 
the UK. This payment freeze allowed 
these vital organisations to divert funds 
to other priorities, such as PPE, food and 
carers’ accommodation.
 
Not having to pay our energy 
bills for two months means  
we can redistribute our funds 
to buy essential items, like PPE, 
to ensure our employees are 
supported to give our residents 
the level of care they deserve.”

System stability
Why is there a growing 
importance for system  
support services?
Examples of system support services:
Historically, coal and gas-fired power 
stations were able to deliver these 
services as an inherent by-product of 
producing reliable baseload electricity. 
Now, coal and older gas plants are 
being closed down in the UK and being 
replaced by intermittent renewable 
energy sources, principally wind. This 
reduces carbon emissions but makes 
the provision of these system support 
services more challenging. 
Wind, by its nature, is intermittent and, 
for the most part, unable to provide 
system support services. Whilst solar 
generation may be more predictable 
than wind, it does not provide any 
system support services. As demand 
for system support services increases, 
there are fewer assets, such as large 
power stations, able to provide them 
(see Table 1 below). This is increasing 
the cost of operating the system  
and is a growing source of value  
for generators like Drax which can 
provide these services.
Frequency response – The 
automatic change in generation 
output, or in demand, to maintain a 
system frequency of 50Hz. Frequency 
response is required every second of 
the day.
Keeping the lights on requires 
not just electricity generation, 
but also a range of non-
generation activities which 
help provide stability, flexibility 
and reliability, to ensure that 
electricity supply meets 
demand, second-by-second. 
Electricity must be transported the 
length of the country, and levels of 
generation must be managed so they  
are exactly equal to levels being used  
(i.e. balanced), and properties like voltage 
and frequency must be minutely 
regulated across the whole network. 
Ensuring all this happens smoothly relies 
on the system operator – National Grid – 
working with power generators like Drax 
to provide services in addition to power 
generation that keep the power system  
in operation, stable and balanced. We  
call these system support services.

Voltage control/Reactive Power 
(MVars) – Reactive power is used to 
manage power flows around the 
transmission system and helps to support 
voltage in the event of a system fault.
Inertia – The stored energy in 
synchronous generators (i.e. large 
spinning mass such as a biomass or 
pumped storage turbine) which slow 
down the rate of changes in system 
frequency.
Black Start – The ability of a generation 
unit to start up without external electricity 
supplies following a total or partial loss of 
power from the transmission system.
Reserve – The system operator must be 
able to ensure a balance between demand 
and generation at all times to prevent 
power cuts. This increased and decreased 
generation is sometimes referred to as 
headroom and footroom. Managing 
demand can also be used to the same 
effect. As we become more dependent  
on intermittent renewables, we believe 
that the system operator will require  
more dispatchable plant like biomass and 
pumped storage, which can turn up when 
wind speed drops and, crucially, turn down 
when wind speeds are high. 
Pumped storage is particularly useful as, 
in addition to providing a full range of 
generation and non-generation services 
to the system operator, it allows large-
scale wind generation to be stored as 
hydro-electricity at times of excess 
electricity production (by using energy 
from excess wind generation to pump the 
water to storage), before releasing it back 
into the electricity grid when required. By 
way of comparison Cruachan Power 
Station is four times as big as the world’s 
largest battery and can run at full load for 
fifteen hours.

Drax operates a portfolio of flexible, 
renewable and low-carbon generation, 
which is able to provide all of these 
services. As demand for these services 
increases, Drax is able to contract with 
the system operator National Grid to 
provide a range of non-generation 
services, such as a six-year contract 
worth up to £5 million per year 
awarded to Cruachan for the  
provision of inertia in western 
Scotland. The contract does not 
require Cruachan to produce 
electricity, but to be synchronised  
with the electricity system. 
Drax also makes its assets available in 
the short-term balancing mechanism 
to help National Grid balance the 
system on a minute -by-minute and 
hour-by-hour basis. 
We are remunerated for system 
support services via the balancing 
mechanism, specific bilateral 
contracts for ancillary services with 
the system operator. We monitor our 
performance by measuring the gross 
profit earned from these activities 
which we describe as System  
Support Optimisation. 
System support services are principally 
delivered through generation, but  
we also have a growing opportunity  
to provide some of these services 
through our Customers business. 
We provide electricity to large and 
industrial customers, in addition to SMEs. 
Working with these larger customers  
to manage their usage throughout  
the day, we expect to provide demand-
side response services to the electricity 
market – for example, by reducing 
demand at times of lower supply and  
vice versa.

Giving customers control 
of their energy
Demand-side response
How are we supporting  
our customers?
In addition to providing 
our customers with renewable 
energy, we provide them with 
the opportunity to control 
and optimise their energy 
use, cost and source, and  
this helps us in supporting  
the energy system.
Drax is a leading provider of renewable 
energy and services to industrial and 
commercial customers. Haven Power’s 
large portfolio of industrial and 
commercial customers offers 
opportunities to provide system 
support services to the energy market 
and create value for our customers.
In November 2019, United Utilities 
became the first customer to sign up 
to Haven Power’s Asset Flex project. 
Known as Demand Side Response 
(DSR), customers are provided with 
financial incentives to turn down,  
or turn off, non-essential equipment  
at times of peak demand depending  
on the customer’s needs.
The latest customer to sign up for this 
service is Sundown Products, a large 
industrial site with a range of heavy 
machinery, providing another new type 
of asset to control as Haven look to 
broaden their portfolio and knowledge 
base across different technologies.
Haven uses technology to turn down  
or turn off customers’ energy demand  
in peak times to reduce their costs, and  
is designed to always work within the 
constraints set by the customer. For 
example, we could turn off a water  
pump within certain limits or time shift  
a production line. It is simple for the 
customer: Drax has the opportunity  
to create value from the asset in the 
provision of system support services  
and in exchange, customers get a 
cheaper unit rate. 
Reducing demand, typically at peak times 
(which are also periods of higher carbon 
intensity) is another way in which the 
Group is providing system support 
services to the UK power system.

Battery power
Electric vehicles (EVs)
Drax has developed a solution aimed 
at making it easier for companies, 
especially those with fleets, to 
transition to EVs. SES Water was  
the first partner to take this bespoke 
package, which includes vehicle 
suitability assessment, charging 
infrastructure, operating software, 
vehicle telematics, maintenance 
services, and the renewable electricity 
needed to power the vehicles. 
Our energy expertise enables us  
to approach the challenge of 
electrification from a different angle, 
considering on-site energy 
requirements and deploying smart 
charging technology that delivers cost 
and environmental benefits without 
negatively affecting business-as-usual.
The aim is to deliver EV charging and 
battery optimisation, which ties into 
our customer control strategy. By 
understanding all aspects of EVs from 
telematics to charge-point hardware 
and software we are identifying 
opportunities to create value for 
customers and the Group.
Energy storage through batteries  
is also being tested with customers 
who already generate renewable 
energy onsite.
Energy storage is the key to helping 
customers maximise the benefit of  
the energy they generate from their 
own small-scale renewables, providing 
greater flexibility to the grid and 
smoothing volatility in the system.
Drax has partnered with energy 
storage company Eaton, which offers 
new and second-life batteries, such  
as used EV batteries, for installations 
on customer sites. Eaton can quickly 
scale-up the deployment of small 
commercial energy storage systems  
to larger, industrial-scale units, helping 
to support more customers with 
energy management solutions.

Engaging our stakeholders
Why is engaging with our  
stakeholders fundamental 
to our success?
We recognise that we need to listen to, and  
work with, a diverse range of interested parties  
to achieve our purpose: to enable a zero carbon,  
lower cost energy future
Companies Act, 
Section 172 Statement
The directors have a duty to 
promote the success of the 
Company, having regard to a range 
of matters and stakeholders. The 
Board recognises that decisions 
taken today will shape both the 
longer-term performance of the 
business and its impact on our 
various stakeholders.
The Board is responsible for 
engagement with a range of 
stakeholders, and believes that 
considering the interests of our 
stakeholders in key business 
decisions is fundamental to the 
Group’s ability to deliver sustainable 
value creation. This consideration 
enables Drax to have a positive 
impact on the environment, our 
communities and wider society  
over the longer term.
The following pages explain how 
during 2020 the Board had regard 
to those matters set out in Section 
172 of the Companies Act 2006:
On pages 40 to 45 we set out  
the Board’s, and more widely  
the Group’s, comprehensive 
engagement with stakeholders.
On pages 61 to 63 we describe  
how we seek to maintain our high 
standards of business conduct.
On page 88 we describe how the 
Board responded to the Covid-19 
pandemic, including decisions 
taken to support the workforce  
and wider community.
On pages 90 and 91 we describe 
the Board’s leadership of 
stakeholder engagement, including 
a focus on Board decision-making 
and stakeholder and long-term 
considerations.
On page 92 we describe the Board’s 
engagement with the workforce.
On pages 32 and 33 we describe  
the Board’s oversight of TCFD and 
climate-related risks, and in 
Sustainable Business on pages 48 
to 63 we describe the impact of  
the Company’s operations on the 
environment and the community.
The quality of the Group’s 
decision making is richer when 
we actively consider the views 
of stakeholders. 
From our shareholders to our 
colleagues and from environmental 
NGOs (eNGOs) to regulators, we 
recognise that our decisions have 
an impact far beyond our business. 
We proactively seek to understand 
the needs of our stakeholders and 
act upon them to better deliver our 
purpose: to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future.
Stakeholder relations
The world around us is evolving rapidly, 
and the expectations on the business  
are changing too. More than ever before, 
our role in supporting our stakeholders  
is central to our strategy. From tackling 
climate change, to responding to Covid-19 
to levelling up the economy, our aim is to 
be a force for positive change in the 
communities where we operate and in 
addressing some of the major global 
challenges affecting us all.
We recognise that delivering long-term 
value for our shareholders and customers 
is closely linked to delivering good 
outcomes for our climate, environment 
and communities. These factors continue 
to drive changes in regulation, policy and 
public attitudes. Therefore, Drax takes 
great care to anticipate and respond 
effectively to the changing world. To  
that end, the views of all our stakeholders 
forms a core part of the decision-making 
process of the Board and the Group.
Drax has a wide range of stakeholders 
and takes care to ensure that the Group, 
and the Board, has an effective strategy 
to identify and engage with them.  
The Board receives regular reports  
on stakeholder engagement including 
from the Corporate Affairs and Investor 
Relations functions. This ensures that  
the Board takes into account the views  
of our stakeholders when making 
strategic decisions.
Drax’s Communications Strategy 
contains our stakeholder engagement 
plan. Presented to the Board at least 
annually, this sets out and provides 
oversight of how the Group intends to 
engage stakeholders. In addition, the 
Board engages with key communications 
campaigns to better understand the 
needs of those stakeholders that our 
campaigns are targeting. We employ 
dedicated teams to engage both 
proactively and reactively with specific 
stakeholder groups. Our teams include 
stakeholder relations, strategic 
communications, investor relations, HR, 
internal relations, sustainable business, 
business ethics, media relations and 
digital engagement.
The methods of engagement we use  
vary according to the issue and the 
stakeholder concerned. As Drax changes 
and grows, we expect the scope and 
breadth of our engagement with 
different stakeholders to also evolve.
The following pages 40 to 45 set out the 
broad stakeholder groups we identified 
and engaged with in 2020. It also 
highlights their key concerns, why and 
how we engaged, and how we responded.

Understanding the needs of 
our stakeholders is essential  
to our long-term success
Engagement takes place at many  
levels of the business and a judgement  
is made on a case-by-case basis on 
whether engagement is required by  
the Board, Executive Committee, senior 
management or at the operational level. 
The Group Head of Public Affairs 
maintains a detailed map of key 
stakeholders, both internal and external, 
the concerns they’ve raised and the date 
of the last meeting. Management keeps 
under review the relevant stakeholders 
that may be affected by major decisions.
To ensure clear feedback, the Board 
receives regular reports from the CEO  
on key stakeholder relations activity, 
current issues and the relevant feedback 
received from stakeholder interaction. 
These reports are supported by the 
Group Director of Corporate Affairs,  
the Corporate Affairs team and the 
relevant owners of direct stakeholder 
engagement.
The Board has a duty to promote the 
success of the Company, as set out in 
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Supporting this, Board and Executive 
Committee discussions – and 
accompanying papers – include 
information on the stakeholders likely to 
be affected by items under discussion 
and the likely impact. This ensures that 
the interests of all relevant stakeholders, 
and the need to act fairly between 
members of the Company, are considered 
in decision-making.
The most recent detailed review of 
stakeholder activities was presented to 
the Executive Committee and the Board 
in October 2020.
Workforce
Our stakeholders
Key concerns
Beyond Coal strategy, diversity and 
inclusion, response to Covid-19, wellbeing, 
culture and values, future strategy,  
trade union relations, learning and 
development, career progression,  
Health & Safety, reward and recognition.
Why we engage
To enable employees to be better 
informed and able to contribute to the 
delivery of our purpose and strategy, 
whilst creating a safe and engaging 
culture and environment where our 
employees feel valued, respected and 
listened to. We want all employees to  
feel they can grow, develop and make a 
meaningful contribution to our strategy, 
purpose and communities, whilst building 
resilience to cope with the context in 
which we are operating.
How we engage
We maintain regular dialogue with our 
workforce through our engagement 
(MyVoice) forums, colleague briefings, 
weekly updates and Q&A from our CEO 
and our pulse and annual engagement 
surveys. 
Launched in 2019, the MyVoice forums 
align to our operating model and forums 
representing each of the business areas. 
Each forum comprises sufficient colleague 
representatives relative to the size of the 
business, and meet formally each quarter 
and informally as regularly as each forum 
feels is appropriate for local needs. 
Representatives are drawn from across  
the relevant business unit, and each forum 
chair has been selected by membership 
vote. The chairs of each forum come 
together quarterly to discuss workforce 
issues across the business, and discuss 
topics where workforce feedback has been 
sought by the Board. The chairs then meet 
with the Chair of the Board of Directors 
and CEO to discuss the key issues raised, 
with feedback from these meetings then 
shared with all forum members.
Matters discussed during 2020 included 
diversity and inclusion, how effectively  
our Covid-19 response was communicated, 
colleague wellbeing in lockdown, and how 
colleagues would prefer to work in future. 
Employees are also able, anonymously,  
to ask questions of the CEO (“Ask Will”)  
on any subject. The CEO responds to the 
latest questions in his weekly email to  
all colleagues, where he also shares his 
thoughts and highlights of the week.
How we’ve responded
We’ve listened to and acted on feedback 
from both the MyVoice forums and other 
colleague interactions more broadly. This 
included introducing informal and formal 
flexible working policies, and a working from 
home policy and guidance, developing our 
diversity and inclusion strategy, developing 
and delivering plans to further support 
colleague wellbeing including: a dedicated 
intranet resource; Mental Health Awareness 
training for managers; building resilience 
e-learning for all colleagues; raising further 
awareness of existing wellbeing benefits 
available and a step challenge to encourage 
physical fitness and (virtual) social 
connection, and creating a dedicated 
intranet resource to clarify the latest 
guidance and information about Covid-19.
In 2020 employees asked over 1,300 
questions in “Ask Will”. Subjects ranged from 
employees enquiring about the strategy 
and challenging the CEO so they could gain 
a deeper understanding of what we do and 
plan to do, to what Drax is doing to help 
tackle climate change, what employees can 
do individually and Will’s own views. Other 
topics included areas of concern around  
the business; mental health and wellbeing; 
pay and benefits around the Group and new 
or innovative ideas. 
Examples of action taken as a result of  
“Ask Will” questions include increasing our 
Cyclescheme limit to £2,000, as part of our 
voluntary benefits offering; our CEO making 
a statement about Black Lives Matter; and 
doing more to embed diversity and inclusion 
through people stories.
Following the coal closure announcement, 
consultation on all key areas was 
undertaken with trade unions and 
employee representatives. Feedback from 
this process was considered, allowing the 
Board to assess the process undertaken to 
date and consider further measures to be 
implemented, for example resulting in 
changes and enhancements to the financial 
and retraining packages.
We also strengthened our Health and 
Safety function, with the recruitment  
of a new role of Group HSE Director.

Shareholders  
and investors
Our stakeholders continued
Key concerns
Drax strategy, Covid-19 response, capital 
allocation and dividend policy, the 
Capacity Market, share price, financial 
and operational performance, biomass 
sustainability, funding, engagement with 
policy makers, and remuneration.
Why we engage
Engagement allows us to understand  
the concerns and priorities of current  
and prospective investors, and lenders. 
We can then take these into account  
in our decision-making in areas such  
as ESG matters; executive pay; dividend 
and longer term capital allocation policy; 
as well as strategy.
How we engage
We actively engaged with shareholders  
to explain the impact of Covid-19 on the 
Group. In addition to our full and half-year 
results we issued a trading update in April, 
early in the pandemic, in which we set out 
our expectations for the Group as a result 
of Covid-19. Reflecting the constraints on 
face-to-face meetings, most meetings 
have been calls and video calls with 
existing shareholders and new investors. 
We engage through a wide range of 
channels including our website, AGM, 
full-year and half-year results. We also 
have an ongoing programme of investor 
relations meetings. The Chair and Senior 
Independent Director are available to 
speak with investors. In 2020 the Chair  
of the Remuneration Committee wrote  
to a number of shareholders and 
institutional bodies regarding executive 
pay, outlining how we were formulating 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 
response to feedback provided from 
engagement undertaken during 2019.
How we’ve responded
Reflecting feedback from investors and 
an investor perceptions study completed 
in 2019, we continued to develop our 
programme of ESG reporting and 
engagement, which includes developing 
our reporting towards the disclosure 
requirements for TCFD, which we include 
in this year’s annual report. Our Head of 
Investor Relations and Head of Climate 
Change undertook an ongoing 
programme of ESG focused meetings 
with shareholders and investors, primarily 
focused on biomass sustainability and 
carbon accounting.
Engaging with stakeholders
Engaging stakeholders through 
a new approach to negative 
emissions
There is scientific consensus that to  
get to “net zero” emissions, we need to 
address emissions from key sectors that 
cannot decarbonise as much or as fast 
as others. Examples include aviation, 
heavy industry and agriculture. This 
means that in addition to our efforts  
to reduce emissions, we also need to 
invest in technologies that remove 
carbon from the atmosphere. Leading 
expert bodies such as the Climate 
Change Committee, Royal Society, 
Royal Academy of Engineering and the 
Electricity System Operator recognise 
that these technologies will play a 
crucial role in getting to net zero.
In 2020 the Group engaged with a 
range of stakeholders on the role of 
biomass and negative emissions in the 
energy transition and a post-Covid-19 
green recovery. The stakeholders 
included Government, local MPs, 
leaders in industry and business, NGOs, 
think tanks and academics.
The Group’s CEO, Will Gardiner, played  
a key role in leading the debate on 
negative emissions, climate change  
and the importance of Drax’s role in the 
energy transition. He highlighted our 
plans to combine sustainable biomass 
with BECCS, which the International 
Energy Agency recently described as 
the most mature of carbon capture 
technologies. Reflecting the cross-
sectoral need for negative emissions 
technologies, a broad group of 
companies and industry bodies 
launched the Coalition for Negative 
Emissions in October 2020. 
The Coalition ranges from farming to 
aviation and represents hundreds of 
thousands of workers across some of  
the UK’s most critical industries. The 
Coalition jointly wrote to the UK 
Government outlining a shared vision to 
build back better from Covid-19 as part  
of a sustainable and resilient recovery. 
Enabling the fulfilment of this vision is the 
development of pioneering projects that 
can remove carbon from the atmosphere.
Drax has also been championing the 
potential of the Humber region to lead  
a green industrial revolution including  
by deploying BECCS at Drax. A study  
by consultancy Vivid Economics 
(November 2020), commissioned by Drax, 
revealed that tens of thousands of jobs 
could be created and supported in the 
Humber region. 
To make this happen, cutting edge carbon 
capture and hydrogen technologies need 
to be deployed to decarbonise industry 
and deliver a Zero Carbon Humber. With 
the right policy framework, these new 
jobs could begin to be realised as soon  
as 2024. Developing BECCS at Drax could 
support thousands of jobs at its peak, 
including in construction, supply chain 
and the wider economy. This could 
kickstart a new carbon capture and 
hydrogen industry in the UK. 
The Prime Minister’s ‘Ten Point Plan for  
a Green Industrial Revolution’, published 
in November 2020, increased support  
for carbon capture and storage projects 
and accelerated timeframes for delivery. 
It also recognised the role of carbon 
capture and storage in helping 
“decarbonise our most challenging 
sectors, provide low carbon power and  
a pathway to negative emissions”. In 
addition, it acknowledged the creation  
of “SuperPlaces” in areas such as the 
Humber where these technologies could 
be deployed.

Key concerns
Future opportunities for employment, 
investment, tackling climate change,  
our local environmental impact, 
community initiatives and sponsorship, 
action in response to Covid-19.
Why we engage
Drax is an active participant in the 
communities in which it operates. Strong 
community relationships strengthen  
our licence to operate in those areas.
How we engage
We engage regularly with the 
communities around our businesses 
through supporting local initiatives, and 
holding quarterly meetings and formal 
drop-in sessions.
How we’ve responded
In February 2020 we donated £25,000 to 
support the local community around Drax 
Power Station which had been adversely 
affected by severe flooding. We donated 
$30,000 to help families and businesses 
in the parishes around our pellet mills in 
Louisiana and Mississippi in the US, 
adversely affected by both the Covid-19 
crisis and tornadoes in the Monroe area. 
In September 2020 we donated $20,000 
to help families in north eastern and 
central Louisiana who were adversely 
affected by Hurricane Laura.
As a board member and funding partner 
of the Galloway Glens Landscape 
Partnership Scheme, we support its  
work to create local opportunities for  
a sustainable future. This work includes 
the recovery of salmon fish stocks,  
which is a big issue locally and across 
Scotland, and working together to 
support STEM education.
Colleagues have undertaken a range  
of volunteering and charitable work.  
This has included volunteering, outreach 
to partner schools in our communities, 
Group-wide fundraising days and 
colleagues’ personal fundraising efforts, 
for which Drax offers matched funding.
Key concerns
Energy costs, response to Covid-19, 
customer service support, Third Party 
Intermediary relationships, sales and 
product details, energy efficiency, 
managing their own carbon footprint.
Why we engage
Engagement allows us to better 
understand our customers’ needs and 
how we can deliver continuous 
improvement in customer service.
How we engage
Our Customers business engages with  
our customers through a variety of 
channels including social media, our 
website, by phone and through our 
complaints procedure.
How we’ve responded
We listened to how customers were  
being affected by Covid-19 and took 
several measures to support them: we 
retrained call centre colleagues to equip 
them with the skills to help customers in 
need, created deferred payment plans 
and donated £150,000 to Debtline, a 
specialist debt charity. 
We provided free gas and electricity for 
two months to care homes local to our 
operations. You can read more about 
these actions on page 35.
We also engaged with Government on 
behalf of customers, advocating for 
access to Government support for SMEs 
and micro-businesses.
Key concerns
Energy costs, decarbonisation, Carbon 
Price Support, Brexit, Capacity Market, 
climate change mitigation, biomass 
sustainability, Renewable Obligation 
Certificate (ROC) cap, development of 
policy to support BECCS, delivery of the 
UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 
unabated coal closure, Covid-19.
Why we engage
Constructive engagement with 
Government and political bodies is key  
to Drax’s purpose to enable a zero carbon 
lower cost energy future.
How we engage
We regularly engage with regulators  
in the UK, EU and US on a broad range  
of topics including the need for 
decarbonisation, the role of biomass and 
carbon capture and storage policy, and 
the need for system stability and flexible 
generation. For example, in the UK we 
engage with political stakeholders at 
party conferences through all-party 
groups. While Drax makes no political 
donations in the generally accepted 
definition of the term, it is important  
that we engage with politicians, political 
parties, policy makers and other 
stakeholders. You can read more about 
this on page 136.
Our political engagement policy, which 
was developed in direct response to 
shareholder feedback, remains 
unchanged from 2019 and is available  
on our website: drax.com/about-us/
drax-political-engagement-policy/
How we’ve responded
Throughout 2020 Will Gardiner 
participated in regular industry-wide 
forums with the Secretary of State for 
Business Energy and Industrial Strategy 
and the Minister for Energy on the 
response to Covid-19. In response to 
requests from several political bodies we 
commissioned Vivid Economics to assess 
the socio-economic impact of developing 
BECCS at Drax Power Station. Will Gardiner 
has joined the Scottish Government’s 
Green Recovery Taskforce, which was set 
up by the First Minister of Scotland to 
support Scotland’s recovery from Covid-19.

Key concerns
Biomass sustainability, coal and gas, 
climate change, Carbon price support.
Why we engage
Engagement with NGOs helps us to 
challenge and enhance our practices  
on behalf of the wider society. We warmly 
welcome engagement with NGOs and  
the advice and guidance they bring to  
our operations. This year, for example,  
we engaged with Greenpeace, WWF, 
RSPB and many other eNGOs.
How we engage
We engage directly with NGOs on a  
wide range of topics from biomass 
sustainability through to carbon pricing. 
For example, our new Responsible 
Sourcing Policy for woody biomass 
addresses stakeholder issues and  
was developed following a series of 
roundtable discussions.
How we’ve responded
In May 2020 Drax issued a consultation  
to key stakeholders – including NGOs –  
on a new Biomass Carbon Calculator. It 
lasted until June 2020 and in November 
2020 we published a summary of 
responses, alongside an amended 
Calculator that accounted for stakeholder 
views. The Calculator is available on our 
website: www.drax.com/sustainability/
the-biomass-carbon-calculator/ 
In 2020 we asked the Independent 
Advisory Board to review our sourcing 
policy. This came about in light of the new, 
scientific understanding of the climate 
impacts of woody biomass developed by 
the UK’s leading forest science body, 
Forest Research. The IAB confirmed that 
our sourcing policy was in line with the 
Forest Research recommendations.
Key concerns
Targeted Charging Review, smart meter 
installation, energy trading compliance, 
environmental compliance, Health & 
Safety compliance, compliance with 
biomass sustainability policy, system 
support and ancillary services markets, 
ROC compliance, and business ethics 
compliance, including data protection.
Why we engage
Engagement with Ofgem and the 
Electricity System Operator allows us  
to promote and deliver a secure, reliable 
network at least cost to the consumer.  
We support a level playing field for all 
technologies, enabling an efficient and 
investable market. In addition, 
engagement with Ofgem, environmental 
agencies and the ICO enables us to 
promote best practice and ensure we 
remain compliant with latest guidance.
How we engage
We engage directly with stakeholders  
and through industry associations.  
For example, we engage with relevant 
teams at Ofgem and National Grid on  
the growing need for stable markets  
and appropriate support mechanism  
to provide system support services  
to the grid.
How we’ve responded
Following a request from Ofgem on the 
role of pumped hydro storage in the 
future energy system, we’ve created a 
presentation outlining potential support 
mechanisms and shared with Ofgem’s 
market development team.
We are also in discussion with Ofgem  
on potential market solutions to deliver 
system support services that enable 
greater deployment of intermittent 
renewables while also maintaining  
safe and stable networks.
Key concerns
Skills to support future employment,  
local environmental impact, community 
initiatives and sponsorship, “levelling up” 
and supporting STEM jobs.
Why we engage
Our aim is to improve skills, education, 
employability, and opportunities, with  
a particular focus on supporting under-
represented sections of society. 
Engagement with schools and colleges 
allows us to promote interest in science, 
engineering and the energy sector and  
to support educational institutions in 
developing the workforce of the future.
How we engage
We engage directly with schools and 
colleges and offer virtual learning 
opportunities, in addition to free access 
for all students to our site tours during 
term time. Our partnerships with 
organisations such as Teach First support 
the delivery of our activities with schools.
How we’ve responded
In October 2020 Drax committed 
£180,000 in a new five-year partnership 
with Selby College. This will enable the 
college to deliver community education 
programmes and support for retraining. 
Such initiatives will help students develop 
the skills needed in innovative clean 
technologies which will assist in the 
delivery of a zero carbon economy in  
the future.
Following the temporary closure of our 
Visitor Centres and site tours in response 
to Covid-19, we expanded our online 
educational offering in 2020. To provide 
opportunities for continued learning, we 
also donated laptops with internet access 
(see page 35 for more information) and 
delivered virtual tours, university 
webinars, and a virtual experience of work 
in partnership with Oak National 
Academy.
We fund PhD studentships on a range  
of different topics, including engineering, 
policy and forestry.

How we’ve responded
In preparation for the end of the EU 
transition period, we’ve engaged with 
several of our largest suppliers. This 
engagement has helped inform our 
internal Brexit preparation led by the 
Chief Transformation Officer. In turn, 
we’ve used this information to support 
the Government in the development of 
new procedures including on decisions 
about critical goods. In October 2020, the 
Board approved a new Supplier Code of 
Conduct which we are rolling out to all 
suppliers, to support understanding of 
how we can work together to meet high 
standards.
Key concerns
Carbon pricing, carbon capture and 
storage (CCS) policy, biomass 
sustainability, future energy policy.
Why we engage
Engagement allows us to keep abreast  
of the latest thinking, consider likely 
policy developments across a range of 
areas and consider new opportunities  
for innovation and collaboration.
How we engage
We engage with think tanks and 
academics through direct participation  
in events and round tables. We directly 
sponsor several PhDs at British 
universities. We established an 
Independent Advisory Board (IAB) on 
sustainable biomass, which advises  
Drax on feedstock options, forest science 
and the role of sustainable biomass in  
our climate change mitigation activities. 
This allows us to follow the latest 
scientific research and best practice.
How we’ve responded
In response to concerns raised by think 
tanks and academics regarding biomass 
carbon neutrality, we performed and 
published forest catchment area analyses 
which were discussed by the IAB.
The IAB meets four times per year and 
regularly provides feedback and 
recommendations to Drax. Meeting 
agendas, and a high-level summary of  
the minutes and recommendations, are 
published on our website www.drax.com/

read more about the IAB on page 55.
We also sit on steering groups of several 
multi university research projects and 
provide industry input, for example the 
SuperGen Bioenergy consortia in the UK, 
and International Energy Agency – 
Bioenergy work programmes.
Key concerns
Energy policy, reputation of energy sector, 
reputation of biomass sector, Health & 
Safety best practice.
Why we engage
Active membership of a wide range of 
trade and industry associations allows  
us to keep track of best practice in our 
sector and other industries.
How we engage
We engage directly with trade bodies 
focusing on energy and sustainable 
forestry. For example, Drax is an active

of the EU transition period. This included 
enhanced engagement between the 
industry and ministers.
We actively engage at a working level on 
shared interests in the energy sector such 
as carbon pricing, education and skills. We 
also work with businesses from all sectors 
on shared national and regional priorities. 
This includes being members of Scotland’s 
Economic and Social Forum and the

Carbon negative
Our ambition is to become 
carbon negative by 2030
Carbon emissions
Tackling climate change is at the heart  
of our purpose and we are committed  
to helping the UK and the wider world  
to achieve its climate change targets.
Our negative emissions ambition
Drax’s ambition is to become carbon 
negative by 2030, using technologies 
such as bioenergy with carbon capture 
and storage (BECCS) to remove more 
carbon from the atmosphere than we 
produce throughout our direct business 
operations. We are committed to the 
Science Based Targets initiative  
(www.sciencebasedtargets.org), to 
further assure that our target is aligned 
with climate science.
Innovating to decarbonise our business
Carbon capture, utilisation and storage  
is part of our business strategy. In 2020, 
we installed our second BECCS pilot  
at Drax Power Station, whilst moving  
our full-scale design into the next stage 
of detailed engineering. Drax is one  
of the founding members of the Zero 
Carbon Humber Partnership (www.
zerocarbonhumber.co.uk), a consortium 
of energy and industrial companies 
working to develop the UK’s first zero 
carbon industrial cluster by 2040.
Taskforce on Climate-related  
Financial Disclosures
We are committed to the management 
and disclosure of our climate change 
risks and opportunities in line with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD). Our Climate Policy outlines our 
approach (www.drax.com/about-us/
compliance-and-policies). See our TCFD 
summary on page 32.
Flexible, renewable and  
low-carbon energy
Our Generation business operates a 
portfolio of flexible, renewable and 
low-carbon assets to support the energy 
system’s growing use of intermittent 
renewable energy. In 2020, 77% of the 
power generated by Drax was renewable.
Our Customers business is the largest 
supplier of renewable electricity to 
businesses by annual consumption  
and provides a route to market for over 
2,000 renewable generators. For the first 
time, 100% of the electricity procured  
and supplied by Haven Power and Opus 
Energy during the 2019-2020 Ofgem 
reporting year was from renewable 
sources. Our Customers business also 
sold 2.8TWh of gas to customers in 2020.

Direct carbon emissions (scope 1 and 2)
In 2020, our absolute carbon emissions 
(scope 1 and 2) increased by 30% 
compared with 2019. This reflects an 
increase in coal generation in 2020, as 
remaining coal stocks were used ahead 
of the planned closure of commercial 
coal generation at Drax Power Station in 
March 2021. In addition, Shoreham Power 
Station was fully operational in 2020, 
following outage work completed in 2019.

Energy and carbon reduction initiatives
In 2020, we invested in significant 
upgrades to our turbines and associated 
equipment at Drax Power Station and 
Shoreham Power Station, which will result 
in lower carbon emissions and improved 
energy efficiency. At Cruachan Pumped 
Storage Power Station, work to replace 
four sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) circuit 
breakers with vacuum circuit breakers 
was completed in 2020, reducing the 
total potential for emissions from this 
source by up to 500 tCO2e per year.

Indirect carbon emissions (scope 3)
We recognise the impact our carbon 
emissions have across the value chain.  
In 2020, we undertook work with a third 
party, to better understand our scope 3 
emissions in areas such as purchased 
goods and services, and capital 
expenditure. We are developing a scope 3 
target that will enable us to align to the 
Science Based Targets initiative.
The primary contribution to our scope 3 
emissions comes from our fuel and 
energy related activities. This includes 
fuel supply chains, such as biomass, 
natural gas and coal. The second largest 
contribution comes from the use of sold 
products. This includes the end use of 
gas purchased and sold by our Customers 
business. For further breakdown of our 
scope 3 emissions see www.drax.com/
sustainability.
Carbon intensity performance
Between 2012 and 2020, our generation 
carbon intensity has fallen more than 
80%. This reflects the conversion of four 
generating units at Drax Power Station 
from coal to biomass, and the expansion 
and diversification of our generation 
portfolio to include hydro.

Environmental Management Systems 
In the UK, our Generation assets are 
certified through their respective 
management systems to ISO 14001:2015 
and are subject to regular external audits. 
In the US, our Pellet Production sites 
operate under an environmental 
management system that is aligned,  
but not certified, to the principles of 
ISO 14001:2015. During 2020, we 
established a platform to collate our 
environmental monitoring data for our  
US sites. This produces regular reports 
and provides alerts as environmental 
limits are close to being reached.
In 2020, across our UK sites, we had two 
confirmed minor permit breaches related 
to air emissions at Daldowie Fuel Plant 
during emissions testing. At Daldowie, we 
delivered sustained improvements to our 
odour minimisation strategy to address 
neighbourhood odour complaints, as 
required by the Scottish Environment 
Protection Agency (SEPA), which 
substantiated six complaints in 2020. In 
September 2020, we commissioned an 
additional regenerative thermal oxidiser, 
to further treat exhaust air before it is 
released to the atmosphere.
We are working to resolve an odour issue 
at Drax Golf Course, due to improper 
material being brought on site by a third 
party. As ultimate landowner, we are 
working with the Environment Agency 
(EA) and other stakeholders to resolve 
the issue.
In 2020, across our US sites, we had  
two notices of non-compliance issued  
by the authorities. One notice related to 
incorrect handling of wet electrostatic 
precipitator (WESP) material at our 
LaSalle site. The other notice related  
to exceeding VOC emissions limits at  
our Amite site in 2018. In 2020, the 
Mississippi Department of Environmental 
Quality (DEQ) and Drax agreed a 
$2.5 million settlement for the violation  
of VOC emissions limits, dating between 
2016 and 2020. During 2020, the Board 
was kept informed and tracked progress 
in addressing corrective actions.

Environmental impact
As a major electricity producer and 
retailer, and producer of sustainable 
biomass fuels, we take our responsibilities 
to society and the environment seriously. 
We are committed to managing and 
monitoring our environmental impact.  
We seek to reduce the environmental 
impacts caused by our business through 
continual improvement of our operations, 
with particular focus on emissions to air, 
discharges to water, disposal of waste 
and the use of natural resources.
Each business unit reports monthly on 
environmental incidents and near misses, 
and the Board receives monthly reports. 
We also seek to respond to, and track 
actions taken from, any environmental 
complaints made in relation to our 
operations. We investigate all 
environmental events to ensure that root 
causes are established, and lessons are 
learned and shared across the business.
52 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Sustainable business continued
Carbon negative continued
We established an open and direct 
partnership with the DEQ in the  
US states in which we operate to focus 
on settling the emissions to air actions 
and agreeing a path forward. We 
commissioned a full third-party 
environmental audit covering each of our 
US sites, with a focus on positive action 
plans to improve our environmental 
performance, and we track our actions  
to closure on a monthly basis.
Emissions to air
At Drax Power Station, we have focused 
on the new requirements of Annex V  
of the EU Industrial Emissions Directive  
and established a transition plan for 
compliance. We continue preparations  
to deliver improved performance 
considering the Industrial Emissions 
Directive. These new Best Available 
Techniques Reference Document (BREF) 
levels will become the reference point  
for setting permit conditions and have 
included tighter limits for emissions of 
nitrous oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide 
(SO2), mercury and particulate matter 
(PM). Drax Power Station will operate 
within BREF limits from August 2021.
Water use
Our thermal generation sites use water 
for operational and cooling processes. 
Losses occur through steam and ancillary 
processes, and the remainder is 
discharged to the environment. In line 
with our permit requirements, procedures 
are in place to manage water system 
efficiency and usage and to ensure  
that all discharge consent limits are met. 
Between 2019 and 2020, total water 
abstracted for thermal generation use 
increased. This reflects a new borehole 
permit at Blackburn Power Station and 
increased generation output at 
Shoreham Power Station in 2020.
In 2020, 4,289,825,847 m3 of water 
reported as abstracted was used for 
hydro generation at the Galloway and 
Lanark Hydro Scheme. This volume is 
therefore not consumed and is returned 
to the natural environment.
At Cruachan Pumped Storage Power 
Station, water is abstracted by pumping 
from Loch Awe into the upper reservoir, 
when grid generation is surplus. Water  
is then released back into Loch Awe 
when electricity generation is required. 
We closely monitor the arrangements  
for the cycling of this water and report  
as required to SEPA.

Forest positive
Evidencing that our sourcing 
delivers beneficial climate 
outcomes, promotes 
sustainable management, 
protects the environment,  
and supports people 
and communities
At Drax we use wood pellets sourced  
from sustainably managed working 
forests and residues from forest 
industries to generate low-carbon, 
renewable electricity. Our forest positive 
approach to sourcing sustainable biomass 
is made up of the following elements:
• Sourcing sustainable biomass
• Catchment Area Analysis
• Healthy Forest Landscapes
• Independent Advisory Board
Sourcing sustainable biomass
We ensure our biomass is sustainable  
and compliant with relevant legislation 
through Sustainable Biomass Program 
(SBP) certification, alongside proactive 
supplier engagement, other third-party 
certification schemes and our own audits 
and checks.
Our Group Sustainability Policy outlines 
our requirements, and it is evidenced and 
included in biomass supplier contracts. 
Details of our due diligence process are 
available at www.drax.com/sustainability.
Our Responsible Sourcing Policy for 
Biomass outlines our forest biomass 
sustainability commitments. This is to 
provide further assurance that the 
sustainable biomass we source makes  
a net positive contribution to climate 
change, protects and enhances 
biodiversity and has a positive social 
impact on local communities.
Our forest biomass 
sustainability commitments
1.  We will reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions
  We are committed to ensuring our 
use of biomass makes a positive 
contribution to tackling climate 
change and fulfilling the UK’s net 
zero by 2050 target.
2.  We will protect the natural 
environment
  We recognise our duty to keep 
forests thriving and to respect the 
many benefits they bring, including 
carbon storage, protection of soil 
and water quality, supporting 
biodiversity and provision of habitat.
3.  We will support people 
and communities
  From state-owned forests to 
smallholdings, and from the US 
southeast to the Baltic states, 
forest owners, forest workers and 
communities in our sourcing areas 
are bound by their common 
reliance on forests for employment, 
wellbeing and quality of life.
4.  We will invest in research,  
outreach and intervention
  The strength of our collaboration 
with others will improve the 
sourcing choices we make. We  
are committed to working with 
governments, non-governmental 
organisations, academia and other 
stakeholders to continually improve 
biomass sourcing and develop best 
practice.
  Responsible Sourcing: A policy 
for biomass from sustainable 
forests is available at 
www.drax.com/sustainability/ 
responsible-sourcing
Supplier compliance with our policies  
and appropriate legislation is evidenced 
by Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) 
certification, a certification system for 
woody biomass, or by our own checks 
and third-party audits. We require 
suppliers to progress from our own 
checks and third-party audits 
commissioned by Drax, towards SBP 
certification. In 2020, 99% of the woody 
biomass we sourced was SBP compliant.
No concerns regarding biomass supplier 
sustainability compliance were raised  
or escalated to the Group Ethics and 
Business Conduct Committee or the 
Executive Committee in 2020.
Biomass supply chain emissions
Biomass can only be considered a low 
carbon, renewable energy solution when 
it can be evidenced that greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions savings are delivered on 
a lifecycle basis, compared to alternatives 
such as fossil fuel generation. We 
therefore collect fuel and energy data for 
each step in the supply chain, enabling  
us to calculate lifecycle GHG emissions 
for our biomass and to demonstrate 
compliance with our regulatory 
requirements.
The UK Government has set a limit on 
biomass supply chain GHG emissions, 
which must be met by generators to be 
eligible for support under the Renewables 
Obligation and Contract for Difference 
schemes. The current limit is 200 kgCO2e/
MWh of electricity. In 2020, our average 
biomass supply chain GHG emissions 
amounted to 109 kgCO2e/MWh of 
electricity.

Biomass supply chain transparency is a key element of our forest positive approach. In addition to our annual reporting, we  
provide detailed supply chain information at Drax ForestScope (www.forestscope.info). We respond annually to the CDP Forests 
questionnaire and achieved a rating of B in 2020. In 2020 our biomass was sourced from established, responsibly managed working 
forests in the US South, Europe, Canada, Brazil and Russia.

In 2020, we launched our Biomass 
Carbon Calculator, a GHG lifecycle 
emission tool designed to improve  
the accuracy and transparency of 
reporting emissions for wood pellet 
supply chains. The calculator has 
been externally verified against UK 
and EU regulations. It includes all 
material sources of GHG emissions, 
including categories absent from 
other UK reporting tools, such as 
methane and nitrous oxide emissions 
arising from fuel combustion.
Drax is committed to taking a  
leading role in the lifecycle emissions

the long-term maintenance of growing 
forest carbon stock and productivity  
and that helps to improve the health and 
quality of forests. In addition to our due 
diligence processes, we monitor a range 
of data about the forests from which we 
source, to determine whether biomass 
demand is having an impact on regional 
forest industries. This allows us to make 
informed sourcing decisions.
We have completed eight Catchment 
Area Analyses covering Latvia, Estonia, 
part of central British Columbia, the 
catchment around three mills in the 
Chesapeake region in Virginia, seven 
pellet mills in south east Georgia, and 
around Drax’s own pellet mills – LaSalle, 
Morehouse, and Amite. These catchment 
areas provide around two thirds of Drax’s 
supplies. The analysis evaluates the 
trends occurring in the forestry sector 
around the plant to determine what 
impact the pellet demand may have had 
in influencing those trends, positively or 
negatively. This includes the impact on 
harvesting levels, carbon stock, growth 
rate, wood prices, forest management 
practices and the production of all  
wood products.
In the geographies examined so far, data 
collected through our Catchment Area 
Analyses provides robust evidence that 
we are meeting our Forest Biomass 
Sustainability Commitments. For key 
findings and our Catchment Area 
Analysis reports, see www.drax.com/
sustainability/catchment-area-analyses. 
Our intention is to complete Catchment 
Area Analyses for the remaining supply 
areas within the next two years.
Healthy Forest Landscapes
Drax is jointly pioneering the Healthy 
Forest Landscapes (HFL) approach with 
Earthworm Foundation. Earthworm is a 
non-profit organisation that focuses on 
responsible sourcing and is experienced 
in working with companies to develop 
landscape-scale approaches in 
commodity supply chains.
HFL aims to provide an evidence-based 
approach to measure and evaluate the 
ecological, social and economic impacts 
in our supply catchment areas.
The HFL approach measures changes  
in the forest landscape using empirical 
evidence such as big data from 
government statistics and input from 
remote sensing technologies, such as 
earth observation from satellites. HFL 
also uses an Earthworm-developed 
socio-economic evaluation methodology 
to assess community wellbeing.
The HFL approach assesses four key 
metrics – forest cover, carbon stock, 
biodiversity and community wellbeing 
– which will be used across all our 
sourcing areas.
Healthy Forest 
Landscapes metrics 
Forest cover
All other forest landscape attributes 
depend upon forest cover, so 
particular attention is paid to trends 
in forest cover change.
Carbon stock
Carbon sequestration and storage in 
forests is critical to mitigating climate 
change, and therefore crucial to 
track. Measurement of forest carbon 
stock also provides a useful picture  
of forests’ continuing productivity.
Biodiversity
Landscape scale biodiversity is  
an important indicator of healthy 
forest ecosystem functioning, and  
is of concern to both local and 
international stakeholders.
Community wellbeing
Forests have many impacts on  
people who live and work within the 
landscape. This metric addresses 
social aspects of forest landscape 
health, prioritising respect for the 
rights of Indigenous Peoples, and 
includes socio-economic and 
community health, encompassing 
industry workers’ rights.
The HFL approach enables Drax to 
actively identify opportunities to make 
positive interventions which support 
healthy forests, communities, or 
biodiversity.
In 2020, we trialled several 
methodologies to assess the strengths 
and weaknesses of each of the four key 
metrics. We completed analysis around 
our own plants at Amite and Morehouse 
and commenced analysis in the 
Chesapeake catchment in Virginia.
Over the next four years, we aim to roll 
out the HFL approach across all our wood 
source catchment areas. Ultimately, this 
will allow Drax to track and report our 
specific and aggregate impact on the four 
key metrics of forest landscape health  
in a timely and transparent manner.
Independent Advisory Board
Our Independent Advisory Board (IAB)  
of scientists, academics and forestry 
experts is led by Professor Sir John 
Beddington, former Chief Scientific 
Adviser to the UK Government. The  
IAB provides independent advice on 
feedstock options, forest science, 
optimisation of carbon impacts, and  
the role of biomass in supporting the 
transition to a net zero energy system. 
The advice and scrutiny from the IAB 
means our stakeholders can be assured 
that Drax will keep our Sustainability  
and Responsible Sourcing policies under 
review and that the biomass we use 
follows the latest scientific research  
and best practice.
In 2020, the IAB had five meetings and 
discussed topics including Drax’s carbon 
negative ambition, the scalability and 
feasibility of BECCS, and our forest 
Catchment Area Analyses. The IAB 
commissioned two independent pieces 
of work to inform them – a literature 
review on the impacts of bioenergy on 
biodiversity, and a literature review on 
global carbon accounting methodologies, 
which were discussed during the year.  
We publish the IAB’s recommendations  
to Drax on our website.

Sustainable business continued
Our ambition is to improve 
skills, education, employability 
and opportunity for 1 million 
people by 2025
Positive social impact
The UK’s emerging green economy  
and businesses like Drax will play an 
important role in supporting levelling-up 
and closing regional economic and 
productivity gaps across the UK.
New skills are required as we look to 
develop new technologies, including 
BECCS. It is also important we ensure 
people local to our operations are 
equipped with the skills to take 
advantage of these opportunities. At the 
heart of this, our Mobilising a Million 
initiative aims to improve skills, education, 
employability and opportunity for 
1 million people by 2025.
Drax is working with trade unions and 
businesses in the North to galvanise 
support for enhanced jobs and skills for 
the region. Analysis by Vivid Economics 
estimates tens of thousands of jobs could 
be created and supported in the Humber 
if BECCS, as well as hydrogen and other 
carbon removal technologies, are 
deployed to decarbonise industry. With 
UK Government backing, these new jobs 
could begin to be created as early as 2024.
Building the skills of the future
To drive forward our aims, in 2020 we 
established a five-year partnership with  
Selby College. We committed £180,000 
to deliver community education 
programmes and retraining, to support 
people in our communities to develop 
new skills needed for jobs in the green 
economy. Our continued partnership with 
Teach First has enabled the recruitment 
and training of nine Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) 
teachers in 2020, supporting the STEM 
education of 1,125 students.
Apprentices and graduates
We are a signatory to the UK cross-party 
Social Mobility Pledge, which is 
committed to accessing and progressing 
talent from all backgrounds. During the 
year, we focused on apprenticeships and 
use of the Apprenticeship Levy to recruit 
new talent and develop our colleagues. 
The number of Degree Apprenticeships 
undertaken by colleagues has increased, 
from five Degree Apprenticeships 
commenced in 2019 to 12 commenced in 
2020, with a specific focus on MBAs, 
Data Science and Finance qualifications.
Of the 15 graduates we recruited in 2018, 
retention during the programme was 93% 
and all of those completing the 
programme in 2020 secured permanent 
roles at Drax. In 2020, despite the 
challenges of Covid-19, we continued 
development programmes for graduates 
recruited in 2019, and we took on an 
additional three graduates and seven 
Year in Industry students.
In 2021, Drax plans to launch a virtual 
work experience programme, and to 
create further apprenticeships in a 
diverse range of career paths, to support 
the delivery of our business strategy.
Community and charity
We deliver charitable and employee 
volunteering initiatives in the 
communities where we operate. In 2020, 
Drax’s total social contribution was  
£1 million*, including donations through 
employee match funding, payroll giving, 
our community fund, community 
partnerships and fundraising days. 
In February 2020, we donated £25,000 to 
Snaith Priory to help local recovery 
efforts, following flooding in villages 
nearby to Drax Power Station. We 
donated $30,000 to help families and 
businesses in the parishes around our 
pellet mills in Louisiana and Mississippi  
in the US, impacted by both the  
Covid-19 crisis and tornadoes. Following 
Hurricane Laura, we also donated 
$20,000 to the Food Banks of Northeast 
and Central Louisiana.
Prior to Covid-19, our power stations  
at Drax in England and Cruachan in 
Scotland welcomed students for free 
educational tours. During the Covid-19 
crisis, we have expanded our online 
offering – creating virtual tours and 
educational content, delivering webinars 
to university students, and provided  
a virtual experience of work in 
partnership with the Oak National 
Academy – to ensure students were  
able to continue learning.

Safety, health and wellbeing
The safety, health and wellbeing of our 
employees and contractors is a priority for 
Drax and vital to our continued success.
Safety Management Systems
We have safety management systems 
(SMS) in place to ensure safe workplaces 
for all our people. At Drax Power Station, 
the SMS is certified to OHSAS 18001 and 
will transfer to ISO 45001 in 2021. Our 
hydro generation assets, and the gas 
generation assets subsequently sold in 
2021, have an integrated management 
system covering safety, environment  
and quality, and the safety component 
transitioned to ISO 45001 in 2020.
Our Pellet Production sites in the US 
meet the requirements of OSHA 1910  
and the SMS is aligned to OHSAS 18001. 
We undertook an OSHA-10 and OSHA-30 
training programme to strengthen the 
safety leadership and skills of our US 
colleagues, achieving 98% completion  
in 2020. Delivered by registered in-house 
trainers, the training covers risk 
identification and incident handling, set 
in the context of our industry. We have 
also upgraded our approach to tracking 
compliance and corrective actions 
identified from audits or investigations, 
using one consolidated online tool.
Our Customers and Corporate sites in the 
UK continue to implement an SMS, with a 
focus on continuous improvement in our 
health and safety culture and promoting 
both physical and mental wellbeing.
Health and safety performance
Each business unit reports monthly  
on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), 
including Total Recordable Incident Rate 
(TRIR) and Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR). 
Business units also report Reporting of 
Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations (RIDDORs) to 
regulators in the UK. The Board receives 
monthly reports as part of the CEO 
report, which includes information  
on any incidents and tracks trends.  
We investigate all injury events, with 
particular focus on those with high 
potential, to ensure that root causes  
are established and lessons are learned 
and shared across the organisation.
In 2020, our TRIR was 0.29 per 100,000 
hours worked (against a target of 0.21) 
(2019: 0.22 per 100,000 hours worked). 
This reflects an increase in the number of 
minor hand injuries, which have a short 
period of lost time associated. As a result, 
we have implemented a campaign to 
improve risk assessment, raise awareness 
and ensure the right type of personal 
protective equipment is used. Our LTIR in 
2020 was 0.08 per 100,000 hours 
worked (2019: 0.08 per 100,000 hours 
worked).

A combined approach to health, safety, 
environment and wellbeing
In 2020, we appointed an HSE Director 
with Group responsibility to drive HSE 
improvements via a coordinated strategy 
across all our businesses. We are 
establishing plans for 2021 that align  
all the businesses on our key focus  
areas to drive improvement in our HSE 
performance, whilst building upon the 
2019 One Safe Drax vision and aligning 
with our Safe People, Safe Systems & 
Process, and Safety Assurance approach.
HSE performance is reported monthly to 
the Board and reviewed regularly by each 
local management team, and the Group 
HSE performance is reviewed by the 
Executive Committee. Incidents and 
findings are shared across the business 
via safety bulletins, focusing on 
preventative action to be taken to 
mitigate the risk of future occurrences.
The Safety, Health, Environment and 
Welfare Leadership Executive Committee 
(SHEWLEC) is chaired by the UK Portfolio 
Generation Director and meets quarterly 
to receive reports regarding significant 
safety, health, environmental and welfare 
aspects. The Committee establishes 
standards for relevant health, safety, 
environmental and welfare issues. It 
oversees the implementation of relevant 
policies and principles across the 
business, reflecting Group philosophy, 
best practice and regulatory and 
statutory requirements. It also oversees 
HSE governance arrangements across 
the business. We have identified 
developments for our Group HSE 
governance for implementation in 2021. 
This includes changes to the HSE 
Committee structure within the business, 
introducing a Group HSE Committee  
in place of the SHEWLEC.
Key risks and mitigations associated with 
health, safety, environment, and welfare 
are routinely reported to the SHEWLEC. 
The Committee receives a summary of 
results of internal and external audits, 
where the scope falls within the remit  
of the Committee, and receives and 
considers potential implications for  
Drax regarding any significant changes  
in regulation or legislation.
Key issues raised at the SHEWLEC in 
2020 include management of emissions 
and dust at relevant locations, tracking  
of findings from third-party audits, 
actions to address changes in legislation 
(particularly of relevance to our power 
generation fleet in the UK), and delivery 
of a Group-wide approach to safety 
Golden Rules.
In 2020, consultants at the specialist 
health and safety firm DNV-GL were 
engaged to provide a risk-based 
approach to HSE audits, focusing on  
key processes, organisational risks  
and continual improvement. A baseline 
for this Group-wide HSE audit, including 
benchmarking, will be reported in Q1 
2021. Actions arising from the 2019 
Internal Audit report undertaken by 
Turner & Townsend have been tracked  
to ensure implementation of the 
recommendations.

Process safety
We recognise that ongoing process 
safety management is essential for 
identifying and managing process risk to 
reduce the likelihood of a major accident. 
In 2020, we started work to establish the 
key principles of process safety across 
the Generation fleet and these will be 
rolled out Group-wide in 2021. These 
principles are in line with industry best 
practice and focused on controls of  
plant, process and people. A consistent 
approach to process safety policy and 
procedures across the Generation 
business will be delivered in 2021, starting 
with the gap analysis conducted in 2020. 
Improvements and standardisation  
of the management of change process, 
including delivery of training and 
awareness sessions amongst the 
workforce, will be a key deliverable. 
Process safety key performance 
indicators are reported monthly to  
the Executive Committee.
In 2020, all process safety incidents with 
high potential were fully investigated to 
establish root causes and enable 
corrective actions to be focused on 
preventing reoccurrence. Lessons 
learned are shared across the Group.
Wellbeing
We continue to build on our holistic 
wellbeing programme that is overseen  
by our Wellbeing Steering Committee, 
which reported to the SHEWLEC. In 2021, 
we will focus on four key areas: my 
physical health, my mental health, my 
social health and my financial health.
In 2020 we focused on resilience, 
supporting colleagues to adapt in times 
of challenge and change. We provided 
leaders and colleagues with training  
and tools to understand key drivers and 
techniques to provide support. We 
partnered with Mental Health First Aid 
England to provide one-hour live 
webinars, eLearning and materials for 
managers, to raise awareness on how  
to support colleagues with mental health 
issues. During the summer, the entire 
leadership team joined a series of online 
workshop sessions on personal, team  
and organisational resilience, facilitated 
by external experts. Interactive personal 
resilience eLearning was made available 
to all colleagues. We will continue  
these programmes and track completion 
in 2021.
1. We care about what matters
Link to purpose and strategy
We aim to be a sustainable business 
with profitable growth that has a 
positive economic, social and 
environmental impact.
We are committed to enabling a zero 
carbon future, starting with our direct 
operations and our ambition to 
become carbon negative by 2030.
What we did in 2020
The safety and wellbeing of our people 
and communities is the backbone  
of what we do – and has been 
particularly important in our response 
to the Covid-19 pandemic. We did not 
furlough any employees and we 
introduced a new policy to enable 
flexible working. We launched a new 
online benefits platform and provided 
mental health and resilience training, 
to support colleagues with their 
wellbeing.
We developed our Management 
Excellence, apprenticeship and 
graduate programmes, reflecting  
our ongoing commitment to training, 
personal development and supporting 
career progression.
The Board approved our new Climate 
policy, employee Code of Conduct and 
Supplier Code of Conduct (see pages 
49 and 61).
2. We are a can-do kind of place
Link to purpose and strategy
We have a diverse, inclusive culture 
where the continual exchange of ideas 
and perspectives leads to great things.
The conversion of our coal-fired power 
plant to biomass and the development 
of our Electric Vehicles service was 
due to the ingenuity of our people.
What we did in 2020
In our response to Covid-19, we made 
fundamental changes in working 
practices, building new home-working 
processes at speed, to support our 
customers, colleague welfare and  
our communities (see page 34).
Our IT team responded quickly to  
the new requirements of working  
from home as a result of Covid-19.  
This required a new way of supporting 
colleagues, dispatching laptops 
configured to the appropriate working 
requirements, and providing guidance 
on potential threats to our cyber 
security, as well as colleagues’ own 
arrangements for use of online 
devices, to reduce risk from phishing 
attacks and fake websites.
Our internal Modern Slavery Working 
Group brings together colleagues from 
diverse business functions to deliver  
a rolling programme of activity.
People positive continued
In 2020, we completed coverage for UK 
colleagues of a single private medical 
insurance and reward programme. In 
addition, all colleagues across the Group 
have access to an Employee Assistance 
Programme.
People, culture and values
At Drax, our values are driven by our 
culture, fundamental to which is acting 
with integrity – and what we call “doing 
the right thing”. These values are driven 
by our people and permeate through all 
levels of the organisation.
In 2020, we asked our colleagues to 
articulate our culture and values, and 
what it was that they felt amounted to 
the Drax experience. They responded 
with five key themes:

We are proud of our culture at Drax. The Board and  
I seek to set a positive tone from the top and monitor  
culture across the Group. Our colleagues from across  
the business have articulated what they think is the  
essence of Drax and what we believe sets us apart.”
Phil Cox
Chair
  For more information on Board oversight of culture,  
see Corporate Governance Report, page 87.
3. We see things differently
Link to purpose and strategy
We look at the world and see 
possibilities in how we can help to 
solve the climate crisis.
We seek new ways of doing things.  
We repurpose existing assets (such  
as the coal to biomass conversion), use 
our expertise and new technologies to 
innovate (such as BECCS or alternative 
fuels), and embrace opportunities to 
learn so we can become even better.
What we did in 2020
We revised our diversity and inclusion 
strategy and improved colleagues’ 
experience and exposure to diversity 
and inclusion in the workplace. For 
example, we ensured that diversity 
and inclusion is woven through all  
our development programmes, and  
we introduced unconscious bias 
training to managers. We set up panel 
interviews for key positions, seeking  
to make those panels more diverse.  
We also increased the number of 
questions on diversity and inclusion  
in our annual colleague engagement 
survey and utilised the MyVoice Forum 
representatives to feed into the action 
plans arising.
We installed our second BECCS pilot  
at Drax Power Station and we are 
working with the Zero Carbon Humber 
Partnership to enable the 
decarbonisation of the region.
4. We listen carefully
Link to purpose and strategy
We listen to our colleagues, 
communities, customers and other 
stakeholders, working with them to 
better understand their needs, and 
deliver the best possible outcomes.
What we did in 2020
We responded to the needs of those 
stakeholders affected by Covid-19 – 
offering support to colleagues, care 
homes, customers and local schools. 
We continued to run our MyVoice 
Forums remotely, enabling exchange 
of information and an additional 
channel for colleagues to feedback  
on our Covid-19 response.
We received improved engagement 
scores (vs 2019) in our latest MyVoice 
survey results, and changed our 
approach to survey action planning 
using a “bottom up” approach.
We extended our Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) facility to third 
parties. It is available in multiple 
languages and promoted in our 
Supplier Code of Conduct.
5. We do what we say we’ll do
Link to purpose and strategy
We are delivering on our purpose to 
enable a zero carbon, lower cost 
energy future, creating robust plans 
and making the investments 
necessary to help us achieve our aims. 
What we did in 2020
We played a central role in the 
Coalition for Negative Emissions and 
are at the forefront of bringing both 
opportunities and growth to Yorkshire 
and the Humber, whilst tackling 
climate change and creating the green 
jobs of the future.
We are investing £50 million to expand 
pellet production capacity at our 
existing US sites, by 350,000 tonnes 
over the next two years, and the first 
100,000 tonnes has now been 
commissioned.
At Drax, our values are 
driven by our culture, 
fundamental to which 
is acting with integrity – 
and what we call “doing 
the right thing”.

Our people strategy
We work to maintain consistently high 
standards in our employment practices 
and all colleagues benefit from policies  
to support them in the workplace. Our 
five-year People Strategy focuses on 
three key areas.
1.  HR foundations in place that will 
enable the organisation to be fit for the 
future – through data, simplified and 
consistent frameworks and processes, 
and enabling people to contribute to 
our values.
2.  Enabling organisational capability  
and empowerment – supporting the 
positive evolution of our culture, 
alignment of goals throughout the 
organisation, and talent pipelines.
3.  Continuous improvement and best  
in class leadership – a strategic focus, 
and a more empowered and agile 
workforce.
The last year has been a year of change 
for all, and we have seen a significant 
growth in the culture, focus and passion 
of our organisation. In our response to the 
Covid-19 crisis, we demonstrated these 
changes through our culture and brand 
values, to shape the way we all work.
Development and training
We invest in the development of our 
colleagues to help them make the most of 
their talents, meet their career aspirations 
and enhance business performance. Our 
Performance, Potential and Succession 
processes enable managers to identify 
colleagues’ development needs and those 
with the skills and capabilities for 
succession into critical roles. In 2020, we 
delivered over 16 hours of training per 
person, utilising both face-to-face, 
instructor-led training and online learning.
Our Future Creators programme is 
designed to support the development, 
retention and growth of our future 
leadership pipeline. In 2019, 22 high-
potential colleagues attended the 
programme. In 2020, 41% of these 
individuals received at least one upward 
career move and 27% moved into more 
complex roles, with a 100% retention rate. 
A further 12 high-potential colleagues 
have been identified for the next intake. 
The programme has been deferred to 
May 2021 due to Covid-19 and each 
colleague is currently receiving remote 
personal development planning support.
In September 2020 we launched our 
Management Excellence programme. 
The programme is designed to support 
our line managers with key people skills 
and was adapted for online delivery to 
enable continued development despite 
Covid-19. Since launch we have had over 
100 managers on the programme.
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to a supportive, 
diverse and inclusive working 
environment, where you can be yourself 
and your contribution matters. We aim  
to support everyone and to design ways 
of working that are inclusive and flexible, 
enabling equality of opportunity for all.
Our Diversity and Inclusion Steering 
Group meets monthly to consider and 
recommend plans to improve diversity 
and inclusion across Drax. The Steering 
Group is chaired and sponsored by the 
Director of Corporate Affairs and 
supported by the UK Portfolio Generation 
Director, both of whom are members of 
the Executive Committee.
In 2020, we launched a new Diversity  
and Inclusion policy and plan that will 
continue to support our ambitions. Our 
Executive Committee participated in  
a diversity and inclusion workshop to 
understand the role of leadership and  
our leadership team participated in  
a workshop focused on inclusive 
leadership. We published a series of 
colleagues’ personal diversity stories  
on the intranet, to share the breadth  
of diversity across Drax.
Our diversity and inclusion strategy has 
been broadened out beyond gender, 
focused on building a supportive, diverse 
and inclusive working environment, 
where every colleague feels that they 
belong and can contribute. In 2021, our 
diversity and inclusion plan will focus on:
1.  Collating data and using insight to 
support us in taking meaningful action.
2.  Educating and inspiring our colleagues 
on diversity and inclusion.
3.  Through our actions, making careers

Colleague representation 
and engagement
At Drax, 21% of our workforce is covered 
by collective bargaining and we have 
employee representative consultation 
and information arrangements in place 
for employees with individual 
employment contracts.
We communicate with our workforce 
through channels including our intranet, 
our quarterly magazine, newsletters, and 
open forum meetings. During the year, 
colleagues asked our CEO over 1,300 
questions through our online Q&A portal, 
with the CEO and experts’ responses 
shared weekly across the Group.
Each business unit has a MyVoice Forum 
with up to 12 colleague representatives, 
enabling an exchange of information and 
views on strategic decisions affecting the 
way we work. Forum chairs are supported 
by an Executive sponsor and meet 
quarterly with our CEO and Chair of the 
Board of Directors to provide feedback  
on topics raised by colleagues. In 2020, 
topics covered included: our annual 
results, a remuneration update, data 
protection, our Covid-19 response, future 
ways of working, wellbeing and 
recognition. For more information see 
Focus on Workforce Engagement, 
Corporate Governance Report, page 92.
We track colleague engagement through 
our annual survey. In 2020 this was 
completed by 71% of colleagues, a 6% 
increase from 2019. Our score for 
effective engagement of 82% in 2020 is 
4% above the Energy and Utilities sector 
benchmark. We have seen an 
improvement in nine out of 10 question 
areas, with wellbeing growing as the key 
driver for effective engagement. The 
main theme highlighted for improvement 
was colleague careers.
Responding to feedback raised in our 
2019 survey, we introduced our 
Management Excellence Programme  
to equip line managers with key 
management skills. We improved our 
communications on change in the 
business, surveyed colleagues to monitor 
wellbeing and connectedness in the 
context of Covid-19 and, as a result, 
adjusted working arrangements. We also 
expanded our wellbeing offering and 
community support activity (see page 
34).
Ethics and integrity
At Drax, we are committed to conducting 
business ethically, with honesty and 
integrity, and in compliance with all 
relevant laws and regulations. We do not 
tolerate any form of bribery, corruption, 
human rights abuse, or other unethical 
business conduct.
Our business ethics compliance 
framework consists of principles, policies, 
and guidance. The principles are set out 
in our Drax Code, which identifies the 
behaviours expected from permanent 
and non-permanent workers on a broad 
range of topics. The Drax Code principles 
form part of our terms of employment 
and include a series of training videos 
which can be referenced by colleagues.
Our business ethics policies and guidance 
documents provide further instruction. 
These include our Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption (including conflicts of 
interest), Human Rights, Fair Competition, 
Financial Crime, Privacy and Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) policies and our Gifts 
and Hospitality, Conflicts of Interest, Due 
Diligence, Fair Competition, Privacy and 
Speak Up guides. In 2020, a Group policy 
project was progressed, to review, update 
and harmonise policies across Drax, as 
required, to support the Drax Code.
In 2020, we deployed new annual 
refresher eLearning across Drax, for data 
protection and anti-bribery and 
corruption, for all relevant colleagues. A 
dedicated business ethics eLearning 
module was also provided to and 
completed by all members of the Board 
and Executive Committee.
Responsibility for ethics and business 
conduct
Governance of our business ethics 
framework is overseen by the Drax  
Ethics and Business Conduct Committee 
(EBCC), a sub-committee of the Executive 
Committee. The EBCC comprises senior 
leaders, meets quarterly, and is chaired  
by the CFO. A formal report on the work 
of the EBCC is provided annually to the 
Audit Committee. Management across 
Drax is responsible for demonstrating 
leadership on ethical matters and 
supporting teams to apply our ethical 
principles, set out in our Drax Code,  
and business ethics policies.
Our Business Ethics team manages  
our business ethics programmes, taking 
steps to understand our risk profile, 
developing and maintaining policies  
and procedures, raising awareness  
and training, as well as investigating  
any potential breaches of policy, and 
supporting our internal and external 
Speak Up (whistleblowing) channels.

Drax Code of Conduct
In September 2020, a new Code of 
Conduct (Drax Code) was approved 
by the Board. In October, the Drax 
Code was deployed as a mandatory 
read and completed by all permanent 
and relevant non-permanent workers. 
We have also built the Code into our  
new starter induction processes.
The Drax Code expands on those 
topics previously covered in our 
“Doing the right thing” handbook, to 
include other areas such as Health 
and Safety, Environment, Diversity 
and Inclusion, Dignity at Work, and 
Treating Customers Fairly.
Having a Code helps us to aim for and 
maintain consistently high standards 
in everything we do. The Code 
outlines what we expect from all 
those covered by it and supports the 
positive development of our culture. 
The Code also provides our external 
stakeholders with confidence that  
we are committed to doing business 
ethically and that we only wish to 
work with those who do the same.

Sustainable business continued
business ethics programmes and any 
recommendations for improvement  
are duly considered and, as appropriate, 
implemented.
The Business Ethics team conducts 
annual risk assessments of each of its 
programmes, covering anti-bribery and 
corruption (including conflicts of 
interest), fair competition, financial crime, 
privacy, Speak Up (whistleblowing), and 
supply chain human rights. This is to 
ensure policies and procedures remain  
fit for purpose and to recommend any 
further mitigation measures. Our annual 
review timetable includes a review of 
Drax gifts and hospitality records and  
a colleague business ethics declaration, 
which was completed by 100% of 
colleagues in 2021 (covering 2020).
Results of annual reviews, details of 
investigations conducted, Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) reports, and audit 
outcomes are reported regularly to both 
the EBCC and the Audit Committee.  
The Board now receives an update  
on Speak Up (whistleblowing) reports  
at each meeting.
Working with others
We are a signatory to the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC) and maintained our 
representation on their Modern Slavery 
Working Group in 2020. This enables us 
to benchmark our compliance 
programmes and exchange experience 
with peers, with a particular focus on our 
response to the UK Modern Slavery Act.
We seek to work with third parties whose 
standards are consistent with our own. 
Relevant third parties are subject to our 
precontract due diligence checks and 
regular monitoring throughout the term 
of the contract, via our third-party due 
diligence system. In cases where a red 
flag is raised, we follow an EBCC-
approved escalation protocol. Depending 
on the nature of the flagged issue, we 
may decide not to engage with a new 
third party, to engage on a conditional 
basis, to collaborate on remedial action or 
to end an existing business relationship.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier 
Code) was approved by the Board in 
October 2020. The Supplier Code sets  
out the commitments and standards  
we expect of our third parties and, going 
forward, will replace the Corporate 
Responsibility statement used in our 
contracts. A working group has been 
formed to agree the implementation  
plan to deploy the Supplier Code, as 
appropriate, to our suppliers in 2021.
Anti-bribery and corruption
Our internal processes ensure 
consistency with our zero-tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption. 
Geographic risk is factored into our 
third-party due diligence process and 
system. Conducting business in certain 
higher risk countries must receive prior 
approval from the EBCC.
Third parties in higher risk countries 
receive a higher level of initial due 
diligence and ongoing monitoring. We 
also screen the affiliates (directors and 
shareholders) of third parties identified 
as potentially higher risk, and refresh 
their information on a more frequent 
basis compared to other suppliers. 
Ongoing monitoring is performed with 
new information provided to the EBCC,  
as appropriate.
In 2020, we combined our anti-bribery 
and corruption and conflicts of interest 
programmes and strengthened our 
approach to the reporting of supplier 
conflicts of interest. We also separated 
the content of our Corporate Crime policy 
to form separate Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption (including conflicts of 
interest), Human Rights and Financial 
Crime policies. We developed a Conflicts 
of Interest Quick Reference guide and 
provided training to US based managers.
Fair competition
We are committed to conducting our 
business in accordance with all 
applicable fair competition law and we  
do not tolerate any anti-competitive  
and anti-trust behaviour or activity.
Our dedicated fair competition 
compliance programme includes a  
Fair Competition policy and guide and 
covers both UK competition law and US 
anti-trust law. We provide eLearning  
for those that need to know more and 
targeted learning for our ‘at higher risk’ 
teams. In 2020, a video on this topic was 
included in the new Drax Code, which 
sets out the baseline knowledge that  
we expect all our people to have with 
regard to fair competition. In addition,  
we reviewed our policy and guidance  
and completed our second annual risk 
assessment and risk register, which  
was reviewed by the EBCC.
Data privacy and security
We take seriously the privacy and 
security of the personal data we control. 
We are committed to maintaining 
effective privacy and security 
programmes to ensure that our people, 
customers and the third parties with 
which we engage have confidence  
in our data handling practices.
Our maturing privacy programme is 
managed by the Data Protection team 
and overseen by the EBCC. It is 
implemented through policies, guides, 
privacy notices, third party due diligence 
questionnaires and contractual terms. 
During 2020 we issued eLearning 
training to UK colleagues and invested  
in privacy designed compliance software 
to support our work in areas such as 
individual rights requests and personal 
data breaches. Internal Audit completed 
a positive audit of our privacy programme 
in 2020. Our privacy programme 
supported our Covid-19 response, with 
particular reference to handling 
additional health data, temperature 
checks and home working guidance.  
We benchmarked ourselves against the 
new accountability tracker published by 
the Information Commissioner’s Office 
and have incorporated relevant aspects 
into our work plans for 2021.
Our security framework matured  
through 2020, embedding security risk 
management controls into our business 
change activities, improving cyber 
technical capabilities and expanding 
security controls and architecture into 
our operational technology systems 
through our NIS Directive compliance 
programme. We mobilised quickly in 
response to Covid-19 to provide secure 
working from home solutions with 
minimal impact on our control 
environment or risk profile. An 
independent maturity review was 
undertaken against a security best 
practice framework in 2020, which  
noted that Drax has a “well-structured 
and capable security function that  
has matured significantly” since 
establishment.
We maintain a risk-based security 
controls framework aligned to industry 
standards, to protect our business, 
colleague and customer data and meet 
our regulatory requirements. In addition 
to traditional IT security measures,  
we use cyber technologies to detect,

respond to and resolve cyber threats  
and attacks. We are conscious that such 
threats continue to change and our 
security programme seeks to evolve our 
controls and response to cyber threats.
Labour and human rights
Our commitment to the protection of 
human rights includes not tolerating the 
use of underage workers or forced labour. 
This is set out in our Human Rights policy, 
Drax Code and Supplier Code.
Our Supplier Code outlines the standard 
of ethical business conduct we expect 
from our suppliers. Businesses in our 
supply chain should offer a safe 
workplace for their employees that is free 
from harm, intimidation, harassment and 
fear. The Supplier Code emphasises our 
requirement for our suppliers to challenge 
unethical behaviour and promote a “speak 
up” culture and provides the details of our 
available Speak Up channels for their use 
in multiple languages.
Non-financial information statement
We have summarised our policies and disclosures in relation to non-financial matters, in line with the Non-Financial Reporting 
(NFR) requirements of the Companies Act 2006. This report forms our UN Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress 
and we have mapped the NFR requirements to the four issue areas of the Ten Principles of the UNGC.

Supply chain human rights 
(modern slavery)
Our Modern Slavery Working Group, 
chaired by a member of the Business 
Ethics team, oversees a three-year 
rolling programme, and reports 
quarterly to the EBCC.
In 2020, we published our fourth 
Board-approved Modern Slavery 
Statement in accordance with the UK 
Modern Slavery Act (www.drax.com/
modern-slavery-act/). It describes  
the steps we are taking to reduce  
the risk of modern slavery in our 
supply chain. We responded to the  
UK Government’s consultation on 
Transparency in Supply Chains and 
are positioned to meet the new 
requirements.
We keep our programme and 
statement under review to ensure it 
reflects our activities, global presence 
and wider evolving practice.
Speak Up (whistleblowing)
As part of our commitment to 
transparency, openness and continuous 
improvement, we actively encourage 
those working for or on behalf of Drax to 
raise genuine concerns about practices 
which could breach laws, regulations or 
our own ethical standards. Drax has a 
zero tolerance of retaliation and we have 
processes in place to apply appropriate 
consequences, should an individual 
victimise or retaliate in any way against 
someone who has raised a genuine 
concern. During 2020, we issued specific 
guidance on treating concerns 
respectfully.
In 2020, we launched our new Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) programme (see 
Corporate Governance Report, page 87). 
During the year, nine concerns were 
reported across both our internal and 
external channels. This is an increase 
from eight reports in the previous year 
and reflects our continued efforts to 
promote an open and approachable 
culture of “speaking up” across Drax.
64 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Viability statement
The assessment of viability was led by  
the CEO and CFO in conjunction with 
divisional and functional management 
teams and presented to the Board as  
part of the annual planning process. In 
reviewing this assessment, the Board  
has considered the principal risks faced 
by the Group, relevant financial forecasts 
and sensitivities, the availability of 
adequate funding and the strength  
of the Group’s control environment.
Assessment period
The Board conducted this assessment 
over a period of three years (2019: three 
years), selected for the following reasons:
• The Group’s Business Plan (the Plan) 
which is prepared annually, updated 
three times during the year and also 
used for strategic decision-making, 
includes a range of financial forecasts 
and associated sensitivity analysis. This 
Plan covers a three-year period in detail, 
before extending into the medium term. 
• Within the three-year period, liquid 
commodity market curves and 
established contract positions are  
used in the forecasts. Liquid curves 
typically cover a one to two-year window 
and contracts cover periods between 
one and ten years. In particular, the 
Group benefits from the stable and 
material earnings stream available  
from the CfD until 2027. Selecting  
a three-year period balances short-term  
market liquidity against longer-term 
contractual positions.
• There is limited certainty around the 
Group’s markets and regulatory regimes. 
However, in selecting a three-year period 
the Board has assumed no material 
changes to the medium-term regulatory 
environment and associated support 
regimes beyond those already 
announced at the date of this report.
The business considers longer term 
forecasts for other purposes, including 
value in use analyses and estimates of 
useful economic lives in respect of its 
businesses and fixed assets, as set out  
in the notes to the financial statements. 
Review of principal risks
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, set out in detail on pages 
66 to 77, have been considered over  
the period.
The principal risks with the potential to 
exert significant influence on viability are: 
commodity price changes, political and 
regulatory changes, and plant operating 
failures. A significant adverse change to 
the status of each risk has the potential 
to place material financial stress on  
the Group.
The risks were evaluated, where possible, 
to assess the potential impact of each  
on the viability of the Group, should that 
risk arise in its unmitigated form. The 
potential inputs were included, where 
appropriate, as sensitivities to the Plan 
and considered by the Board as part of 
the approval process, in January 2021, 
before the Plan was adopted by the 
Group. In addition, reasonable scenarios 
that included a combination of 
unforeseen plant outages, increases  
in commodity prices and reductions  
in subsidy income were also considered. 
The outcomes of this analysis, which  
did not reflect the potential benefit of 
available mitigating actions, indicated 
that the Group would be able to absorb 
the impact of such scenarios without 
significant impact upon its ability to  
meet liabilities as they fall due.
As part of its review of principal risks  
and uncertainties, the Group considered 
emerging risks related to Covid-19, the 
end of the Brexit transition period and 
climate change. This review concluded 
that such matters remained low risk to 
the Group from a viability perspective. The 
Board’s response to Covid-19 during 2020 
is described in further detail on page 88.
The Group has a proven track record  
of rapidly adapting to changes to its 
environment and deploying innovative 
solutions to protect its financial 
performance. Previous adverse events 
have arisen and provided challenges 
which tested the ability of the Group  
to deliver on its targets but, on each 
occasion, it has been able to respond 
positively and manage the impact.  
This provides the Board with further 
confidence that risks can be sufficiently 
mitigated, and viability can be maintained 
during the assessment period.
Review of financial forecasts
The Plan considers the Group’s financial 
position, performance, cash flows, credit 
metrics and other key financial ratios and 
was most recently updated to reflect 
current market and external environment 
conditions in December 2020, including 
assumptions related to the ongoing 
impact of Covid-19. It is built by business 
and segment and includes growth 
assumptions appropriate to the markets 
each business serves. 
The Plan includes certain assumptions, 
the most material of which relate to 
commodity market price curves and 
levels of subsidy support available to  
the Group through the generation of 
biomass-fuelled renewable power.  
It is underpinned by the stable revenues 
available through the generation of 
CfD-backed electricity and contracted 
sales from the Customers business.
The Plan is subject to stress testing, 
which involves the construction of 
reasonably foreseeable scenarios, 
including those aligned to the principal 
risks (described above) which test the 
robustness of the Plan when key variables 
are flexed both individually and in unison. 
Where such a scenario suggests a risk to 
viability, the availability and quantum of 
mitigating actions is considered. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period significantly 
longer than the 12 months required by the going 
concern provision.
 
 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020 65
Strategic report
Governance
Financial statements
Shareholder information
As part of stress-testing the Plan, a 
“reasonable worst case” scenario was 
also constructed and assessed. Rather 
than a single event, the Board considers 
the most significant scenario that could 
reasonably arise in the assessment 
period, and materially impact viability,  
to be an aggregation of multiple incidents 
either in a short timeframe or repeatedly 
during the period. For the purpose of 
creating the scenario, the severity of 
these incidents (for example, the duration 
of an unexpected outage) was based  
on experience of actual historical events 
or reasonably foreseeable future 
downside scenarios.
The reasonable worst case considered 
the impact on earnings, cash flow and 
net leverage as a result of a series of 
incidents including unexpected 
generation outages, pellet production 
outages, a reasonable reduction in 
Customers gross margin, increases in 
commodity prices and a loss of ROC 
income during the period. Whilst the 
outcomes from this scenario were severe, 
they indicated that the Group would 
continue to operate within the 
restrictions of its financing arrangements 
and would have sufficient cash to meet 
its liabilities as they fall due once likely 
mitigating actions were taken into 
account. Such mitigating actions 
included potentially reducing levels of 
capital expenditure and dividend 
payments if required. The impact would 
also be partially mitigated through the 
earnings stability provided by the CfD, the 
Group’s proven ability to trade effectively 
in volatile markets, use of existing 
committed and undrawn facilities and 
reductions in other discretionary 
expenditure. Based on its review, the 
Board is satisfied the viability of the 
Group would be preserved in a range of 
scenarios, with various mitigating actions 
available, sufficient to manage the risk, 
including significant deterioration of 
commodity market prices.
Availability of adequate funding
The sources of funding available to the 
Group are set out in note 4.3 to the 
financial statements (page 184). The 
Board expects these sources, along with 
stable cash flows generated by the Group 
from its normal operations, to provide 
adequate levels of funding to support the 
execution of the Group’s Plan.
During 2020, the Group issued €250 
million of loan notes and entered into a 
new infrastructure term loan facilities 
agreement with committed funds in both 
Sterling (£45.0 million) and Euro (€126.5 
million), with an option to increase by up 
to a further £75.0 million. At the year end, 
the loan notes were drawn in full and a 
further €31.5 million and £53.0 million 
drawn under the infrastructure facilities. 
The proceeds of these issuances were, 
along with existing cash flows, used to 
redeem the Group’s £350 million 2022 
sterling bond and the £125 million ESG 
term loan facility.
These arrangements both extended the 
maturity profile of the Group’s debt and 
reduced the overall cost of debt, further 
strengthening the balance sheet. No 
significant repayments of debt fall due 
within the assessment period.
In addition, the Group completed the 
refinancing of its revolving credit facility. 
The new £300 million facility matures  
in 2025 with an option to extend by one 
year. This replaces the previous RCF, 
which was due to mature in 2021, and 
provides increased liquidity with the full 
facility now able to be drawn as cash  
(the previous facility restricted cash 
drawn to support liquidity to £165 million).
At 31 December 2020 the Group had total 
cash and committed facilities of £682 
million. The Plan demonstrates that the 
Group expects to operate within its 
current committed facilities for the 
duration of the three-year viability period. 
The Board is confident that the Group 
has access to a range of options to 
maintain a diverse and well-balanced 
capital structure. 
Expectations
The Directors have considered a range  
of factors in their assessment of viability 
over the next three years, including the 
latest Plan, scenario analysis, levels of 
funding, the control environment and  
the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group. The Directors have  
also considered the availability of actions 
within their control in the event of 
plausible negative scenarios occurring. 
Based on this, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period of their assessment.
66 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Principal risks and uncertainties
The effective 
management of risk 
supports the delivery  
of our strategy
Identifying, assessing and managing risks 
across the Group is an integral part of the 
delivery of our strategy. We manage the 
commercial and operational risks faced 
by the Group in accordance with policies 
and processes approved by the Board.
The Board is responsible for determining 
risk appetite and ensuring the 
effectiveness of risk management and 
internal controls across the Group.  
The Group has a comprehensive system 
of governance controls to manage all  
key risks.
Group approach to 
risk management
The risk appetite is the level of risk that 
the Group is prepared to tolerate, and 
which might arise in the day-to-day 
conduct of our business and seeking  
to realise our strategic objectives. Risk 
appetite can vary depending on the 
nature of the risk and expected returns. 
Risk appetite also informs the expected 
behaviours from our employees, 
contractors and business partners,  
and the investment required to support 
risk management activities. We consider 
a range of risk categories including 
environment, people, health and safety, 
political and regulatory, strategic, 
operational, financial, and climate 
change. The Board determines the  
risk appetite of the Group and seeks to 
ensure that emerging and existing risks 
are identified and managed to increase 
the likelihood that the Group’s business 
objectives will be achieved. The Group 
has a Risk Management Policy, approved 
by the Board, which defines its approach 
to risk management. The key elements  
of the policy are to:
• Identify risks that have the potential  
to threaten the achievement of our 
strategic objectives and assess the 
likelihood of the risk occurring using a 
risk scoring methodology which ensures 
a consistent approach when assessing 
all risks.
• Consider the possible impact to the 
business in the event of any risks arising 
and put in place appropriate mitigating 
controls intended to manage identified 
risks to an acceptable level.
• Assign responsibility and define 
accountabilities for the identification, 
assessment and management of risk 
and provide resources to enable 
appropriate measures to be taken.
• Provide a framework to enable the 
escalation and reporting on potential 
and emerging risks and the effectiveness 
of the mitigations and controls to 
support management decision making.
• Regularly monitor changes in the 
internal and external environment of  
our business, review the Group’s principal 
risks against such changes to ensure our 
analysis remains accurate and relevant 
and review the effectiveness of 
mitigation strategies and the application 
of the risk framework employed.
The risk management approach 
manages, rather than eliminates, the  
risk of failure to achieve strategic and 
business objectives, and provides 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Risk management governance
The risk management governance 
structure includes the Executive 
Committee (from which are identified  
the owners accountable for each 
principal risk) and our risk management 
committees whose shared 
responsibilities include:
• Ensuring that risks including new, 
potential and emerging risks are 
identified, assessed and managed 
effectively within defined risk appetites 
and limits.
• Ensuring that risks associated with  
the Group’s principal risk categories  
are identified, analysed and managed 
appropriately.
• Ensuring that changes in the internal 
business and external macro 
environment that affect the principal 
risks are kept under review and 
responded to appropriately.
• Driving completion of the actions 
required to reduce risk exposure and 
improve risk mitigation.
• Driving an appropriate risk management 
culture that promotes and creates 
balanced risk-taking behaviour and clear 
accountability.
• Demonstrating robust governance of 
risk management by reviewing and 
challenging risk management across  
the Group.
In line with good governance the risk 
management committees undertake 
regular reviews of business unit and 
financial risks and receive reports from 
business units and risk owners reflecting 
their specialist areas and technical 
knowledge. The Executive Committee 
also undertake deep dive reviews of all  
the principal risks through the course of 
the year and receive reports from the risk 
management committees and principal 
risk owners. 
In addition, the Audit Committee and 
Board review the suitability and 
effectiveness of risk management 
processes and controls on behalf of  
the Board and receive updates from 
management at each meeting. The  
Board also receives updates on the  
risk management framework. 
Internal control
The Group has a well-defined internal 
control system supported by policies  
and procedures, documented levels of 
authority which support decision-making 
and accountability for management 
across the Group. 
The Board has adopted a schedule of 
matters which are required to be brought 
to it for a decision, below which authority 
is delegated through the Executive 
Committee to a combination of sub-
committees and management enabling 
them to make decisions on behalf of the 
Group and its businesses on a day-to-day 
basis. The most recent review of the 
schedule of matters by the Board was  
in December 2020. The internal control 
system is designed to ensure that the 
directors and executive maintain 
effective oversight and direction for all 
material strategic, operational, financial 
and organisational issues. 
Under authority delegated by the Board, 
the Audit Committee, approves and 
implements a programme of internal 
audits covering various aspects of the 
Group’s activities for the next financial 
year. The programme evolves based on an 
assessment of the key risks of the Group, 
the existing assurance and controls  
in place to manage the risks, the core 
financial control framework and 
observations arising from management’s 
review, discussion and challenge by the 
Audit Committee including responses to 
findings from the observations arising 
from the work of the Internal Audit 
function and support of other specialist 
advisers. The programme is reviewed

quarterly and refreshed to reflect 
developments within the Group as well  
as changes in wider practices, informed 
by the experience of internal and  
external personnel. 
During 2020 internal audits were 
performed either by team members  
of the Group’s internal audit function  
or with effect from July 2020 by KPMG  
who was formerly the Group’s co-source 
internal audit function provider. The 
internal audit function reports to the  
CFO and the appointment of KPMG  
was considered and approved by the 
Audit Committee. The findings and 
recommendations from each internal 
audit are documented in a report for 
internal distribution and action. A full 
copy of the report is distributed to the 
Executive Committee and the Audit 
Committee. Each report includes the 
status of management responses to  
the findings and recommendations and 
details of the actions that management 
propose to take. Each meeting of the 
Executive Committee considers the 
status of closing recommended actions. 
In addition, the Audit Committee receives 
a full internal audit and quarterly internal 
controls update report at each meeting.
Based on the assessments undertaken  
by each of the Executive Committee and 
the Audit Committee during 2020 and 
considered at the meeting of the Board 
held in finalising the Annual report and 
accounts, the Board determined that  
it was not aware of any significant 
deficiency or material weakness in the 
system of internal control. For further 
information on the work of the Audit 
Committee see page 98.
Overall risk assessment
The Board has assessed the principal risk 
categories including assessing continued 
emerging risks arising from the 
unexpected events of the Covid-19 
pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty 
experienced during the year concerned 
with Brexit. As an immediate response  
to the pandemic, the Group deployed its 
disaster recovery arrangements which 
facilitated assessment of the potential 
impact and subsequent monitoring of 
mitigation measures. As the appreciation 
of key issues and challenges matured,  
the initial crisis threat was de-escalated, 
and actions were monitored through 
established teams. 
Throughout the year particular attention 
was given to ensure the Group remained 
as materially unaffected by possible 
Brexit outcomes including a no deal exit 
from the EU. Any additional change in 
managing these and other new and 
emerging risks has not materially 
affected the categorisation of the 
Group’s principal risks. Therefore the nine 
principal risk categories disclosed on 
pages 69 to 77 remain unchanged from 
2019, when climate change was added as 
a principal risk reflecting the increasing 
medium to longer term focus on such 
risks, and their importance to the Group’s 
strategy and the nature of the Group’s 
sector and operations.
Risk impact of Covid-19
The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has  
had and is expected to continue to have 
an impact on the global economy, our 
customers, suppliers and the health, 
safety and wellbeing of our employees 
and contractors. The Group prioritises 
health, safety and wellbeing and has  
put in place a number of actions and 
additional measures to safeguard all 
those who are still required to attend  
the Group’s operational sites. This 
includes the Group ensuring it remains 
cognisant of any continual changing 
guidelines issued by the UK Government 
and US authorities. All of the actions 
implemented enabled the Group to meet 
its obligations as part of the UK’s critical 
national infrastructure, generating power 
and supporting the UK’s energy market 
and our business customers while 
protecting our employees. 
The Group has an incident crisis 
management process enabling timely 
response to events when they occur 
which comprises of strategic (led by the 
Executive Committee), in addition to 
tactical and operational level teams (led 
by management). In response to Covid-19 
these teams developed and implemented 
additional policies and procedures 
around health, safety, IT systems, remote 
working practices, wellbeing 
communications and engagement. In 
response to the continual changing 
environment created by the pandemic 
constant monitoring of these plans and 
their effectiveness is being undertaken.
Since the start of the pandemic and as  
it has evolved, the Board has received 
regular reports from management and 
supported critical decisions connected 
with the Group’s response to the events 
and activities as outlined above. This has 
included for example, how the Group has 
adjusted its working practices across all 
of its operation sites, its communication 
strategy with and on safeguarding its 
employees, implementing new IT 
infrastructure to support changes in 
working practices away from offices,  
and being able to continue to accurately 
track its financial and non-financial 
business performance. The Board also 
received reports on how Covid-19 might 
impact risks in the medium to longer  
term enabling them to reassess the 
future impact on all of the Group’s 
principal risks. Further details on how  
the Group responded to the pandemic  
is detailed in the section “Our Covid-19 
response’” on pages 34 and 35.
The impact of Covid-19 on each principal 
risk and the mitigating actions adopted in 
response to the risk are detailed on pages 
69 to 77 and the changes arising from 
Covid-19 are denoted by the 
Covid-19  symbol.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
The Group has kept under review its 
financial forecasts and its best estimates 
of the financial impact of the associated 
risks which were initially disclosed in the 
trading update issued in April 2020 and 
thereafter in the Half Year results. The 
initial analysis has remained broadly 
unchanged in terms of the impact on  
the Group for the 2020 financial year  
and is fully reflected in its viability 
statement (see page 64). Additional 
information on the commercial and 
financial impact for the Group of Covid-19 
during the 2020 financial year can be 
found on pages 20 to 27.
The Board recognise that going forward 
the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic 
continues to carry inherent uncertainties 
and future impacts may well continue to 
evolve even when events have returned 
to relative normality. These impacts could 
lead to further change in UK Government 
policy, macroeconomic policy and the 
behaviours of people and markets that 
may impact some of the Group’s risks. 
The Board continues to have regular 
engagement with management on the 
Group’s response to any of these risks in 
order to assess, monitor and promptly 
respond to any evolving impact of 
Covid-19 on our operations and business, 
including impacts for all our stakeholders. 
Risk impact of Brexit
Throughout 2020 the Group continued to 
monitor and prepare for the UK’s customs 
exit from the EU including managing for a 
no deal Brexit. An internal working group 
consisting of relevant management 
chaired by a member of the Executive 
Committee, regularly reviewed 
developments in negotiations and 
possible effects on the Group’s activities. 
This included updating the Executive 
Committee and Board on Brexit risks and 
initiatives to mitigate the impact from a 
range of possible negotiation outcomes 
that continually changed during the 
transition period while operating under 
the withdrawal agreement until the 24 
December 2020 when the UK/European 
Union Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was 
officially announced. Throughout the EU 
exit process, Drax held Chairmanship of 
the Energy UK trade association Brexit 
Working Group which undertook regular 
meetings attended by various UK 
Government organisations. Post the 
transition period management directly, 
and through its association with Energy 
UK have continued to monitor closely the 
release and interpretation of further 
details relating to the FTA in order that 
we can look to clarify fully the potential 
impacts on our trading operations, supply 
chain and regulatory requirements. The 
Group’s ongoing focus will be to ensure 
that our business mitigates any adverse 
effects to its operations from the FTA 
and it has put in place a number of 
actions and measures to manage risks it 
identified around a number of key areas. 
These included: 
• Considering the Finance and Commodity 
Trading risks from potential restrictions 
in access to financial, carbon, renewable 
energy Guarantee of Origin certificates, 
(GoOs) and commodity markets. 
The Group developed contingency plans 
to respond to the revised approach to 
carbon trading post 1 January 2021 to 
allow it to effectively meet the Group’s 
regulatory requirements relating to 
carbon. There were also preparations to 
ensure the Group’s ability to secure and 
continue to trade renewable energy 
GoOs, as well as operations to manage 
its other financial and commodity 
exposures, such as FX, effectively from 
1 January 2021. The Group is adapting  
to the post FTA environment, particularly 
with close monitoring of the detailed 
implementation of UK Allowances, 
including possible linkage to the EU 
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).
• Considering the people risks from 
potential constraints in free movement 
of people and access to talent. Further 
consideration and planning have been 
placed on Group-wide recruitment and 
retention, talent management and 
succession planning.
• Considering the risks from potential 
import constraints and tariffs on the 
Group’s fuel and critical commodity 
supply. An operational review considered 
alternative port arrangements, a review 
of goods at risk of shortage and planning 
for key plant operations supplies. This 
included engaging with supply chain 
partners to ensure their Brexit readiness 
and managing for increased supply lead 
times. Other potential import risks 
associated with UK Government policy 
arose as a result of Covid-19, where the 
need to give priority to the importing  
of other products such as medicines  
and the closing of French ports to UK 
import and export freight, increased the 
potential to add further congestion and 
delays to the import of critical spares 
and commodities.
• Considering potential changes to 
regulation and policy and the risks from 
loss of engagement with European-
based stakeholders to discuss emerging 
policy and understand potential 
divergence of compliance requirements 
and/or market rules. The Group 
continues to promote the benefits  
of biomass and is engaged with 
government, regulators, and other 
interest groups, both in the UK and 
internationally. This is to ensure our 
views and positions on current and 
forthcoming legislation, regulations, 
energy and environmental policy issues, 
that may have implications for our 
business, are represented and that we 
are able to listen to and consider the 
views of others in helping to reach 
consensus on the future for biomass.
Generally, the overall financial and 
non-financial risk impact to the Group of 
Brexit to date has been minimal. However, 
the above key risk areas still remain  
a focus of the Group. While the UK 
Government continues to develop plans 
to manage the longer-term economic 
effects of Covid-19 there is additionally 
future uncertainty about any additional 
economic effects which may result  
from the implementation of the FTA  
on our customers, suppliers and other 
stakeholders. For these reasons, the 
Group will continue to monitor any 
potential change to Brexit risks during 
2021 as the full interpretation  
and implementation of the FTA takes 
place and where necessary expects to 
update its mitigating actions to minimise 
any effects on business operations.
Principal risk categories
The Group has identified nine principal 
risk categories that it considers having 
material operational impact and 
probability to its business. These and 
other key risks are considered within  
an established programme by which 
management, executive and the Board 
consider how risk and our ability to 
respond to risks evolves. Set out below 
are the principal risks reflecting that 
assessment:
1. Environment, Health and Safety
2. Political and Regulatory
3. Strategic
4. Biomass Acceptability
5. Plant Operations
6. Trading and Commodity
7. Information Systems and Security
8. Climate Change

Covid-19  Impact
Environment, health and safety 
Context
The safety, health and wellbeing of our employees and contractors, wherever they work in respect of the Group’s business,  
is a priority for the business and is vital to the continued success of the Group. We believe that a safe, compliant, and 
sustainable business model is critical to the delivery of our strategy and crucial for sustained long-term performance. 
Safety and environmental management are foundational to our operational philosophy and we continue to work across the 
Group to maintain high standards and a culture of safe working. Compliance with environmental legislation and our 
environmental permits and consents is essential to ensure the long-term future of the business. We have a focus on emerging 
legislation and regulatory changes in both safety and environmental aspects. These are important for our people and our 
reputation and we recognise the value attributed to effective measures and good practices by our stakeholders. 
Risk and impact 
• Our operations involve a range of potential 
hazards to personnel and the environment, 
that arise from the processes we perform 
and the equipment which we use. This 
includes heavy plant and machinery at  
our sites in the US and UK.
• The biomass that we use to generate 
electricity is combustible so the 
production, preparation and transportation 
(whether within our sites or in transit 
between sites) requires careful 
management to minimise the risk of fire  
or explosion.
• We operate various plants at high 
temperatures and pressures, as well as 
requiring a focus on maintaining dam 
integrity, as we generate electricity at 
400kV for transmission onto the  
National Grid.
Covid-19  
• Specific challenges arose and remain 
areas of potential risk with safeguarding 
our employees and contractors. Many  
have been required to fundamentally 
change their day-to-day working, as they 
are expected to work from home to reflect 
UK Government guidelines and also 
management’s assessment of the most 
appropriate way to safeguard the health 
and wellbeing of all of our colleagues. 
Where key workers have been required to 
continue to work on our generation and 
biomass production facilities, actions have 
been required to provide new guidance on 
working practices in response to the 
changes in managing the virus. The 
planned outage at Drax Power Station 
required additional planning, financial 
resources, and management oversight.
Key mitigations 
• Maintaining robust management systems 
designed to mitigate risk.
• Training employees to a high level of 
competence, to appreciate and manage 
environment, health, and safety risks.
• Tracking and reporting events and near 
misses, prompt investigations and timely 
implementation of corrective actions.
• Regular monitoring of processes and 
incidents to identify trends in performance.
• Routine auditing of compliance against 
standards, policy, and procedures.
• A proactive and structured approach to 
supporting the wellbeing of our colleagues, 
by focusing on promoting personal 
resilience and encouraging healthy habits 
for physical wellbeing.
• Engaging with regulators and stakeholders 
to identify improvements to our systems 
and operations.
• Proactive identification of future 
legislation and appropriate investment to 
optimise performance.
• Effective governance framework including 
an executive level Safety, Health, 
Environment and Wellbeing Leadership 
Committee, to oversee governance, review 
and challenge the management of safety, 
health, environment, and wellbeing risks 
across the Group.
• Development of plans for 2021 that align 
all businesses to the key focus areas to 
drive improvement in our HSE 
performance, whilst building upon the 
2019 One Safe Drax vision and aligning 
with our Safe People, Safe Systems & 
Process, and Safety Assurance approach.
• Raising awareness through shared 
experiences of events or near misses with 
colleagues across different sites. This 
includes sharing of videos and interviews 
of those who had first-hand experience of 
the events.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020 
• Personal safety performance for the year 
with TRIR and LTIR continues in line with 
industry benchmarks. 
• Use of a Group-wide reporting tool for 
environment, health and safety incidents.
• Creation of a new role and appointment  
of a Group HSE Director with responsibility  
to drive HSE improvements via a cohesive 
strategy across all our businesses.
• At our Daldowie fuel plant, we have been 
working to deliver sustained improvements 
to our odour minimisation strategy and 
commissioned an upgrade to our 
regenerative thermal oxidiser (RTO).
• We invested in significant upgrades to  
our turbines and associated equipment  
at Drax power station which will result  
in lower carbon emissions and improved 
fuel efficiency.
Covid-19  
• Significant changes were introduced  
to working arrangements with HSE 
leadership’s top priority being, the health 
and wellbeing of all of our colleagues.  
This involved fully supporting all 
employees through that change and 
providing support which focused on 
physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.
• Risk assessments were undertaken at 
each operating site to identify mitigations 
to reduce the likelihood of workplace 
transmission of the virus and to protect 
key workers. All employees except those 
required on operational sites have been 
asked to work from home in line with 
Government’s advice both in the UK and 
US. The Group’s HSE response is adjusted 
according to the continual changing UK 
Government and US authority guidelines.

Covid-19  Impact
Political and regulatory 
Context
We remain alert to changes in Government policy at UK and EU level. The energy sector is subject to detailed legislation and 
regulation that is frequently changing as the economic and industrial trends towards decarbonising and decentralising 
become more exacting. In addition, the wider regulatory and compliance environment applicable to businesses is also 
increasing with growing requirements in transparency and accountability.
Covid-19  
• The increased and ongoing pressures from 
managing the pandemic are impacting UK 
Government priorities and finances, which 
in turn could delay the introduction of 
new legislation to deliver the required 
investment frameworks required to 
support progress in reducing carbon 
emissions and addressing the issues of 
climate change. Such changes could also 
result in reduced Government investment 
in technologies or other activities which 
are essential in enabling aspects of our 
strategy, for example Carbon Capture..
Risk and impact
• Changes to UK Government policy, 
regulations or tariffs may increase the 
costs to operate, reduce operational 
efficiency and affect our ability to realise 
our strategy, which may adversely affect 
our financial and operational performance, 
results and cash flows. Issues include 
reform to legal framework following Brexit; 
data privacy regulation; network access 
and electric charging arrangements; 
environmental regulation; wholesale 
market arrangements including access 
and impacts on liquidity; and consumer 
service and affordability requirements.
• A more complex and challenging 
regulatory environment increases the 
costs to operate, the threat of regulatory 
investigation, the risk of non-compliance, 
and penalties/sanctions. Brexit may create 
further uncertainty and additional costs 
associated with changes in regulatory 
reporting or divergence in compliance 
requirements.
• Biomass represented 75% of our 
generation in 2020 (77% in 2019) and, 
longer term, we are aiming to increase our 
biomass self-supply to five million tonnes 
per annum. The regulatory environment is 
evolving which could increase costs and 
mean anticipated returns are significantly 
lower than expectations. Our ability to 
influence EU requirements on biomass 
acceptability/sustainability may be 
impaired post-Brexit.
• Following the UK’s transition to the EU/UK 
FTA, the UK Government has announced it 
will establish its own ETS. The aim is to link 
the new UK ETS to the EU ETS to ensure 
continued alignment on decarbonisation 
via a market-based pricing regime, 
although this will take time and there is  
no guarantee it will come to fruition. The 
price of carbon under the UK ETS remains 
unknown as the auctioning of allowances 
is not expected to begin until Q2 2021. 
Until that point, UK energy markets are 
likely to use the EU ETS price as a proxy, 
however this is by no means a perfect 
hedge and there is the potential that  
once trading of UK allowances commence 
there could be a number of teething  
issues such as limited market liquidity  
in a smaller market. 
Key mitigations
• Engaging with politicians across the 
political spectrum and Government 
officials, to understand and influence 
perception, and communicate our 
socio-economic value in supporting the 
UK’s ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.
• Working with stakeholders to maintain 
Drax as a thought leader on priority policy 
and regulatory issues.
• Engaging with regulators and industry 
bodies to understand their priorities and 
seek to influence strategic direction of, 
and ensure compliance with, regulatory 
requirements.
• Working with Energy UK to identify market 
improvements, enhance competition and 
develop voluntary codes of practice.
• Maintaining regulatory and compliance 
control frameworks to mitigate the risk of 
non-compliance covering risk assessment; 
policy development; adequate process; 
training; audit; and continual 
improvement.
• Working with leaders and key stakeholders 
in those regions where Drax is seeking to 
evolve its economic impact, to identify 
areas of common purpose and share ideas 
for creating jobs, investment and new 
growth opportunities.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020 
• Overall risk levels heightened as a result of 
increased regulatory intervention within 
the Group’s Generation and Customer 
business and lack of clarity around UK 
Government policy some of which resulted 
from Covid-19 and Brexit.
• The ongoing and drawn out negotiations 
around Brexit during the year and the 
subsequent transition to the UK/EU FTA 
continued to create uncertainty. 
Weakened sterling and difficulties in cross 
border trade can influence fuel costs and/
or lead to financial distress issues with our 
customers. Delays at ports can affect our 
supplies of fuel and components although 
the nature of our dedicated supply chain 
mitigates this risk.
• Many ancillary services require policy, 
regulatory and market change to ensure 
generators are suitably compensated for 
these services.
• The UK Government has introduced a 
price cap for domestic power retailers; we 
remain vigilant to the risk that this could 
be extended to some SMEs.
• The smart meter roll out continues and 
the obligation to install a smart meter  
for every customer by the middle of 2021 
(where reasonable steps have been 
exhausted) will move to fixed annual 
targets thereafter.
• Further failures of small energy suppliers 
(and resulting cost mutualisation across 
the industry).
• The UK Government has confirmed it 
believes that the Carbon Price Support  
is set at approximately the right level, 
although the longer-term level is 
dependent on prevailing commodity prices 
and terms within the UK/EU FTA.
• Ofgem is reviewing the way in which 
network businesses are remunerated and 
user access is procured/costs allocated, 
which will impact the cost base of 
generators and retailers.
Covid-19  
• The financial impact on Government 
funding over the immediate and longer 
term will result in a reassessment of 
investment priorities for this and future 
administrations both in the UK and 
elsewhere which could affect Drax 
business model and financial prospects.
• Ofgem is reviewing the fundamental 
design of the power market in light of  
the impact on balancing costs of Covid-19 
demand-levels (which offer an insight to 
the future supply/demand balance) and 
general efficiency/effectiveness of market 
with increasing proportion of zero 
marginal cost generation.

Strategic 
Context
The Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future, with an ambition to become a carbon negative 
company by 2030. Underpinning the Group’s purpose and ambition are three strategic aims:
1) to build a long-term future for sustainable biomass, 
2) to be the leading provider of power system stability, and 
3) to give all our customers control of their energy.
Through this strategy the Group aims to deliver long-term growth opportunities, including investment in new technologies  
for alternative fuels, which we believe have the potential to support earnings beyond 2027, when the subsidies we receive  
for generating electricity from biomass are curtailed.
Additionally, the Group aims to deliver higher quality, diversified and sustainable earnings, whilst also supporting the UK’s 
ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.
Risk and impact
Strategic risks are defined as those that 
could materially undermine any of the 
Group’s strategic aims.
Sustainable biomass
Building a long-term future for sustainable 
biomass requires the achievement of an 
economically sustainable level of fuel cost 
relative to other energy sources. A primary 
objective is to increase biomass self-supply 
to five million tonnes per annum and reduce 
the cost of generation to £50 per MWh by 
2027 to achieve and sustain an economic 
level of cost for sustainable biomass 
generation.
• There is a risk to the availability of feasible 
expansion opportunities and the successful 
identification and delivery of initiatives to 
reduce the current cost of biomass.
• Irrespective of the economics of 
sustainable biomass there is a risk that 
biomass is not accepted either in the UK 
or in other jurisdictions as a renewable 
source of energy. Growth opportunities, 
investment and innovation into new 
technologies required to further improve 
the economics and carbon reduction 
potential of sustainable biomass could 
therefore all be limited.
System stability
The power market in which we operate 
continues to evolve and with it the 
requirements for system stability products, 
new technology solutions and the market 
to procure them. To be a leading provider  
of system stability, we need to build the 
right portfolio of assets and associated 
business models.
To enable us to build the right portfolio  
of assets and associated business models 
to achieve our aim, it is important that  
the market values flexibility and system 
services at the right economic levels,  
and procures those services through 
mechanisms that we are able to participate 
in effectively.
• There is a risk that the market does not 
value flexibility and system services at the 
right economic levels or procures those 
services through mechanisms that we  
are not able to participate in effectively.
• There is a risk that unexpected changes  
to electricity supply and demand could 
reduce electricity demand and volatility, 
and therefore limit the market for system 
stability products. 
Customer Control
Drax aims to enable all its business 
customers to decarbonise their energy 
sources and control energy use and cost. 
• The Customers business needs to 
compete profitably in all the customer 
segments it serves. As the market evolves, 
there is a risk that the economic viability of 
the Customers business is undermined by 
changes in market operations and rules, or 
an emerging mismatch in some segments 
between Drax’s aim and services and the 
requirements of the customer.
Capital
Delivering any one of the strategic aims 
requires the ability to access and 
effectively allocate the capital required 
while maintaining a corporate credit rating 
in the BB range.
• There is a risk that investor sentiment 
moves away from Drax and its strategic 
direction. This could happen if for example 
sustainable biomass becomes unattractive, 
or Drax allocates capital poorly and 
underperforms. 
Key Mitigations
Sustainable biomass
• Adoption of an integrated plan to expand 
biomass self-supply capability, reduce  
the cost of sustainable biomass to an 
economically sustainable level and 
develop innovative approaches to fuels. 
Allocation of c. £600 million with rigorous 
tracking and reporting on cost reduction 
achieved.
• Drax is a pro-active advocate for 
sustainable biomass. An Independent 
Advisory Board is tasked to challenge our 
science-based approach and assumptions 
on sustainable biomass and publish their 
recommendations.
System stability
• We maintain and invest into a central 
Group market modelling capability and 
embed it into planning and option 
assessment and test/cross check against 
third party scenarios.
• Continually evaluate a) the current  
and projected performance of our own 
portfolio of assets, and b) the value gained 
from changing the composition of the 
asset portfolio to better fulfil a strategy  
in line with the Group’s view of the  
market outlook.
Customer control
• The Customers business introduced  
a programme to reshape the customer 
portfolio in 2020, including emphasising 
growth in the customer segments aligned 
to Drax’s purpose. 
• The organisation includes a new growth 
unit from which Drax branded electric 
vehicles and electric assets propositions 
were launched to support decarbonisation 
and control of customers’ energy.
Capital
• We continue to run a full investor  
relations programme, covering equity  
and debt markets. 
• The Group has evolved further its 
approach to capital allocation. This 
provides rigour and consistency in 
assessing the technical, financial, and 
strategic justification of new projects 
across the Group, in particular for 
investments in new and emerging 
technologies.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• The Brexit negotiations during the year 
and subsequent transition to  
the UK/EU FTA had a relatively immaterial 
impact on the Group’s strategic aims.
• The disposal of the Group’s CCGT portfolio 
announced on 15 December 2020, which 
completed on 31 January 2021, combined 
with our commitment to close the coal 
generation assets, delivers a fully 
renewable generation portfolio for system 
services. However, it reduces the assets 
available to provide system flexibility.

Covid-19  Impact
Strategic continued  
• Markets for system stability continue 
evolving, with the introduction of the  
new ESO market for synchronous 
compensation. The Group bid successfully 
for a contract for Cruachan and will watch 
to see how the market evolves.
• Experience from the Group’s €250 million 
bond issue indicates that demand exists 
for “green” investment, and with it a view 
that the strategic risk for access to capital 
is not currently high.
Covid-19  
• Demand for electricity fell in the 
Customers business and some customers 
experienced financial distress. Therefore, 
focus shifted during 2020 from the 
delivery of strategic aims to managing the 
impact.
• There was a slowdown in the delivery  
of the Government agenda on the 
environment, with a delay to COP26  
and the publication of a white paper  
on Energy.
• However, publications such as from  
the Committee on Climate Change and 
the Government indicate a growing 
commitment to bioenergy carbon capture 
and storage (BECCS), and with it 
acknowledgement that sustainable 
biomass is seen as an accepted part  
of the UK’s future.
Biomass acceptability 
Context
Sustainability legislation at EU and UK level, as well as in other countries in which we operate and where we source biomass, in 
addition to public understanding of the benefits of the supply chain and technology is evolving. Attitudes to the benefits of 
biomass as a renewable source may not align with our strategy and investment case, which may impact our plans and mean 
that actual returns differ from those we expected. Brexit introduced new risks as the ability of the UK to influence future EU 
policy on biomass sustainability requirements is likely to reduce and there is the potential for policy divergence which might 
make our operations and obligations more complex and costly.
Risk and impact
• Sustainability policy changes on the 
sourcing and use of biomass in the UK, EU 
or other countries in which we operate or 
from which we source biomass could be 
unworkable and make it difficult for us to 
comply with policy requirements or 
adversely affect our ability to claim subsidy 
in support of economic biomass 
generation. Changes in policy could 
increase costs, make it difficult to source 
biomass, or reduce the current support  
for the benefits of biomass.
• Detractors and some environmental 
non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) 
may influence policymakers against 
biomass use resulting in reduced support 
for the benefits of biomass.
• Being outside the EU may reduce the UK’s 
influence on biomass acceptability and 
future sustainability requirements, 
potentially leading to multiple compliance 
requirements (policy divergence).
Key mitigations
• Increased transparency in how we 
evidence sustainability.
• Working with academics, think tanks  
and specialist consultants to improve 
understanding and analysis of the benefits 
of biomass.
• Engaging with key eNGOs to discuss 
issues of contention.
• Forging closer relationships with suppliers 
on sustainability through the supplier 
relationship programme.
• Maintaining strong processes to ensure 
compliance with regulation.
• Increased engagement across all 
European Institutions (Commission, 
Parliament, Council), and relevant UK 
Government departments.
• Developing and maintaining strong 
relationships with policymakers.
• Continued engagement within our supply 
chain to ensure compliance with prevailing 
regulations and standards, as well as 
opportunities to enhance actions which 
support sustainable and responsible 
sourcing strategies and bio-diversity  
which is integral to our philosophy.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• BEIS has announced it will create a new 
bioenergy strategy that will be published 
in 2022, reassessing the role of biomass  
in the context of achieving net zero.
• Evidencing of our forest biomass sourcing 
commitments.
• The Independent Advisory Board (IAB)  
of scientists, and leaders in the field of 
sustainability providing impartial advice 
and guidance operated throughout 2020.
• The EU has confirmed it will review several 
relevant pieces of legislation including the 
EU ETS, LULUCF, REDII – potentially giving 
rise to policy changes and some possible 
divergence in sustainability criteria 
between the UK and Europe.
• Any tightening of reductions in GHG 
emissions targets in Europe and increased 
number of commitments to coal phase out 
among EU Member States provides the 
opportunity to supply new markets with 
sustainable biomass.
Covid-19  
• The UK Government discussions on policy 
changes have continued. Indications are 
that as part of the wider economic 
recovery plans, UK Government will bring 
forward and have a greater focus on its 
sustainability policies.

Plant operations 
 
Context
The reliability of our operating plants both in the UK and the US is critical to our ability to create value for the Group. Some  
of our plants are old, for example, Drax Power Station was built approximately fifty years ago and our hydro plants nearly  
one hundred years ago. The plants and production facilities are highly complex and require careful management to operate, 
with many required to run flexibly and promptly to respond to the demands of the electricity system. For Drax Power Station 
specifically, the plant was originally constructed to generate electricity from coal, and we have converted four of the six units 
to use biomass, rather than the fuel for which they were originally designed.
Risk and impact
• As plant ages, the operational reliability 
and integrity could reduce. Single or multi 
point failures of plant across our portfolio, 
and incidents arising from the handling 
and combustion of biomass, could result  
in forced outages in our generation or 
pellet production plants.
• Successful generation using biomass 
requires stringent quality to be maintained 
throughout our pellet production plants 
and the supply chain, which continues  
to evolve and mature. Our suppliers may 
experience operational or financial 
difficulties which impair their ability to 
sustain continued compliance or result  
in inadequate standards being met. Poor 
quality could result in additional costs  
(as we may be required to source material 
from other suppliers) or inadequate 
volume of materials, leading to loss of 
generation which could adversely affect 
financial performance and results.
• Brexit could impede the future availability 
and delivery of materials or parts longer 
term or increase our costs to operate in 
securing such items.
Covid-19  
• Given ongoing uncertainty over the timing 
and availability of measures to support a 
return to more normal working patterns  
it is unclear whether future planned or 
unplanned events at our sites could incur 
additional costs or delays in execution 
which could impact operational 
performance and/or future financial 
results. The pandemic has impacted the 
financial and operational performance  
of many businesses. The prolonged period  
of such impacts could result in businesses  
on which Drax relies failing or being 
restricted in their ability to deliver products 
or services as we might normally expect. 
This could have further impact in the 
event we suffer interruptions or forced 
outages or increase our costs to operate 
where we need to find alternative 
suppliers or business partners.
Key mitigations
• Implementing a comprehensive plant 
investment and maintenance programme, 
that is risk-based and reflects the 
challenges of operating complex 
equipment, some of which is old, 
supported by engineering excellence.
• Ensuring plant is designed to prevent  
and control major hazards.
• Maintaining robust management systems, 
designed to identify and mitigate risk.
• Maintaining the stringent safety 
procedures in place for handling biomass 
and dust management.
• Managing the plant as a portfolio to 
ensure losses are minimised.
• Undertaking significant research and 
development on the production of wood 
pellets, as well as the handling and burning 
of biomass.
• Full testing of all biomass supplies prior  
to acceptance, and the use of contractual 
rights to reject out of specification 
cargoes.
• Sampling and analysis through the supply 
chain, to increase understanding of causes 
of fuel quality issues.
• Maintaining insurance in place to cover 
losses from plant failure where possible.
• Employing advanced condition monitoring 
systems to alert any possible plant failures 
before they occur where practicable.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• Completion of a significant planned 
maintenance outage on Unit 3 at  
Drax Power Station with installation  
of a new high-pressure turbine unit  
and replacement hot reheat pipework  
and upgraded unit control system.
• Planned maintenance outages across  
the hydro and CCGT fleet which included 
major overhauls of the gas turbine at 
Damhead Creek and steam turbines  
at both Damhead Creek and Shoreham.
• Baton Rouge rail chambering yard fully 
commissioned.
Covid-19  
• The risks for the potential to lose 
production time as a result of key 
operational employees being affected  
by the pandemic increased. The Group 
continues to operate all of its plants in line 
with the latest UK Government and US 
authorities’ guidelines whilst protecting 
the safety of its employees and sub-
contractors. The measures implemented 
by management to address the increased 
risks resulted in additional costs and 
challenges associated with the 2020 
outages across our generating assets and 
in particular the planned outage of Unit 3 
at Drax Power Station.

Trading and commodity 
Context
Sales of power and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) represented £1,699 million (2019: £1,857 million) of our revenue 
from continuing operations in 2020 in our Generation business and our Customers business made sales of £2,119 million (2019: 
£2,226 million) of electricity and gas.
The margins derived from our Power Generation and Customers businesses are influenced by the liquidity of the commodity 
markets and our ability to secure desired prices in a volatile market. Non-commodity costs are also volatile and inherently 
difficult to hedge.
The income value derived through the generation of ROC’s was £490 million (2019: £528 million). The value which we derive 
from ROC’s can change from that of prior years and our future forecasts.
Risk and impact
• Liquidity and volatility in trading 
conditions and unexpected changes in 
commodity prices could result in lower 
margins and a reduction in cash flow  
in our Generation business.
• Delivery of commercial value from the 
flexibility of our portfolio and leveraging  
a complicated supply chain with uncertain 
running regimes requires effective 
execution of our trading strategy and 
opportunities to trade being available  
in a liquid market.
• The Generation business may fail to 
secure future system support services 
contracts which are a source of revenue 
diversity for the Group, amounting to £118 
million in 2020.
• The value of ROCs generated may be 
lower than forecast, for example if the 
recycle value outturns are below our 
projections due to higher than anticipated 
renewable generation.
• Supplier failures continue to lead to 
supplier mutualisation processes being 
invoked (whereby their costs and 
commitments are shared among other 
suppliers), notably for ROCs, resulting in 
increased costs, albeit this level is capped.
Key mitigations
• Ensuring high levels of forward power 
sales for 2021 to 2023 and the Contract 
for Difference for the one biomass 
generation unit reduces our exposure  
to volatility.
• Operating three biomass units under  
a single ROC cap for Drax Power Station 
provides increased opportunities for 
greater flexibility of generation and to  
add additional value.
• Additional value is provided through the 
increased flexibility and optimisation 
capabilities provided by Drax’s hydro assets.
• Customers’ energy supply and commodity 
price exposures for fixed price sales are 
hedged with third parties where necessary.
• Purchasing wood pellets under long-term 
contracts with fixed pricing increases 
price certainty over extended periods. 
• Engaging with wood pellet suppliers to 
ensure delivery schedules are met and any 
shortfalls addressed to limit the impact on 
power generation.
• Hedging fluctuations in ROC generation 
from wind farms through weather 
derivatives.
• The value of the Group’s ROC production is 
hedged by selling ROCs to the Customers 
supply business and other counterparties. 
This is supplemented by assessing 
opportunities to mitigate Recycle Fund 
volatility and analysing possible outturns.
• Significant hedging of forward foreign 
exchange (see pages 206 and 223 for 
more details).
• Coal stocks are being managed for 
remaining commercial operations and 
Capacity Market obligations.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• Sterling exchange rates against the US 
Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Euro have been 
volatile due to uncertainty surrounding 
Covid-19, Brexit and the US elections.
• Power prices across 2020 were generally 
lower than previous years with low market 
liquidity and increased volatility in 
short-term prices.
• Depressed wood pellet prices due to 
planned and unplanned outages across 
the industry. This limits Drax’s ability to 
mitigate any unplanned outage due to its 
scale of biomass generation in the market.
• The replacement of the EU ETS following 
Brexit is a risk that the business continues 
to monitor with mitigations planned for 
the current scenarios outlined by the  
UK Government.
• Brexit and the subsequent transition  
to the UK/EU FTA continues to create 
uncertainty in regulation within the UK as  
well as power interconnectivity between 
Europe and the UK.
Covid-19  
• The potential bad debt risk increased as  
a result of the impact to the markets and 
the economy. The Group continues to 
hedge commodity and foreign exchange 
exposures on a long-term basis protecting 
against any near-term volatility in prices 
and hedges energy supply to provide 
support to its energy customers.

Information systems and security 
  
 
Context
Our IT systems and data are essential to supporting the delivery of the day-to-day business operations of the Group and make 
sure our financial, legal, regulatory and compliance obligations are met. Our systems must also evolve in order to contribute  
to the delivery of our strategy. The systems need to be fit for purpose and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the 
systems and data needs to be ensured.
Risk and impact
• Any absence or delay to the 
implementation of key IT systems 
transformation affects our ability to  
deliver our strategy and results in 
additional unforeseen costs.
• Reduced performance or reduced 
availability of IT systems, data and facilities 
affecting our operations adversely. For 
example, interrupting supply of electricity 
or impeding the accurate recording of 
electricity supplied to and used by our 
customers.
• Security compromise of our systems  
and data including personal data; causing 
operational and financial impact and 
regulatory non-compliance.
Key mitigations
• Maintaining and refreshing business 
continuity, disaster recovery and crisis 
management plans.
• Maintaining effective and up-to-date 
cyber security measures, including a 
protect, detect, respond and recover 
strategy, which evolve to address known 
new or potential threats.
• Implementing a Group IT Strategy and 
identifying key projects to deliver 
Group-wide services, improving security, 
resilience and performance. The IT Board,  
a sub-committee of the Executive 
Committee, provides oversight and 
governance.
• Periodic external assessment of the 
integrity and adequacy of our IT and cyber 
security arrangements which are assessed 
and challenged by subject matter experts, 
as well as the Board and Audit Committee.
• Scenario events in which we assess our 
capability to respond to potential 
circumstances or threats.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• The enforcement of key compliance 
regulations such as the NIS Directive, 
which is ongoing, have increased the 
potential financial cost to the business.
• Work continued on integrating hydro and 
gas asset systems where it was applicable 
to do so.
• Further work embedding the IT operating 
model has been undertaken to better 
support strategic objectives of the Group 
and improve efficiency of technology 
processes.
• Ongoing programme of improvement  
to security, monitoring of key IT controls 
and IT and security risk management.
• A formalised and approved new Target 
Architecture which enables us to deliver 
the IT systems and capabilities flexibly  
and in support of business needs.
Covid-19  
• There continued to be a manageable 
impact on the delivery timelines of a 
number of planned IT activities, driven  
by the availability of resources and other 
priorities to ensure the business remained 
operational. The adoption of new 
technology and changes in existing IT 
systems was necessary to facilitate the 
safe home working for many of the Group’s 
employees and has helped to improve the 
IT environment.

Climate Change 
 
Context
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C as early as 2030,  
causing changes in the climate system with associated impacts. It is important we assess the impact of climate change  
on our business and our preparedness to manage risks related to both the physical impacts of climate change and the 
transition to a low carbon economy.
Risk and impact
• Physical impacts of climate change to our 
operations include increased incidence 
and severity of extreme weather events, 
such as drought and heavy rainfall, that 
may impact production. Hurricanes have 
increased in frequency and intensity in the 
US Gulf, which can disrupt our business 
and supply chain. For example, heavy 
rainfall affected our US Pellet Production 
business and third-party pellet mill 
sourcing areas in the winter of 2019. 
Severe rainfall in the UK also resulted in 
significant flooding to areas surrounding 
our Drax Power Station in early 2020 
which affected the ability of people and 
materials to reach site for a short period.
• Policy risks related to the transition to a 
low carbon economy include UK 
Government changes in climate policy 
that may impact generation, such as 
unabated gas generation. Future revisions 
to greenhouse gas accounting 
methodologies have the potential to 
impact biomass generation.
• Technology risks related to the transition 
to a low carbon economy include 
technology and innovation not developing 
as expected, impacting delivery of the 
Group’s carbon negative ambition and 
business strategy.
• Reputation and market risks related to  
the transition to a low carbon economy 
include increased activity by NGOs,  
the potential for reduced investor and 
customer confidence, delays to our 
strategy (for example more stringent 
qualifying regimes or approval processes 
linked to developing existing or new 
facilities) and challenges with employee 
recruitment and retention.
Key mitigations
• Sourcing from a wide geographical range 
of third-party pellet mills.
• US Pellet Production business has 
developed stockpiles to alleviate 
incidences of wet weather-related 
production interruption.
• Aspects of the physical impacts of climate 
change on new installations are addressed 
under planning laws.
• Working with Energy UK on a framework 
to better manage the physical impacts of 
climate change on thermal generating 
facilities.
• Modelling of reservoir spillway capacities 
at Cruachan Dam, to understand capacity 
for extreme weather events. Robust 
business strategy informed by net zero 
2050 scenario.
• Establishment of a carbon negative 
ambition and a Climate Policy, 
underpinning a business strategy 
consistent with UK Government climate 
change policy.
• Engagement with stakeholders, including 
close liaison with UK Government, on 
future policies.
• Diversification of generation portfolio  
with acquisition completed in 2018.
• Strong innovation team tracking 
technology advances and developing  
new technologies such as BECCS.
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• Short-term interruption to fibre production 
at our LaSalle Pellet Production plant 
during the year caused primarily by adverse 
weather conditions in the US in 2020.
• Ongoing development and review of 
external greenhouse gas corporate 
accounting and reporting guidance, 
frameworks, and standards.
• Publication and implementation of  
a new Climate Policy for the Group.
• Completion of work by Strathclyde 
University to understand the potential 
changes in long-term weather patterns at 
Cruachan Dam. Results show that current 
predicted extremes are manageable.
Covid-19  
• The economic recovery plans that are 
starting to emerge indicate the UK 
Government will use the opportunity to 
bring forward policy and actions that help 
drive corporate focus on sustainability and 
climate change action.

People 
 
Context
We need to ensure we have an agile and inclusive working environment where people from diverse backgrounds and 
experience are enabled to connect, develop, and succeed both in their own careers as well as in the delivery of objectives 
which support the Group’s strategy. We believe recruiting, empowering and retaining the right people in place with the 
leadership, management, specialist skills and engagement is critical in the delivery of strategic plans now and in the future. 
Risk and impact
• Our performance and the delivery of  
our strategy is dependent upon having 
high-quality, suitably experienced 
employees and engaged colleagues at  
all levels of the organisation reflecting  
the diversity in wider society.
• Whilst we continue to invest in our people, 
including supporting them in the 
development of their capabilities through 
training and development programmes, we 
may be unable to recruit and retain people 
with the necessary skills and experience 
which could in turn affect our ability to 
execute our strategy. Examples include 
our ability to recruit people supporting 
work on new technologies such as BECCS 
and alternative fuels and the expansion  
of our biomass facilities in the US.
• The Group is undertaking significant 
change associated with implementing  
our strategy and improving operational 
effectiveness. Examples include the 
closure of our Coal generating assets and 
also changes to our operations where we 
generate electricity as we transition to 
alternative viable fuels.
Key mitigations
• Conducting a comprehensive and 
systematic assessment of our talent  
and succession plan. 
• Implementing consistent Group-wide 
performance management, potential 
assessment, and career development 
frameworks.
• Providing workforce engagement forums 
enabling colleagues and management to 
communicate, share ideas and views on 
any business-related issues, gain feedback 
and explore opportunities for new ways  
of working such as our Fit for the Future 
programme.
• Conducting regular colleague surveys to 
monitor engagement levels and alignment 
of people with Group values (you can read 
more about this on page 61).
• Continued investment employees personal 
and career development to enhance 
business performance and provide the 
Group with a relevant pipeline of talent in 
critical roles.
• Ensuring regular colleague 
communications, and involvement in the 
business through our MyVoice Forums 
(more information on the work in these 
areas in 2020 can be found on pages 61).
• Maintaining reward packages that aid 
recruitment and retention.
• A diversity and inclusion strategy that 
aligns to our organisational vision and 
goals (you can read more about our work 
in this area on pages 60).
• Engaging our colleagues with defining the 
behaviours that sit behind our Values (you 
can read more about our work in this area 
on pages 58 and 59).
Changes in factors impacting risk in 2020
• During the year, the Group’s focus on 
implementing its HR strategy has 
mitigated various risks and lessened the 
probability and impact of the overall 
people risk category. The Group is aware 
that, as it manages the wider context  
of rapidly changing people risks, the  
HR strategy will need to remain agile  
to address anticipated increases to 
probability and impact in the short-term. 
• We reviewed our HR strategy and 
reshaped our priorities putting together  
a comprehensive five-year HR plan 
centred around:
 1.  developing our HR foundations  
to enable the organisation to be 
efficiently fit for the future. 
 2.  raising business performance and 
building organisational capability 
through the empowerment of  
our people.
 3.  continuing to develop and improve to  
be best in class for people leadership.
 4.  supporting the delivery of Drax plans, 
purpose, and operational excellence  
as part of business as usual.
 5.  ongoing development of our 
workforce engagement forums.
 6.  making the organisational and people 
changes to align with ‘fit for the  
future’ thinking, driving consistency, 
efficiencies, improvements in decision 
making and reduction in cost.
Covid-19  
• There has been a wide change in working 
practices in particular for office-based 
employees. Management continues to 
provide an increased focus on “keeping 
our people safe” within business continuity 
planning throughout the pandemic, 
through increased communications and 
wellbeing activity, community activity, and 
making appropriate policy changes.

It’s exciting to be part of  
Drax as we step up our  
efforts to lead on biomass 
sustainability standards, to 
positively contribute to the 
climate change agenda, and 
to be a force for good in the

Our Values
• We care about what matters
• We are a can-do kind of place
• We see things differently
• We listen carefully
• We do what we say we will do
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present our Corporate 
Governance Report.
2020 has created many new challenges 
for companies large and small, and 
society as a whole. Drax responded to  
the impact of Covid-19, whilst also 
working to maintain well managed and 
properly conducted day-to-day activities. 
In other sections of the annual report,  
we have explained aspects of our 
response to the pandemic, underpinned 
by a clear priority to keep our employees 
safe, support their wellbeing and enable 
them to adjust to new ways of working. 
Informed by our values – of caring about 
what matters – we have also worked  
hard to put into place support for our 
colleagues, wider communities, 
customers and partners. Alongside this, 
we have remained focused on our 
business performance, prospects and 
resilience – to continue the delivery  
of our strategy throughout 2020 and  
for the longer term, in conjunction with 
maintaining transparency and clarity in 
our reporting to shareholders, business 
partners, Government and employees. 
Our strong governance framework, 
culture and values have played a critical 
part in enabling us to respond to the 
pandemic and its economic and social 
impact in conjunction with safeguarding 
the business imperatives which underpin 
long-term sustainable value creation. As 
part of the Critical National Infrastructure 
our work has never been more important, 
and I am immensely proud of the 
outstanding work of our employees 
across the Group, as they adjusted to

their home and working lives in ways that 
would have seemed unimaginable before 
the pandemic. They have risen to the 
challenge of supporting the safety of 
fellow employees and loved ones, whilst 
continuing to focus on running the 
business. Working together, they have 
provided the energy and critical system 
support services that the country needs 
to keep the lights on and to power 
industry and businesses. 
Covid-19 and the Board’s response 
The Drax Board adapted to the changing 
ways of operating in response to the 
pandemic. Deploying online video 
conferencing, the Board held additional 
meetings throughout April, May and June 
to oversee management’s response and 
understand the impact on employees, 
customers, suppliers and business 
partners. These meetings were attended 
by the Executive Committee, together 
with key members of senior management 
as necessary. Each meeting started with 
a report on our employees, focusing  
on the measures taken to protect key 
workers at operational sites, and how  
the Company was implementing home 
working arrangements where possible. 
The report also provided updates on the 
wellbeing of employees as they adapted 
to changes in their lives and working 
practices. The Board also oversaw the 
operational response to continuing to 
deliver the Group’s key objectives during 
the pandemic. You can read more about 
this on page 88. 
The Board has been kept appraised  
of the measures being taken and 
appreciates the open and honest 
discussions with management and the 
collegiate response to the pandemic.  
The way the business has performed 
during this period is a testament to the 
strength of the organisational structures 
and the commitment and hard work  
of employees at all levels. It is also a 
testament to the strong sense of shared 
purpose and values and I am delighted 
that our 2020 workforce engagement 
survey has seen our engagement score 
improve during the pandemic. You can 
read more about this on page 61.
Engaging with our stakeholders 
2020 demonstrated the importance  
of effective engagement with all 
stakeholders, and of ensuring the Board 
has a good understanding of how 
prevailing issues and potential decisions 
might impact those stakeholders. During 
the year, we continued to deliver our 
investor relations programme and, before 
the Covid-19 lockdown, we hosted site 
visits for investors and analysts at Drax 
Power Station, which included 
discussions on our sustainability 
objectives. We also hosted meetings  
to discuss our work with BECCS, and  
to meet our Chief Innovation Officer.  
Our Head of Climate Change and Head  
of Investor Relations attended an ESG 
conference where we discussed carbon 
abatement, coal closure and biomass 
sustainability.
Due to constraints on holding face-to-
face meetings, the CEO, CFO and Head of 
Investor Relations engaged with existing 
shareholders and new investors primarily 
via phone calls and video calls. Key areas 
of discussion were our biomass strategy, 
biomass sustainability, the role of system 
support services, the future potential for 
gas and progress with BECCS. Reflecting 
increasing interest in new technologies 
aimed at reducing carbon emissions, we 
have conducted and participated in a 
number of presentations and seminars  
on negative emissions and the role of Drax. 
In addition to our full and half-year results 
we issued a trading update in April (an 
early stage in the pandemic), in which  
we set out our expectations for the 
Group. These included quantifying the 
anticipated financial impact of Covid-19 
and re-affirming our sustainable and 
growing dividend policy. Our assessment 
of the potential impact from Covid-19 
remained consistent throughout 2020 
with that initial report.
Reflecting feedback from investors and 
the 2019 investor perceptions study 
conducted by Makinson Cowell, we have 
continued to develop our programme  
of ESG reporting and engagement.  
This includes developing our reporting 
towards the disclosure requirements  
for the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we 
incorporate in this year’s annual report  
on pages 32 and 33. 
As mentioned above, our employees  
play a critical part in the success of our 
business and delivering our strategy. 
Throughout 2020 our CEO, Will Gardiner, 
and I met quarterly with the chairs of the 
MyVoice workforce engagement forums. 
Each meeting featured an agenda of 
proposed topics, which were previewed 
in advance with the attendees. For 
example, the meeting in September had a 
presentation on the whistleblowing 
resources available to employees. In June, 
Nicola Hodson, who is a Non-Executive 
Director and Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee gave a presentation on the 
Remuneration Policy and the approach 
being taken to reflect that policy in 
Group-wide reward. 
We also identified particular topics  
which allow attendees to consult with 
employees and report to the meeting on 
feedback. In turn, Will Gardiner and I have 
been able to have discussions about the 
Group’s response to Covid-19, including 
how such events have informed our 
strategy and purpose. We have also 
offered feedback and expressed our 
appreciation for how our people have 
contributed to these matters. There is 
additional information about the MyVoice 
forums on pages 61 and 92, and more 
about our stakeholder engagement, 
 and the factors we consider in decision-
making, on pages 90 and 91.
Culture and governance 
We are proud of our culture at Drax and  
it is this culture that drives our values.  
A fundamental element is acting with 
integrity – what we call, doing the right 
thing. The Board and I seek to set a  
clear and positive tone from the top  
to promote these principles, which in  
turn drive standards and practices in  
all aspects of our work. 
In 2020, we asked our colleagues from 
across the business to articulate their 
thoughts about the essence of Drax and 
what they believe sets us apart. Our five 
values – We care about what matters;  
We are a can-do kind of place; We see 
things differently; We listen carefully and 
We do what we say we will do – describe 
what employees felt amounted to the 
Drax experience. You can read more 
about this on pages 58 and 59. 
The Board and management promote 
openness and a collaborative culture 
across the Group. Our people are 
respected irrespective of their 
background, are enabled to realise their 
potential, and contribute to delivering  
our purpose and strategy. We have 
always placed, and will continue to place, 
particular emphasis on the safety and 
wellbeing of our people. The Group’s 
response to Covid-19 highlighted the 
deep-rooted sense of caring at all levels, 
as the business sought to support 
employees and wider stakeholders.  
 
Informed by our values –  
of caring about what matters 
– we worked hard to put  
into place support for our 
colleagues, wider communities, 
customers and partners.”

Corporate Governance Report: Letter from the Chair continued
From discussions in the Boardroom, to 
conversations with the MyVoice forums, 
to local initiatives, we have sought to 
understand and respond to the 
challenges and needs of others. You can 
read more about our culture and values 
on pages 58 to 63.
In a normal year, we would aim to hold 
Board meetings at different locations and 
meet local employees and management 
in person. However, this has not been 
possible in 2020. The Board discussed 
this challenge in late spring and 
considered how we might achieve 
meaningful engagement without direct 
contact. We decided to prepare video 
messages from the Non-Executive 
Directors, providing an opportunity  
for them to share information about 
themselves and discuss matters they  
are passionate about. 
Nicola Hodson recorded a video and 
wrote a letter to all employees to 
introduce herself. She explained the  
role of the Remuneration Committee and 
how pay in the wider workforce is linked 
to executive pay, and emphasised her 
commitment to diversity and inclusion. 
Launched in August, Nicola’s video 
received over 1,200 views on the Group’s 
intranet. At our September meeting with 
the MyVoice forum chairs we sought 
feedback and reaction to the video and 
letter. Following positive feedback, John 
Baxter also recorded a video to discuss 
one of his key areas of focus; health and 
safety. This was launched in December. 
The Board has been very pleased with  
the feedback received and, in 2021, we 
hope to build on this approach as one 
aspect of ongoing engagement with  
the workforce. We will continue to seek 
new and innovative ways to engage  
with the workforce both in person,  
which we very much hope can return  
to normal, and remotely.
Diversity
The Board is committed to building a 
supportive, diverse and inclusive working 
environment where everyone can be 
themselves. This is a regular topic of 
discussion at our Executive Committee 
and Board meetings. In 2017 we set a 
target to increase female representation 
in senior leadership roles across the 
Group to 40% by the end of 2020. We 
have not yet progressed as intended –  
at December 2020, 29% of our senior 
leadership workforce (our top four career 
levels) was female, with 31.5% females in 
the total workforce – however during 
2020, the Board challenged management 
on the work required to improve in this 
area and to commit the necessary 
resources and time to make more 
impactful progress. This has included 
expanding the coverage of our inclusion 
work to cover broader aspects of diversity. 
Will Gardiner is an active member of  
the POWERful Women “Energy Leaders 
Coalition”, which is committed to driving 
meaningful change in gender diversity  
in the energy sector. As part of this,  
Will took part in the POWERful Women 
conference in October and spoke at a 
panel of CEOs about diversity in Drax. 
The Board recognises that diversity  
goes beyond gender. In July 2020, our 
Executive Committee participated in  
a workshop led by Dan Robertson from 
Vercida Consulting. Those attending 
considered in depth how, through the 
personal commitment of our executive 
team, Drax can deliver change in all areas 
of diversity. 
We are working to support action  
across the wider organisation, and Dan 
Robertson also attended and presented 
to our leadership team of 50 senior 
managers in December. These discussions 
are one part of enabling change through 
engagement with our wider workforce. 
We have taken a number of measures, 
including sharing information on our 
intranet about the value Drax places in 
enabling and supporting diversity. We 
have also reviewed our recruitment 
policies and practices, and the associated 
training for managers and leaders, and 
developed a new Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy. We launched this across the Group 
in September 2020, as part of our new 
Code of Conduct. You can read more 
about our diversity and inclusion activities 
on pages 60 and 95. 
We regularly engage with our workforce 
through our annual survey and quarterly 
voice forums, as well as individual 
conversations, to understand how we 
can enable change. The feedback from 
our employees has been very positive  
to the steps we are taking, and their 
continued support and commitment  
to change will be important in realising 
our objectives.
We see this as a long-term programme 
across the organisation, enabled by short 
and medium-term objectives that have 
been considered by the Board. During 
2021, the Board will assess and challenge 
management on the objectives as part  
of ensuring meaningful progress.
Board changes
In April 2020, Andy Koss stepped down 
from the Board after four years as an 
Executive Director and 15 years with  
the Group. I would like to thank Andy  
for his valuable service over this time.  
He has made a major contribution to  
the transformation of Drax into a  
leading generator and supplier of 
renewable energy.
During the year, the Board approved  
the re-appointments for a second term  
of three years for both David Nussbaum, 
Senior Independent Director, and Nicola 
Hodson, Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. Also in 2020, and following  
a rigorous formal review led by our  
Senior Independent Director, the Board 
confirmed its support for my continuing 
as a Non-Executive Director and Chair  
for a further (and final) three-year term. 
You can find more information on that 
review on page 96.
I am grateful for the continued support 
from my Board colleagues as we move 
forward in delivering on our purpose  
and strategy. You can find out more 
about each of these re-appointments  
in the Nomination Committee Report  
on page 94.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018 (Code)
A revised Code, which can be found on the Financial  
Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk, took effect  
from 1 January 2019. 
Reports on how Drax, the Board and its Committees had 
satisfied the Principles and Provisions of the Code were 
considered formally at two meetings during 2020. The meetings 
included discussions about the steps being taken and how  
they might evolve in 2020, the effectiveness of employee 
engagement, and how the Board assesses, monitors and 
constructively influences culture. The actions taken in 
addressing recommendations from the most recently 
completed externally-led performance evaluation were also 
discussed. It is the Board’s view that the Company applied  
the principles and complied in full with the provisions of  
the Code during 2020.

Corporate Governance Report: Executive Committee
Role of the Executive Committee
The Executive Committee focuses on the 
delivery of the Group’s strategy, financial 
structure, planning and performance, 
organisational development, and the 
delivery of change. This is enabled by 
engagement with the workforce and 
other stakeholders, including the UK 
Government and NGOs. We also 
collaborate with other businesses and 
agencies, for example our partners in the 
Zero Carbon Humber Partnership. There 
are more details about such engagement 
on pages 40 to 45. The Executive 
Committee also develops and considers 
policies and procedures that provide an 
effective framework for operating in line 
with required standards, laws and 
regulations, for example our Code of 
Conduct which was launched following 
Board approval in October 2020 and our 
policy on Diversity and Inclusion 
launched in September 2020.
The Executive Committee meets 
informally on a weekly basis in addition  
to 11 monthly meetings each calendar 
year. In addition, the Executive 
Committee attended several meetings  
of the Board between April and June  
in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The Executive Committee considers 
business performance against the annual 
plan and progress in realising longer-term 
objectives. Reports are provided on each 
of the business units covering financial 
and non-financial metrics. The latter 
include, for example, matters affecting 
the safety and wellbeing of our workforce 
which is the opening agenda item for 
each meeting. Ethics and values are also 
a standing agenda item. During 2020,  
as the impact of Covid-19 deepened, the 
regular in-depth evaluation of financial 
performance included detailed 
assessment of cashflow and associated 
assets and liabilities. More on the 
financial review is covered in the report 
of the Audit Committee on page 98. 
In 2020, the Executive Committee 
reviewed in depth all nine principal  
risks, as identified on pages 66 to 77.  
It considered stakeholder engagement, 
with a focus on the political landscape 
that could impact Drax’s ability to 
execute its strategy. A summary of the 
Committee’s activities can be found in 
the table below. 
Where relevant to the matters under 
discussion, papers are distributed ahead 
of meetings to brief Committee members 
on matters to be discussed. Members 
also received presentations on various 
business issues by senior managers 
within the business units. Biographies  
of the Executive Committee members 
can be found on the website drax.com/
about-us/corporate-governance/

88 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
The Covid-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented and 
rapidly evolving crisis requiring effective, agile and timely 
decision-making by the Board and management.
Deploying online video conferencing, the Board responded  
to the initial phase of the pandemic by holding a series of 
additional Board meetings throughout April, May and June. 
The purpose was to oversee management’s response and  
to understand the impact on employees and customers. 
Members of the Executive Committee attended these 
meetings, together with other key members of senior 
management as necessary. Each meeting commenced  
with a report on the safety and wellbeing of employees.  
This included implementing office closures, arrangements 
for working from home where possible, the impact on the 
mental wellbeing of employees, and adapting working 
practices. In particular, the Company wanted to protect key 
workers at the power stations and processing plants, and to 
develop clear safety principles for those required to work on 
our sites. The Board also oversaw the operational response 
to continuing to deliver the Group’s key objectives during  
the pandemic. You can read more about this on page 81.
The meetings also discussed management’s assessment  
of the potential financial and operational impact of the 
pandemic on the Group’s business, and expectations on  
the ability to execute the Group’s key objectives. The Board 
received regular updates on the Group’s liquidity position, 
trading figures and cash flow. Given the timing of the early 
phase of the pandemic, and its proximity to April’s Annual 
General Meeting, the Board considered carefully (in 
conjunction with advisers) its capacity to pay the final 
dividend and the appropriateness of doing so. The Board 
took due regard for the Group’s projected cash generation,  
in addition to external considerations including the views  
of the UK Government and shareholders, and the experience 
of all stakeholders in their relationship with Drax.
The Board also considered feedback from the workforce 
MyVoice forums, particularly in relation to the Group’s 
response to Covid-19. The Board considered communication 
plans, as well as engagement with key stakeholders such  
as the Government, Ofgem and the National Grid. There were 
also updates on the rapid IT-led response to support home 
working, distribute equipment and change systems to ensure 
the stability and security of remote operations. The Board 
discussed and agreed a series of support measures for 
affected communities and stakeholders. You can read  
more about this on pages 34 and 35.
Corporate Governance Report continued
Role of the Board
The Board determines: the Group’s purpose, strategy and 
business model for long-term value creation; appetite for  
risk and risk management policies; annual plan and budget,  
to ensure that the Group has the necessary resources to  
deliver the strategy; key performance indicators to measure 
performance against strategic objectives; stakeholder 
engagement, including shareholder engagement and 
engagement with the workforce; acquisitions, disposals, and 
other transactions outside delegated limits; material changes to 
accounting policies or practices; significant financial decisions; 
capital structure and dividend policy; the effectiveness of the 
Group’s governance structure, including business conduct, 
ethics and whistleblowing; prosecution, defence or settlement 
of material litigation; Directors’ Remuneration Policy; the terms 
of reference of Board committees; and the Board structure, 
composition and succession.
Terms of reference
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decisions 
and formal terms of reference for its Committees. These are 
reviewed periodically and the terms of reference of the 
committees of the Board are available to view on the Group’s 
website at www.drax.com.
Matters not specifically reserved to the Board and its 
Committees under their terms of reference, or for shareholders 
in General Meeting, are delegated to the Executive Committee 
or otherwise delegated in accordance with a schedule of 
delegated authorities approved by the Board. These were 
reviewed by the Board and updates approved in December 2020. 
How the Board functions
Routinely, prior to the formal meeting of the Board, the Chair 
and the Non-Executive Directors meet in private without 
management being present. This allows the Chair and Non-
Executive Directors to exchange views and share any concerns 
before the meeting starts. At each Board meeting, the CEO gives 
a report on key business, operational and safety matters and 
reports on the Group’s financial performance. The Board also 
receives regular reports on performance against the business 
plan, operational and financial performance, periodic business 
reports from senior management across the Group, and updates 
on investor relations and wider stakeholder engagement.
During 2020, there was a focus on understanding the 
operational and financial impact arising from Covid-19. This 
included, for example, the ability of smaller customers within 
our Customers business unit to make payments and take 
alternative appropriate measures. These measures included the 
ability to defer payment deadlines, to forgive certain overdue 
payments, or to apply discounts to help support customers 
experiencing severe financial hardship. Brexit remained a 
regular and key agenda item during the year, with updates from 
management on the planning for 1 January 2021, consideration 
of the potential risks and appropriate mitigations and the 
post-transition phase. You can read more about this in Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties on pages 66 to 77. 
The Board receives regular industry, regulatory and topical 
updates from internal specialists and from external experts  
and advisers. In June, for example, Francis Sullivan, Board Chair 
of the Sustainable Biomass Program, attended a call with the 
Board where biomass sustainability and key stakeholders were 
discussed. During the meeting, the Board also discussed the 
means by which Drax could engage with those supportive to,

and those against the use and expansion of biomass as  
a renewable fuel source. 
The core activities of the Board and its Committees are 
documented and planned on a forward agenda. A list of matters 
arising from each meeting is maintained and followed up at 
subsequent meetings. The Group Company Secretary advises 
the Board on governance matters, ensuring good information 
flows within the Board, its committees, the Executive 
Committee and senior management. The Group Company 
Secretary is responsible for ensuring the Board complies with  
all relevant processes and for assessing compliance with the 
Listing, Prospectus, Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules, the Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act. 
An important part of this is effective collaboration with other 
parties across all Group functions. Good training, regular 
discussions on key issues, and support from those in areas  
of critical operational risk in evaluating areas for change are 
also imperative.
All Board Committees are authorised to obtain legal or other 
professional advice as necessary to perform their duties.  
This includes securing the attendance of external advisers  
at meetings and seeking required information from any member 
of the Group’s workforce.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) give the 
Directors power to authorise conflicts of interest when they  
are presented with such matters for their review. The Board has  
an effective procedure to identify potential conflicts of interest, 
consider them for authorisation and record them. In 2020, no 
conflicts of interest were identified. The Articles also allow the 
Board to exercise voting rights in Group companies without 
restriction (for example, to appoint a director to a Group 
company). The Articles were reviewed by the Board in 2020 to 
make sure they reflect best practice and evolving regulation. 
For example, the revised Articles include provisions to enable 
the use of technology to support the conduct of general 
meetings, with shareholders attending remotely. A resolution 
seeking approval for the new Articles reflecting the changes 
(more details of which are set forth in the notice of meeting) will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting being held in April 
2021. The current Articles are available on the Group’s website 
at www.drax.com.
Culture
The Board routinely monitors and assesses the Group’s culture, 
including a MyVoice annual workforce engagement survey. 
Health and safety, as a standing Board agenda item, is one  
of the first subjects under consideration at every meeting.  
The discussion includes absolute measures such as injury rates, 
as well as the prevailing safety culture and safety processes 
around the business. The CEO provides regular updates to the 
Board regarding workforce engagement and feedback from the 
meetings between the Chair, CEO and the chairs of the MyVoice 
forums. You can read more about engagement with the 
MyVoice forums on page 92.
The Group Ethics and Business Conduct Committee (EBCC),  
a sub-committee of the Executive Committee, meets quarterly 
and monitors and supports initiatives to enhance and assess 
ethical behaviour and business conduct across Drax. The EBCC 
supports the Group’s commitment to doing the right thing in  
its business practices by making sure there are appropriate 
communications to raise awareness. This sub-committee also 
ensures the provision of training that informs behaviours in 
accordance with our values and ethical principles (as set out  
in the “Doing the right thing” handbook). In 2020, this handbook 
was replaced by the Drax Code of Conduct, which covers ethics 
and broader topics including health, safety and the 
environment. This was approved by the Board, published on the 
Drax website and intranet, and deployed across Drax in October 
2020 as a mandatory read for the whole workforce. It also forms 
part of the Drax induction for new starters, including relevant 
non-permanent workers.
As part of the Drax commitment to influencing positive  
change in its operations, the Board approved a Supplier Code  
of Conduct at its meeting in October 2020. This forms part of 
Drax’s processes to onboard new suppliers, who Drax expects 
to act in accordance with its code. Suppliers are also expected 
to work together with Drax to the benefit of the communities  
in which they operate.
The EBCC conducts an annual review and risk assessment  
of each compliance programme, covering anti-bribery and 
corruption (including conflicts of interest), fair competition, 
financial crime, privacy, Speak Up (whistleblowing), and supply 
chain human rights. The Business Ethics team reports regularly 
to the Audit Committee on investigations and key matters, and 
annually on EBCC activities for the year. Members of the EBCC 
include an Executive Director (the CFO, who is Chair of the 
EBCC) and two Executive Committee members (the Director  
of Corporate Affairs and the UK Portfolio Generation Director). 
This supports an understanding of business culture and 
attitudes, and informs Board and Executive Committee 
discussions. The subject of ethics and values is a standing 
agenda item for the Executive Committee, with the CFO 
responsible for raising such matters as Chair of the EBCC.
A new Speak Up (whistleblowing) policy was approved by  
the Board in February 2020 and published across the Group  
in March 2020. The Group Company Secretary is the 
Whistleblowing Officer. A compliance programme dedicated to 
Speak Up was introduced during the year and, for the first time, 
a Speak Up risk assessment and risk register were presented  
to the EBCC for review. The Business Ethics team supports 
oversight of the external, anonymous and confidential, Speak 
Up service available within Drax. This has been extended to 
third parties, such as suppliers and visitors to our sites, and is 
available in multiple languages and promoted in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct. The team also responds to any reports from 
within Drax, as well as those referred to the Company via the 
external service. Specific guidance was published in July 2020 
for all employees and for managers, (since they may receive  
a Speak Up report). In addition, the topic of Speak Up and a 
commitment to non-retaliation against reporters was included 
in the new management excellence training module for 
managers. Speak Up is prominently featured in both the new 
Drax Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, the latter 
encouraging Drax suppliers to have their own Speak Up service. 
Regular updates on Speak Up reports and cases are provided  
to the Executive Committee and the Board.
The Board receives regular updates on whistleblowing, and  
a quarterly report on business ethics is presented to the Audit 
Committee on “entity controls” which includes Speak Up 
(whistleblowing) matters. An annual report of EBCC activities  
is made to the Audit Committee, including Speak Up reports and 
investigations. Four whistleblowing related matters remained 
under investigation at the date of this report.

Corporate Governance Report continued
Drax seeks to ensure that employees and relevant “associated 
persons”, such as certain types of contractors, receive 
appropriate communications and training on key matters 
underpinning ethical behaviours. These include Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption (including Conflicts of Interest), Fair Competition, 
Financial Crime, Privacy, Supply Chain Human Rights and Speak 
Up (whistleblowing). Drax also regularly reviews its suite of 
policies to ensure continuous improvement. There’s more

Board leadership of stakeholder engagement
We have a well-established programme of engaging with a wide 
range of stakeholders who are key to the successful delivery  
of our strategy. These include shareholders, government, 
regulators, environmental bodies and trade unions. We know 
that actions taken today will shape the longer-term 
performance of Drax and determine our impact on the wider 
world, including our contribution to action on climate change. 
Such engagement broadens our understanding of the issues  
we take into account, informs our decision-making and helps  
to protect the long-term interests of stakeholders.
The Board is responsible for engagement with stakeholders  
and ensures that appropriate Board time is given to discussing 
stakeholders and sufficient resources are available for the 
Group to effectively engage. The Corporate Affairs team 
maintains a detailed map of our key stakeholders and the 
concerns they have raised and the date of meetings with them. 
Members of executive management, including Executive 
Directors, provide regular updates to the Board, to ensure 
awareness and inform discussions. The Board takes these 
opportunities to assess and challenge management’s approach 
relating to engagement. During the spring and early summer of 
2020, the Board held regular calls with executive management. 
The Board heard reports on the engagement strategy with the 
UK Government, shareholders, customers, local community and 
employees with due regard for the Covid-19 pandemic. These 
discussions explored the appropriate approach to engagement, 
with guidance from external advisers (including remuneration 
advisers, Corporate Brokers, and sustainability experts) on 
various aspects of the Group’s operations and decision-making. 
These informed the Board’s approval of initiatives including 
enabling our employees to work safely in the right working 
environment, whether on-site at the plants or remotely from 
home. The Board also approved the provision of support to Care 
Homes and laptops to children.
On 27 February 2020 Drax announced that it had proposed 
to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station 
effective in March 2021 – ahead of the UK’s 2025 deadline 
– with formal closure of the coal units in September 2022. 
The Board concluded that this decision was vital to support 
the Company’s long-term strategy to be carbon negative by 
2030. Throughout the decision-making process, the Board 
considered and kept in mind the likely impact on various 
stakeholders.
From the latter half of 2019, management had undertaken 
detailed planning of scenarios on the future of coal-based 
generation. In particular, these plans considered a scenario 
where Capacity Market contracts were not secured in the 
Auction in early 2020. Throughout the assessment phases, 
the Board and management were kept informed on the 
evaluation, including the possible impact of alternative 
scenarios on the environment and various stakeholders. 
These included employees, trade unions, and the local 
community. This evaluation also considered what levels of 
financial and non-financial support would be required for 
those affected. Non-financial support, for example, includes 
on-site career transition services from independent experts, 
and retraining packages to enable development of new skills 
and alternative placements within other functions.
Discussions also evaluated the positive impact of ceasing 
coal-based generation early, in particular on the environment 
and reduced carbon emissions. The Board agreed that 
stopping the use of coal supported the Group’s purpose –  
to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future. The Board 
also felt it was the right long-term decision for the business, 
our communities and the environment. In addition, this is  
an important step on the Group’s journey to become carbon 
negative by 2030. The long-term economics of coal 
generation remained challenging and in 2019 coal generation 
represented only 3% of the Group’s electricity production.
The Board also discussed engagement with Government, 
local politicians and National Grid in the period following  
the Auction. In January 2020, Drax did not take a Capacity 
Market agreement for the period beyond September 2022 
given the low clearing price. Management presented further 
analysis to the Board in February 2020, recommending at 
that stage to proceed with a closure of commercial coal 
generation, which the Board approved.
Following the decision and announcement, consultation  
on all key areas was undertaken with trade unions and 
employee representatives. Feedback from this process  
was considered, allowing the Board to assess the process 
undertaken to date and consider further measures to  
be implemented, for example resulting in changes and 
enhancements to the financial and retraining packages. 
The Board recognises that the engagement scores for the 
Generation business were on average below the scores for 
the Group as a whole in 2020. This is a business area that  
has been through considerable change in 2020, therefore,  
management, colleagues and discussions forums, including 
the MyVoice forums, are working on actions plans to improve 
engagement scores in 2021.

Number of meetings held
The Board and its Committees have regular scheduled meetings 
and hold additional meetings as required. The Board has eight 
scheduled meetings each year, with the Board meeting at least 
annually to specifically consider strategy. Directors are 
expected, where possible, to attend all Board meetings, relevant 
Committee meetings, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and 
any other General Meetings.
Board roles
The key responsibilities of members of the Board are as follows:
Position
Role
Chair
Responsible for leading and managing the 
Board, its effectiveness, and governance. 
Makes sure Board members are aware of, 
and understand, the views and objectives 
of major shareholders and other key 
stakeholders. Helps to set the tone from 
the top in terms of the purpose, goal, vision 
and values for the whole organisation.
CEO
Responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the business, developing 
the Group’s strategic direction for 
consideration and approval by the Board 
and implementing the agreed strategy.
CFO
Supports the CEO in developing and 
implementing strategy, in relation to the 
financial and operational performance  
of the Group.
Senior Independent 
Non-Executive 
Director
Acts as a sounding board for the Chair 
and a trusted intermediary for other 
Directors. Available to discuss any 
concerns with shareholders that cannot 
be resolved through the normal channels 
of communication with the Chair or the 
Executive Directors.
Independent 
Non-Executive 
Directors
Responsible for bringing sound 
judgement and objectivity to the Board’s 
deliberations and decision-making process. 
Constructively challenge and support the 
Executive Directors. Monitor the delivery 
of the strategy within the risk and control 
framework set by the Board.
Time commitment
Directors’ commitments outside of Drax are kept under review 
to make sure they have sufficient time to dedicate to the 
business and effectively perform their role. Under the terms  
of the Chair’s letter of appointment, the Chair is expected to 
commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to this role. Under 
the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment, each is 
expected to commit 12 to 15 full days a year. That includes 
attendance at Board meetings, the AGM, one annual Board 
strategy off-site event and at least one site visit each year 
(although this was not possible in 2020 due to Covid-19).
In addition, Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote 
appropriate preparation time ahead of each meeting. The  
time commitment expected in respect of their membership  
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees is an 
additional three to four full days a year in each case. However,  
in practice, considerably more time is devoted, particularly by 
the Chairs of the Committees.
The CEO’s report to the Board regularly includes a section 
detailing activity around key stakeholder relations and the 
relevant feedback received from stakeholder interactions. During 
2020, this extended to outlining key initiatives in ESG matters in 
response to expectations of NGOs as well as current and 
potential investors. In June 2020, the Board received a detailed 
update on stakeholder engagement including the critical issues 
being addressed by the Group and the proposed strategy for 
engagement with stakeholders.
Supporting the Board’s duty to promote the success of the 
Company as set out in Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, 
Board discussions, and supporting papers, for material decisions 
consider the likely impact on those stakeholders affected by the 
decision. You can find our Section 172 Statement on page 40. 
The article on page 90 provides an example of this in action  
in respect of the decision in 2020 to close the coal units. For 
more detailed information on our stakeholders and how we 
engage with them please refer to our “Stakeholder” section  
on pages 40 to 45.
Directors’ development and induction
To assist the Board in undertaking its responsibilities, a 
programme of training and development is available to all 
Directors, with training needs assessed as part of the Board 
evaluation procedure. The Board programme includes regular 
presentations from management and informal meetings to 
build understanding of the business and sector, or in areas 
recognised as being technically complex. Such training is 
intended to support a deeper understanding as well as 
equipping the Non-Executive Directors with insight into how 
Drax’s approach compares with the practices of its peers. 
During the year, external consultants FMCR led one-to-one 
training with each director on Corporate Treasury. Directors 
considered the day-to-day activities of the Drax treasury 
function, the governance associated with decision-making  
and reporting, and the evaluation of the management of  
key risks together with the associated mitigation.
Directors also had access to the advice and services of the 
Group Company Secretary throughout 2020. Directors may  
take independent advice at the Company’s expense, when it  
is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. No such independent advice was sought in 2020.
All new Directors receive a comprehensive and tailored 
induction programme, including meetings with key managers, 
site visits, and briefings on key operational matters, Board 
procedures and governance matters.

The MyVoice Forums were established in 2019 to facilitate 
effective and direct engagement between the Board and  
the workforce. The Company has four divisional employee 
forums, comprising elected representatives from across  
the business. A member of the senior leadership team and  
an HR representative support these divisional forums and 
attend each meeting. The chairs of these forums then  
meet quarterly with the Chair and CEO.
During 2020, engagement with the MyVoice forum chairs has 
been invaluable in helping the Board gain ongoing feedback 
in a period of rapid and significant change to the way we live 
and work. The engagement has helped to support the 
business in managing the transition to remote working and 
ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our workforce.
The forums provided feedback from employees on the 
Company’s response to the first phase of the pandemic.  
The rapid response and the Company’s commitment and 
support was welcomed, and the fact that no colleagues had 
been furloughed was acknowledged. The forums particularly 
recognised and highlighted the challenge to the wellbeing  
of colleagues. In response, the Group provided mental health 
awareness training for managers, online workshops to help 
build resilience, an ongoing wellbeing campaign to help 
colleagues stay safe and well both physically and mentally 
during lockdown, and engagement activities to help keep 
employees connected.
In the second half of the year, forum discussions turned  
to recovery plans and future ways of working. The forums 
collated employee feedback that helped to inform our 
flexible working policies, launched in November, giving 
employees greater choice in how they want to work in the 
future. Following the Board’s strategy week at the end of 
October, the Chair and CEO provided the forum chairs with  
a summary of the strategy discussions. They also provided 
updates on the Q3 performance and the latest situation 
regarding Covid-19.
The annual engagement survey was conducted in October 
and the chairs were given early visibility of the results for  
the Group and their business areas. The chairs then gathered 
feedback on areas highlighted for more action, to help 
understand what was driving the results. The Group HR 
Director then attended a meeting of the chairs to discuss 
feedback and decide what actions should be taken. At the 
final meeting of the year, the chairs discussed what worked 
well during 2020 and the future areas of focus for 
improvement. This was followed by a further two separate 
workshops with the chairs to discuss plans to evolve the 
forums in 2021. 
Nicola Hodson, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, joined 
a quarterly meeting in June 2020 to introduce herself and 
present on the role of the Committee. She explained how 
engagement with shareholders helped to set the 2020 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors and senior 
management. She also outlined the Committee’s work in 
reviewing policies for the wider workforce, to make sure 
executive remuneration aligned with wider Company pay 
policy and Company culture. The meeting also included a 
question and answer session with the chairs. Following this 
meeting, Nicola recorded a video to introduce herself to the 
entire workforce, discussing pay and conditions around the 
Group, her role and background, and her passions such as 
diversity and inclusion. This was accompanied by a letter to 
the whole workforce setting out in more detail the role of the 
Committee and how pay aligns across the Group. Following 
positive feedback to Nicola’s engagement, the Board 
committed to engage more in this manner and, in December 
2020, John Baxter recorded a video for all employees, 
introducing himself, describing his long career in engineering 
and discussing one of our key priorities; health and safety.
The Chair and CEO provide updates to the Board following 
each meeting with the MyVoice chairs to make sure that all 
directors understand the views of employees. Nicola Hodson 
also provided feedback to the Board following her discussion 
on remuneration with the MyVoice forum chairs.
Corporate Governance Report continued
Executive Directors may, with the prior approval of the Chair, 
take on one additional role in an external listed company. None 
of the Executive Directors have taken on such a role. Non-
Executive Directors may, with the prior approval of the Board, 
take on additional roles provided the individual can continue  
to devote sufficient time to meet the expectations of their role.
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to undertake visits  
to Drax operations, and spend time with management and  
the workforce. This is designed to build and then maintain  
their knowledge of the developing business and to understand 
the operational challenges. It was not possible for the Non-
Executive Directors to make site visits in 2020, due to Covid-19. 
However, the additional Board meetings from April to June 
allowed considerable time for listening to management and 
understanding operational challenges. These meetings also 
enabled the Board to assess the effectiveness of actions being 
taken and to scrutinise both the financial and non-financial 
impacts of the pandemic.
Board composition and independence
The Board has reviewed the independence of each Non-
Executive Director. None of the Non-Executive Directors  
who served during the year had any material business or other 
relationship with the Group, and there were no other matters 
that were likely to affect their independence of character  
and judgement. The Board recognises that in view of the 
characteristics of independence set out in the Code, length  
of service is an important factor when considering the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors and that directors 
who have served more than nine years may not be considered 
independent.
The Board considers all the Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent.

Summary of the Board’s activities in 2020
Over four days in October 2020, the Board conducted a detailed review of strategy, using online video conferencing. 
Management delivered a series of presentations to the Board and Executive Committee and there were discussions on 
progress made during the year in delivering on strategic imperatives. The review also considered investment opportunities  
and objectives over a five- to ten-year horizon. This included investment in the current business and emerging technologies, 
emerging and projected trends, the developing environmental landscape and Drax’s contribution to addressing climate change.

How does the Nomination 
Committee support the 
Group’s purpose?
Having the right mix of skills, experience and 
diversity on the Board and throughout the 
business is key to achieving our purpose
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
• Keep under review the Board’s structure, size and composition 
(including requisite skills, diversity, knowledge and experience)
• Ensure there is a succession planning process for the directors 
and other senior managers, including the identification of 
candidates from both within and outside Drax that align  
with the objectives of the business and Group
• Conduct the search and selection process for new directors, 
taking advice from independent search consultants as 
appropriate
• Monitor and challenge initiatives and progress in addressing 
diversity and inclusion
• Report on Board evaluation
Nomination Committee activities since the last report
• Considered re-appointment of the Chair for a third term
• Considered the re-appointments of two Non-Executive Directors
• Reviewed the skills of the Board
Introduction
I’m pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2020.
As Chair of the Nomination Committee, I make sure that there  
is a formal process for regularly reviewing the balance of skills, 
experience and diversity at Board and senior management 
levels. This process also ensures the people in those roles are 
capable of understanding, challenging and enabling the 
strategic imperatives of Drax, both in the near and medium 
term. The Nomination Committee continues to focus on the 
need for Drax to reflect a diversity of backgrounds and 
perspectives. The Board is committed to playing a role in 
shaping that activity and ensuring diversity and inclusion are a 
fundamental part in recruitment, retention, career progression 
and personal development. We recognise that such activity 
contributes to the culture and values of the Group as well as  
to its long-term success.
The Committee considers management’s actions in attracting 
new talent and developing the careers of people, enabling them 
to realise their potential. A key aspect of this involves executive 
management supporting employees in balancing their work 
Terms of reference
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed 
annually by the Committee and then by the Board, most 
recently in January 2021. The terms of reference are 
available on the Group’s website at  
www.drax.com/governance

responsibilities, maintaining a quality of life outside of Drax,  
and embracing and embodying our values. During meetings 
held in 2020, we have regularly discussed the ways in which  
our leaders are encouraged to consider and communicate  
these aspects. We have also considered the effectiveness of 
such work, based upon feedback I have heard at the quarterly 
MyVoice Forum meetings, the results of our annual employee 
engagement survey, and the CEO’s reports.
Succession planning and diversity
Each year the Committee reviews the Group’s succession plan, 
identifying those employees with the potential to progress into 
more senior roles across a timeframe of one to five years. The 
review focuses on factors including technical skills, experience, 
behaviours and attitudes. This is to ensure the business has the 
right leaders in place to deliver our strategy collaboratively and 
transparently and in ways that support our purpose and culture.
Drax has undergone a series of changes in recent years, 
including the appointment of three new non-executive 
directors since 2018 and one new executive director. Over  
the same period six senior executives have joined the Group’s 
Executive Committee. In April 2020, Andy Koss stood down as 
an executive director by reason of redundancy. Out of a total  
of seven board members at 31 December 2020, two are female. 
Two of the Executive Committee’s eight members are female.
The Board and senior management recognise that Drax needs 
to do more, at all levels of the business, to support people from 
diverse backgrounds. In September 2020, the Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy was updated and, following approval by the 
Board, launched across the Group. The review included aspects 
of new and emerging best practice and regulatory 
developments, including in the area of senior management  
and Board diversity. The policy goes beyond gender, with a clear 
commitment to a supportive, diverse and inclusive working 
environment, where you can be yourself and your contribution 
matters. The policy now covers all protected characteristics  
as well as educational and professional background, all of  
which are important for social diversity activities. 
During 2021 we intend to implement our revised Diversity and 
Inclusion plan that supports our commitment to an inclusive 
culture for all. This multi-faceted plan will include renewing  
our approach to data, educating and inspiring our colleagues  
on diversity and inclusion and ensuring we pay attention to 
attracting the broadest talent available to Drax. It is supported 
by a Group wide Code of Conduct, new Flexible Working 
Policies, and revised Family Friendly Policies. We have invested 
in additional resource to lead this plan and our new Diversity 
and Inclusion Manager joined in January to lead and drive the 
plan across the organisation. 
Our recruitment processes support both our succession 
planning and our diversity and inclusion activities. We operate 
programmes that encourage a diverse workforce to pursue 
careers and qualifications that fit with the opportunities that 
Drax offers. These include apprenticeship schemes, training 
programmes, and experience days where young people can 
learn more about what we do and the roles available. All of 
these activities are an important part of our role in the industry. 
This engagement is two-way as we listen to people from diverse 
backgrounds to better understand what barriers exist and what 
support would be required to encourage them to join a business 
such as Drax. In October 2020, we announced a £180,000 
five-year partnership with Selby College in Yorkshire that will 
enable the college to deliver community education programmes 
and support for retraining. This will ensure students are 
developing the skills needed in the innovative clean 
technologies that will help to drive a zero carbon economy.  
You can find out more about our programmes on page 56.
The Executive Committee participated in an externally-led 
workshop looking at how we need to change to enable diversity. 
As mentioned above, the reports of the CEO to the Board now 
include regular updates on the work being done to support 
diversity and inclusion. You can find out more about this on 
page 60.
Our succession planning is mindful of the evolution of the 
Group. We must be prepared to look outside the Company, as we 
believe that will contribute a fresh perspective to delivering the 
Group’s objectives. As explained in other sections of this report, 
the safety and wellbeing of the workforce is a matter of priority 
that is discussed at all Board meetings. The Board recognises 
the importance of ensuring we have the right skills and 
capabilities to enable a proactive approach to health and safety. 
This is particularly true as we continue to grow and implement 
new methods of working to improve business performance. In 
2019, the Board appointed John Baxter as a Non-Executive 
Director and he brings extensive experience of engineering, 
safety and workplace governance. During 2020, as part of 
regular Board meetings, members of the Committee were kept 
informed on the search and selection process for a new Group 
Health & Safety Director. This resulted in the appointment of 
Dr Vanessa Forbes, who has over 20 years’ experience. This 
includes health, safety and environmental matters in corporate, 
regulatory and consulting roles across complex and hazardous 
multi-site operations. Following her induction and 
familiarisation with the Group, Vanessa attended a Board 
meeting in September where she presented her initial views  
and thoughts on opportunities for change.
Non-Executive Directors: terms of appointment
Under the Board’s policy, Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial term of three years. The term can be 
renewed by mutual agreement if the Board is satisfied with  
the director’s performance and commitment and a resolution  
to re-elect at the appropriate AGM is successful. The Board  
will not normally extend the aggregate period of service of any 
independent Non-Executive Director beyond nine years and  
will rigorously review any proposal to extend a Non-Executive 
Director’s aggregate period of office beyond six years.
In 2020, the Board considered the re-appointments of both 
David Nussbaum, Senior Independent Director, and Nicola 
Hodson, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, each for a 
second term of three years. The Board considered their skills 
and contribution, together with the feedback from the most 
recent externally supported evaluations of the Board and our 
Committees. Following this, the Board approved extensions of 
their appointments for a further three years, respectively taking 
effect from 1 August 2020 and 12 January 2021.
Board and Committee evaluation
Recognising it needs to regularly monitor performance, the 
Board conducts an annual performance evaluation, fully 
inducts new Board members, and ensures ongoing Board 
development activities. Board Alchemy conducted an 
externally-led evaluation of the Board’s performance in the 
autumn of 2019 and reported the findings to the Board in 
November 2019. The table on page 97 summarises the 
recommendations and how we responded to them in 2020. The 
Board considered possible responses to the recommendations 
96 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Nomination Committee report continued
at a meeting in September, with detailed discussion on the 
initiatives to address recommendations and areas for potential 
further improvement.
As the Chairs of the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee were relatively new in post in 2019, the Board  
was the primary focus that year. However, it was agreed that  
a formal, externally-led, review of the Committees should be 
performed in 2020. Board Alchemy also led that review in the 
autumn, and the Board considered the results at a meeting  
in December. In conducting the Committee evaluations,  
Board Alchemy interviewed all members of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees in autumn 2020. Ahead of this, each 
of the Directors completed a detailed questionnaire on how 
they viewed the role of the Committee and how it functions. As 
part of the evaluations, Board Alchemy also met with the Group 
Company Secretary and key internal stakeholders who attend 
and/or support the Committees. Board Alchemy has no other 
connection with the Group or individual Directors.
The evaluation concluded that the Committees were well led by 
effective, inclusive chairs and the Committee members had the 
requisite skills and experience to provide valuable contributions 
and effective challenge. The review confirmed that effective 
planning routines now in place supported the Committees in 
ensuring sufficient time to consider matters in advance of 
decisions being required. 
It was noted that “teach-in” sessions provided for the Audit 
Committee by Drax management and external specialists on 
key topics, such as treasury and hedging, helped to ensure 
members of the Committee were up to speed on technical 
areas. Further, the review noted there is good dialogue and 
constructive relationships between the Audit Committee Chair, 
CFO and the external audit partner. The Remuneration 
Committee was mindful of the impact of decisions and 
recommendations on a wide range of stakeholders, and there 
had been effective communication with the workforce by the 
Remuneration Committee Chair who engaged with colleagues 
to explain the Group’s remuneration practices. 
Skills and knowledge of the Board
A key responsibility of the Committee is to ensure the Board 
maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
appropriate to the long-term operation of the business and 
delivery of the strategy. As in previous years, the Nomination 
Committee has reviewed the Board’s composition and 
considered whether the:
• Board contains the right mix of skills, experience and diversity
• Board has an appropriate balance of Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors
• Non-Executive Directors are able to commit sufficient time  
to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively
Following the review, the Committee was satisfied that the 
Board continued to have an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience, now and for the future, to operate effectively. All the 
Directors have many years of experience, gained from a broad 
range of businesses. Collectively. they bring a range of expertise 
and sector knowledge to Board deliberations, which encourages 
constructive, challenging and insightful discussions.
Renewal and re-election
Any newly appointed Director is required to submit themselves 
for election at the first AGM following their appointment.
Drax has adopted the provisions of the Code, providing for all 
Directors to seek re-election annually. Accordingly, John Baxter, 
Philip Cox, Will Gardiner, Nicola Hodson, David Nussbaum, Andy 
Skelton and Vanessa Simms will all retire at the forthcoming 
AGM and being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election.  
The evaluation and review of the Board and its Committees, 
described above, concluded that the Directors offering 
themselves for re-election continue to demonstrate 
commitment, management and business expertise in their 
particular role and continue to perform effectively. Further 
information of the service contracts for the Executive Directors 
and letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors are 
set out in a table on page 129. The Executive Directors’ service 
contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment 
are available for inspection (by prior arrangement) during 
normal business hours at the Company’s registered office.  
They will also be available for inspection at the venue of the 
AGM, prior to that meeting, details of which are contained  
in the Notice of Meeting.
Report of Senior Independent Director
In 2020, Philip Cox indicated his willingness to serve for a 
third, and final, term of three years. It is the Group’s policy  
to rigorously review any proposal to extend a Non-Executive 
Director’s aggregate period of office beyond six years. As 
such, and as Senior Independent Director, I led a review in  
the summer of 2020 into Philip’s re-appointment as Chair.
I spoke individually with each of the Non-Executive and 
Executive Directors to seek their views on Philip’s 
performance and key strengths. A variety of options were 
considered and discussed in the course of these reflections 
At the September Committee meeting, which Philip did not 
attend, the Non-Executive Directors discussed feedback 
from that engagement. Committee members considered a 
number of different aspects of Philip’s leadership, the 
evolution of Drax, and the likely skills required looking 
forward. The factors under discussion included: the 
management of significant changes in Board composition 
over the last three years; feedback from the 2019 Board 
evaluation that concluded Philip showed good leadership, 
invested the necessary time, cultivated good dynamics and 
an open and transparent Board culture, and ensured there 
was appropriate Board focus on the long term; the views of 
the two executive directors; the opportunity to change the 
skills and diversity of Board membership; the relationship 
between the Chair and the CEO; and the effectiveness of  
the Board under Philip’s leadership. 
Following these discussions, the Committee unanimously 
recommended to the Board that Philip be re-appointed for  
a further, and final, term of three years when his second term 
expired at the end of 2020. Looking ahead, the Committee 
also proposed that the recruitment process for a successor 
as Chair should start early enough to allow for a thorough 
recruitment process. This would also facilitate an overlap 
period when the Chair-designate could join the Board with 
sufficient time to complete a meaningful onboarding process.

Our targets for 2020
What we did
Supporting non-executive 
Board members by
(i)  improving the quality 
of Board papers,
(ii)  making presentations 
at Board meetings  
more effective, and
(iii)  regularising the 
programme of Board 
development (teach-ins) 
and bringing a greater 
external perspective 
to these sessions
The Board held several “teach-in” sessions in 2020, 
including a presentation on biomass acceptability 
and one-to-one training supported by external 
consultant FMCR on Treasury and FX. The Board 
also saw broker presentations on Drax activities 
(for example considerations around the full-year 
and half-year dividends, including the views of  
key stakeholders).
The chair of Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) 
attended a Board meeting to discuss governance, 
biomass sustainability, and the views of third 
parties including NGO’s.
To achieve greater focus on the quality and 
timeliness of Board papers, a template has been 
adopted. Contributors have been given support to 
ensure greater clarity in identifying the key issues 
for consideration, both in the papers and live 
discussions. Most papers are now reviewed by the 
Executive Committee before submission to the 
Board, to make sure the content reflects the 
business issues/matters for debate and includes 
– where applicable to the subject matter – an 
assessment of key stakeholders.
Members of the Executive Committee attended 
Board meetings and supported discussions on  
a range of key decisions. The evaluation of the 
closure of the Group’s coal units, when wider 
management also attended and presented to  
the Board, is just one example.
Give greater focus to 
executive succession 
planning while continuing  
to periodically review Board 
composition and non-
executive succession
A detailed review in the early part of 2020, focused 
on the structure of the Generation business. 
A further detailed review will be undertaken in  
early 2021 to consider both Board and executive 
succession – something planned originally for 
autumn 2020. However, due to several strategic 
projects being undertaken in the second half of 
2020, this was deferred until there was greater 
clarity on the future shape of the business.
Work on Diversity across the wider organisation  
has been the subject of a detailed review by 
management. Through the CEO reports, the Board 
has been appraised of the work being undertaken 
by the executive, including an Executive 
Committee workshop supported by a Diversity  
and Inclusion facilitator.
Continuing to increase the 
focus on understanding 
stakeholder perspectives 
and giving consideration  
to what the Board’s role 
should be in stakeholder 
engagement
The Board received regular updates on stakeholder 
views and perspectives. For example, as part of 
assessing the possible early closure of the Group’s 
coal units, the Board received management’s 
analysis of the key stakeholders within and outside 
the Group. The Board considered the impact of  
the decision on the local community and the steps 
being taken to support those employees who 
would be affected. This included, for example, 
employee assistance programmes for those 
affected by the changes being made to working 
practices and workforce numbers. Updates were 
also received on engagement with unions and 
employee representatives through the course of 
the year. For more information on this work, please 
see page 90. The Board also regularly discussed 
the evolving views of stakeholders on sustainability 
(for example, see the first item in this table) and the 
views and wellbeing of employees in response to 
the Covid-19 pandemic.
In June, the Board considered a report presented 
by the External Affairs Director and Group Director 
of Corporate Affairs. This explained engagement 
with stakeholders in the first half of the year and 
plans for the second half including, for example, 
with business partners, regional leaders and 
representatives in the north east of England in 
connection with Drax’s BECCS programme.
Continue work on values  
and behaviour and consider 
how the Board should get 
assurance that the culture  
it is looking for is in place
Through a combination of the CEO’s regular reports 
to the Board, as well as the MyVoice Forums (which 
have been attended by the CEO, Chair and in  
June the Chair of the Remuneration Committee), 
the Board has received feedback on key topics 
impacting the organisation, its culture, values  
and delivery against its purpose.
The CEO relayed to the Board the positive response 
received from employees and the leadership team 
on how the Group’s purpose, values and culture 
have been shared and enacted. This included 
sharing the autumn 2020 Employee Engagement 
survey results – which were above the benchmark 
– and agreeing actions with the Board. It also 
included sharing the work on bringing the values  
to life across the organisation.
The Board received and considered – with help 
from members of the Executive Committee – 
regular updates on safety and employee wellbeing. 
It also reviewed how the business has adjusted 
working practices in response to Covid-19. KPIs, 
process safety and wider safety initiatives are also 
reported to the Board at each meeting.
A detailed programme reviewing and updating the 
Group’s suite of policies is in progress, to underpin 
the Group’s culture and values. In September, for 
example, the Board approved the revised Code of 
Conduct and, in October, a separate Supplier Code. 
The latter sets out expectations of the standards 
for Drax’s suppliers.
During the year, I met regularly with the Non-Executive 
Directors in the absence of the Executive Directors. Separately, 
the Senior Independent Director held a meeting with the 
Non-Executive Directors without me being present, as required 
by Provision 12 of the Code.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Nomination 
Committee.

What are the key areas  
of focus for the Audit 
Committee?
We are focused on ensuring fair 
and balanced performance reporting is  
in place, underpinned by a robust system  
of internal control
Letter from the Chair of the Committee
2020 has seen significant challenges for our people, customers, 
partners, communities and businesses in general. Circumstances 
such as those experienced due to Covid-19 are impactful across 
all aspects of our society and in such times we rely on a 
combination of resolve, initiative and strong engagement, 
underpinned by the values by which we live and work and the 
standards we set for the way in which we conduct ourselves. 
From the earliest phase of Covid-19, the Audit Committee 
contributed to the work of the wider Board and management  
in assessing how Drax was placed to respond to the pandemic. 
As part of that we also sought to understand business 
effectiveness at sustaining day-to-day operations and effective 
internal controls, as our people went through material changes 
in adapting to both new working patterns and evolving external 
issues. Regular Board calls took place from April 2020 which 
considered the approach being taken to enable our employees 
to adapt to home working and the provision of equipment and 
secure online access by which to perform their roles. This 
included assessing the resilience of our systems in enabling 
access, recording and storage of business-critical information 
as part of maintaining sound internal controls. 
As well as assessing business resilience, the Committee 
challenged management’s assessment of the potential financial 
impact to the Group. This included understanding the financial 
performance of each business unit, and the factors most  
likely to affect the expected results, judged against both 
management’s expectations and those of external stakeholders. 
During the initial phase of the pandemic, management provided 
thorough analysis to the Board and Audit Committee of the 
expected demands on the Group’s distributable reserves and 
cash resources ahead of the trading update published in April. 
As part of this review, the Non-Executive Directors challenged 
management in their evaluation of whether or not the Group 
would need to seek support under measures introduced by  
the UK Government, including furloughing. This supported an 
assessment that the Group was in a strong position to maintain 
its regular operations, meet the projected demands on its 
financial resources, and to continue to employ and pay all  
of our people and meet our obligations to third parties. We  
also assessed the appropriateness of paying the final dividend 
in May and received feedback on the views of shareholders,

UK Government and advisers, which resulted in a decision  
to maintain the original recommendation to shareholders  
of paying the 2019 final dividend of 9.5p per share. A similar 
approach was taken in reaching a conclusion in respect  
of the 2020 interim dividend, and the overall appropriateness  
of maintaining the Group’s capital distribution policy. 
A trading update was issued at the AGM, held on 22 April 2020, 
outlining the anticipated impact of Covid-19 on the Group’s 
financial prospects for 2020. This was reiterated at the time  
of issuing our Half Year results to 30 June 2020 (Half Year) and 
has remained consistent in the reporting of our financial results 
for the full year.
Elsewhere in this report, see page 40, we explain actions taken 
to support stakeholders and communities. The measures 
adopted responded to engagement by our External Affairs team 
and took into account the views and ideas expressed by our 
employees. We also considered initiatives with our customers 
that could relieve the pressure of meeting payments as part of 
proposals submitted by our Customers business’ management 
team. These initiatives required appropriate analysis of the 
capacity of the Group in setting and fulfilling commitments, 
which was supported by initial challenge and consideration  
by the Audit Committee and Board.
Such engagement and understanding of the business 
performance, and the capacity of the Group to carry through  
its strategic imperatives whilst also responding effectively to 
emerging challenges will continue to be required through 2021. 
This recognises that the pandemic will continue to impact 
society as a whole in the year ahead. In tandem with the specific 
measures I have outlined, the Audit Committee has continued to 
assess actions associated with effective management, reporting 
and internal controls in fulfilling the Group’s priorities through 
2020 and into 2021 as well as safeguarding good governance.
On page 25 we explain the refinancing of elements of the 
Group’s debt during 2020. The Audit Committee supported  
the Board in considering the proposed structure of the new 
facilities, the terms and capacity of the Group to service such 
arrangements through the longer term. It is encouraging to 
note that a growing proportion of the facilities extend beyond 
2027, and that as part of the terms Drax continues to 
incorporate provisions linked to the delivery of our ESG 
commitments. Such provisions were considered by the Audit 
Committee. in supporting the adoption of the new facilities. 
Whilst Covid-19 has been, and we expect will continue to be, an 
important area of the work of management and the Committee, 
the business, financial performance and delivery of our strategy 
remained key areas of focus for us during 2020.
Drax’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions is a 
fundamental part of our purpose. In February 2020, the Board 
announced the decision to end commercial coal generation in 
March 2021, with formal closure of the coal units in September 
2022. In the period leading up to the decision, the Audit 
Committee discussed in detail the analysis of the proposed 
closure on the Group’s financial model, and the timing of any 
decision in respect of the Group’s reporting obligations, with  
due regard for the importance of the Capacity Market Auction 
outcome which was announced on 31 January 2020, following 
the Group’s financial year end in December 2019. In conjunction 
with the decision to proceed with the closure, the Committee 
considered and challenged the initial assessment of the 
financial impact and reviewed the form of disclosure released 
to markets and included in the annual report for 2019 as a post 
balance sheet event. In assessing the financial impact, particular 
attention was given to the anticipated closure costs and the 
useful lives and potential impairment of relevant assets at Drax 
Power Station which were disclosed in the Half Year results.
During 2020, the Audit Committee remained attentive to the 
schedule of matters for which it has delegated responsibility,  
in addition to other issues which arose during the course of  
the year. The effectiveness of our internal controls is one such 
aspect of the Committee’s delegated remit and during 2020  
we continued to receive regular reports on areas which were 
evaluated by our Internal Audit team. This included assessment 
of the transition to a single payroll function across the UK 
Group, reviews of cyber security controls and IT controls, and  
a review of the findings in respect of the Group’s biomass 
sustainability, required in respect of the Contract for Difference 
and Renewables Obligation schemes. A number of these reports 
were supported by external specialists, bringing particular 
knowledge and an external perspective to the reviews and 
findings submitted to the Committee. 
As with all such reports, our Internal Audit team also track 
actions taken in addressing recommendations and the outcome 
of those actions are also considered in subsequent meetings  
by the Committee, which forms an important part of both 
continuous improvement and addressing potential weaknesses. 
During 2020, in conjunction with the retirement of the Head  
of Group Risk and Internal Audit, the Committee determined  
to separate out these two functions. The change provided  
the opportunity to review how the activities were managed,  
and to bring in additional and broader expertise and specialist 
capabilities to support the Group. Following a review, it was 
agreed to appoint KPMG as internal auditor. KPMG have in 
previous years supported discreet elements of our internal  
audit work and they commenced their new role following  
the Half Year. 
The appointment of KPMG to lead internal audit ensures that 
internal controls reflect not only the evolution of the Group but 
also bring to bear the advancement in standards and industry 
practices in which leading external consultants are a key 
contributor. A Head of Risk is in position, who shadowed the 
in-depth assessment of principal risks undertaken at the Half 
Year. This included assessing the impact of Covid-19, which we 
recognised merited proportionate disclosure in the Half Year 
results in keeping with the guidelines issued by the FRC. The 
findings from the detailed review undertaken through the 
second half of the year in support of the principal risk 
disclosures can be found on pages 66 to 67.
In addition to the change introduced in the outsourcing of the 
internal audit function, the Committee supported management 
in evaluating changes to oversight of health, safety and 
environmental. On page 95 we explain the appointment of 
Vanessa Forbes as new Group Health, Safety and Environment 
Director. The Committee also supported the appointment of 
external HSE specialists to augment the Group’s internal 
capabilities. This resulted in the appointment in November 2020 
of DNV GL Limited, a company forming part of a global business 
with extensive experience in HSE matters.
Overall, the Committee has been pleased with the progress 
made through the course of 2020 and the responsiveness  
to requested actions and initiatives arising from the internal 
audits, despite the challenge of working remotely.

Audit Committee report continued
Such work is an important part of assurance but also of building 
strength across the range of financial and non-financial 
operations which underpin the Group. It also helps to reinforce 
the values and culture which inform how as individuals, teams 
and a Group we perform our work. 
In October 2020, the Chair of the Board received a letter from 
the FRC regarding our 2019 annual report, in connection with  
a thematic review of climate disclosures. I worked with the Chair 
of the Board, management, and also Deloitte as our external 
auditors in considering the matters raised, and the responses 
and areas in which we considered improvements could be 
made. As with all stakeholders, the feedback we have received 
from the FRC helps to inform how we act, including how we 
provide information to wider stakeholders that enables them  
to understand our business and performance.
In the rest of this report we outline the other activities of  
the Committee and the teams which support its areas of 
responsibility. Continued focus on such matters is important if 
we are to maintain the required standards expected of us and 
support the growth and delivery of business opportunities for 
the Group as we implement our strategy for the longer term.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling  
its oversight responsibilities which includes undertaking  
the following:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and other 
information provided to shareholders
• reviewing significant financial reporting issues and judgements 
contained in the financial statements
• advising the Board on whether the Committee believes the 
Annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable
• maintaining an appropriate relationship with the Group’s 
external auditor and reviewing the effectiveness and objectivity 
of the external audit process
• maintaining and monitoring the non-audit services policy
• reviewing the systems of internal control and risk management
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function
• making recommendations to the Board (to put to shareholders 
for approval) regarding the appointment of the external auditor
The Chair of the Committee reports on the Committee’s 
activities and considerations at each Board meeting following 
the Committee’s meeting. The minutes of each Committee 
meeting are circulated to all members of the Board.
In undertaking its duties, each member of the Committee has 
access to the services of the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Group Company Secretary and their resources, as well as 
access to external professional advice. In addition, the Chair 
holds meetings with the Chief Financial Officer out of cycle 
from the formal meetings and also attends planning meetings 
with those preparing for forthcoming meetings of the 
Committee in order to discuss relevant papers and key matters.

The Committee allows time at each meeting to speak in the 
absence of management with each of the external auditor and 
the internal auditor. The Committee’s understanding with both 
the external and internal auditor is that, if they should at any 
time become aware of any matters giving them material 
concern, they should promptly draw it to the Committee’s 
attention via the Chair of the Committee. No such issues  
were raised in 2020.
Committee Activities in 2020
The Committee follows a programme of work designed to 
ensure that sound risk management processes, a robust system 
of internal control and fair and balanced performance reporting 
are in place.
The Committee undertakes its duties reflecting an annual work 
plan, which is agreed each November for the following calendar 
year. In addition, where appropriate to activities in the Group or 
to reflect changes in applicable regulations, additional agenda 
items are incorporated to ensure members of the Committee 
have the opportunity to consider and contribute to an analysis 
of material issues. The main areas of work undertaken by the 
Committee during 2020 at its routinely scheduled meetings  
are set out in the table above.
Explanations of the critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions are set out in detail throughout the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, with a summary on page 
152. The Committee reviewed these aspects of the financial 
statements, paying particular attention to those issues that 
involved the most subjective and complex judgements, namely 
impairment of fixed assets, valuation of derivative financial 
instruments, valuation of bad debt provisions and accuracy  
of unbilled revenue, which are discussed on page 102.
In October 2020, the Group received a letter from the FRC’s 
Corporate Reporting Review team, requesting information 
about certain matters arising from their review of the Group’s 
2019 Annual report and accounts as part of its thematic review 
of climate disclosures. As a result of the correspondence, the 
Group has sought to enhance clarity in certain disclosures, 
particularly in relation to impairment, in the 2020 Annual report 
and accounts. The Committee reviewed and approved the 
Group’s responses to the FRC’s enquiries at its meeting in 
December 2020.
The review conducted by the FRC was based solely on the 
Group’s published report and accounts and does not provide 
any assurance that the report and accounts are correct in all 
material respects.

Reviewing the effectiveness of the system of risk management 
and internal controls
The Committee received updates on the Group’s internal 
control environment and reviewed internal audit reports at 
each of the four meetings held during 2020. Particular focus 
was given to how the business was strengthening the IT and 
Security control frameworks in response to Covid-19, which saw 
the majority of employees transition to working remotely over  
a short timeframe. This included acquiring, configuring and 
deploying laptops and associated hardware, facilities for 
meetings, provision for employees to operate ‘call centre 
capability’ in support of the Customers business, changes to 
security controls in response to wider working from home, and 
promoting awareness amongst employees of the heightened 
threats from fake websites, phishing attacks and fraud.
In addition, the Committee received updates on the financial 
risks and financial controls covering each of the Group’s 
business units. The various updates, reviews and reports 
allowed both control and audit issues to be discussed with 
management. Risk mitigations and progress with previously 
agreed actions were also monitored and progress discussed.  
At its December meeting, the Committee also received an 
update on a project to review, document and implement a single 
Group-wide financial control framework, bringing together 
good practice from across the Group’s businesses to form  
a single, consistent policy and minimum set of standards, 
applicable across the entire Group. 
No material issues have arisen with the operation of controls  
in individual business units during 2020.
The Committee reviewed the categories used to report to 
shareholders and other stakeholders the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties explained in the report (see pages 66 to 77).  
The review included discussion of retaining a disclosure 
associated with ongoing uncertainty from Brexit and Covid-19. 
The explanation of the principal risks also reflects the review  
by the Committee and separate evaluations by the Executive 
Committee, supported by a presentation by the Head of  
Group Risk. 
The Committee also reviews information arising from 
Whistleblowing reports as appropriate to the circumstances and 
matters under review. The Committee considers the scope of 
investigation and the appropriateness of the steps being taken. 
The Board is also updated on these reviews. An explanation of 
the Group’s Whistleblowing policy can be found on page 63.
Reviewing key accounting estimates and judgements
The significant issues in relation to the financial statements were as follows:
Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Valuation of derivative 
financial instruments
The Group makes extensive use of derivative 
financial instruments to manage key risks facing 
the business. The balance sheet includes 
significant assets and liabilities arising from 
derivatives which are stated at their fair value.  
In particular the fair values of forward foreign 
currency purchase contracts reduced 
substantially in the financial period following the 
strengthening of sterling against the US dollar.
The fair values for derivative financial instruments 
are determined using forward price curves and, 
where an instrument incorporates an element of 
optionality, an option pricing model.
The inputs to these calculations include 
assumptions regarding future transactions  
and market movements, as well as credit risk,  
and are therefore subjective. The nature of the 
calculations is inherently complex and given  
the size of the portfolio small variations in 
assumptions can have a material effect upon  
the overall fair value.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s derivative 
position in February, July and December 2020, 
having regard in particular to the judgemental 
areas described in note 7.2 to the financial 
statements. The Committee considered the 
position as at 31 December 2020 at its meetings 
on 15 and 22 February 2021.
At each meeting, management provided updates 
on movements in market prices that underpin 
changes in the fair value of the derivative 
portfolio and highlighted the treatment applied  
to any new types of derivative instrument for  
the Committee’s consideration.
The Committee has concluded that the fair value 
calculations had been performed in a reasonable 
and consistent manner, that the disclosure in the 
financial statements was appropriate and that 
the key controls underlying the calculations were 
fit for purpose.

Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Impairment of fixed assets
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where 
appropriate, groups of assets in CGUs) for 
potential impairment. Impairment reviews are 
conducted on an ongoing basis and are triggered 
by either the existence of potential indicators of 
impairment or, in the case of goodwill and other 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, 
conducted at least annually.
The Customers and Pellet Production businesses 
generate independent cash flows to be 
equivalent to the operating entities within those 
businesses resulting in three CGU’s for Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. The 
Generation business considers its assets that 
generate independent cash flows to be the eight 
individual sites that share common infrastructure 
and control functions. The Group’s four OCGT 
development assets were treated as a single CGU 
for impairment purposes. 
If an indication of potential impairment exists, 
goodwill is allocated to the CGU, or the CGU 
contains an intangible asset with an indefinite 
useful life. the recoverable amount of the asset  
or CGU is assessed with reference to the present 
value of the future cash flows expected to be 
derived from its value in use or its expected  
fair value.
Assumptions that underpin the assessment of 
value in use for each CGU are based on the most 
recent approved business plan, and include all of 
the necessary costs expected to be incurred to 
generate the cash inflows from the CGUs assets 
in their current state and condition.
Impairment reviews rely on assumptions and 
management key judgements regarding future 
market prices, cashflow forecasts, discount rates 
and the use of appropriate sensitivities.
At its meeting in July 2020, the Committee 
reviewed analysis prepared by management that 
determined Drax Power Station should be treated 
as two CGUs following the announcement to 
close commercial coal generation in March 2021. 
At the same time, the Committee reviewed the 
forecasts and analysis supporting the conclusion 
that the recoverable amount of the coal CGU was 
zero, and the associated fixed assets should be 
written off in full. The Committee challenged 
management’s analysis and in particular 
considered the difficulties associated with 
ensuring completeness of the impairment charge, 
noting the history of the site as a single combined 
generator.
Also in July 2020, the Committee reviewed a 
paper from management that updated the overall 
2019 impairment analysis for the half year and 
concluded that, despite an impact from Covid-19 
on headroom for the Customers CGUs, no 
impairment was required.
In December, the Committee reviewed 
management’s proposed approach to conducting 
impairment reviews for the 2020 year end. The 
results of that analysis were reviewed at the 
Committee’s meetings in February 2021. The 
Committee paid particular attention to the 
reviews in respect of:
• The Opus Energy CGU, considering the significant 
impact of Covid-19 on the CGU in the period and 
challenging management’s scenario analysis 
taking into account plans for future operations
• The OCGT projects, reflecting the status of the 
development projects and risk associated with 
future plans and execution.
Having considered management’s reports, and 
challenged the approach and key assumptions 
made, the Committee concluded that the 
approach to impairment reviews was appropriate 
and no further impairment charges were 
necessary over and above those booked in 
respect of specific coal asset obsolescence. 
Finally, the Committee reviewed the impairment 
disclosures in the annual report and concluded 
that the key judgements and sensitivities had 
been appropriately disclosed, and the matters 
considered as part of the response to the FRC’s 
letter received during the period had been 
appropriately addressed.

Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Accuracy of unbilled 
Customers revenue and bad 
debt provisions
Revenue from electricity and gas supplied to 
customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the financial year end is based on 
estimates in relation to the volume of energy 
consumed and the valuation of that consumption.
The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the Group’s 
expectation of payment delays and business 
failure, particularly in the SME segment. This is 
reflected in an increased income statement 
charge in respect of expected credit losses and 
an increase in related provisions held on the 
balance sheet at 31 December 2020.
The Committee reviewed with management  
the process for and assumptions applied in 
determining the calculation of unbilled receivables, 
noting that historically, financial settlements had 
been closely in line with the amounts accrued in the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Committee also reviewed the approach for 
calculating the expected credit losses associated 
with Customers sales, as described in more detail in 
note 3.6 to the financial statements. Particular focus 
was given to the development of the probability 
model (described in note 3.6) and  
the ability of the model to reflect updated 
assumptions as the Group’s experience of cash 
collections and settlements changed following the 
advent of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Committee 
considered and challenged management’s 
representations around the  
need for additional incremental provision over and 
above that indicated by the model, to reflect the 
current systemic uncertainty in the economic 
environment. 
The Committee reviewed with management  
the key assumptions applied in determining  
the calculation of unbilled receivables noting  
the reliance of third party data for estimates and 
actual usage volumes from meter readings and the 
external auditors testing assurance that confirmed 
the models work appropriately.
The Committee concluded that the calculation  
of expected credit losses going forward using  
the probability methodology was appropriate and 
resulted in a final provision that was supportable and 
appropriate prudent in the current economic 
circumstances. The Committee was also satisfied 
that disclosure in the financial statements detailing 
the approach had been made appropriately.
Areas of particular focus – insights on the Committee’s work
Throughout the year, the Committee has provided oversight to 
management’s execution of key strategic projects, considering 
the key judgements made and the impact of such projects on 
the financial statements.
At its meeting held in February 2020, the Committee received  
a report from management covering the Board’s potential 
decision to close coal generation at Drax Power Station. In 
particular, the Committee challenged management on the key 
judgement related to the timing of changes in the assessment 
of cash-generating units at Drax Power Station, which 
ultimately led to the impairment of associated assets being 
recognised. On 31 January 2021, the Group concluded the sale 
of its portfolio of CCGT assets to VPI Generation Limited. At its 
meeting in December 2020, the Committee satisfied itself that 
the proposed presentation of the transaction in the financial 
statements was appropriate. The actual presentation was 
subject to a final review and was approved as part of the 
February 2021 meetings. As part of this approval, the Committee 
noted that the key judgement (the timing of the assessment of 
the CCGT portfolio as a discontinued operation and held for 
sale), and the main source of estimation uncertainty (being the 
fair valuation of the £29 million contingent consideration) were 
not material, but concluded that the approach adopted on both 
items was appropriate.
During the year, the Group issued new euro-denominated senior 
secured notes and entered new Infrastructure term loan 
facilities. The proceeds from these new facilities were drawn  
in November 2020 and used, along with cash reserves, to 
redeem the existing sterling 2022 bond and ESG loan facility. 
The Committee reviewed the approach taken to accounting for 
the new facilities and the redemption of the existing facilities  
by management. Particular focus was given to the treatment of 
refinancing costs as exceptional items in the income statement. 
In addition, reflecting the increased proportion of the Group’s 
debt denominated in foreign currencies, the Committee 
reviewed and approved a proposal from management to include 
an additional presentation of net debt in the 2020 Annual 
Report, that incorporates the effect of derivative financial 
instruments used to fix the sterling value of debt repayments  
at maturity. As part of its review, the Committee noted that the 
proposed new measure would likely be useful to users of the 
accounts by removing FX volatility from the calculation, better

Reviewing the 2020 Annual Report & Accounts
At its meeting held in December 2020, the Committee received 
reports from management on its planning for the various 
elements of the 2020 annual report, including a timetable for 
preparation of drafts and the contributions being made by 
members of the wider management and executive teams in 
drafting, peer review and commenting on the sections. That 
meeting also discussed how such review would support 
ensuring the annual report was fair, balanced and 
understandable. 
Between the year-end date and the date of the approval of the 
Annual report and accounts, the Committee met on 15 February 
2021 to understand progress with the audit and discuss a paper 
covering key accounting estimates and judgements, as well as 
reviewing the key year-end work completed around principal 
risks. The meeting was attended by management and Deloitte. 
The Committee met again on 22 February 2021 principally to 
review the draft 2020 Annual report and accounts and the 
external auditor’s findings. The Committee reviewed papers 
prepared by management on key areas of disclosure and 
explanation within the accounts, and also a report from  
Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte“) setting out their audit findings.
Also reviewed were internal controls, forecasts and relevant 
assumptions made in preparing the Viability Statement and 
considering the appropriateness of adopting the going  
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Having 
challenged the assumptions around availability of finance  
and covenant compliance made in the process and considered 
the appropriateness of the three-year period of assessment,  
the Committee concluded that the Viability Statement 
disclosed on page 64 was robust and that the Statement  
was fair and balanced. 
The Committee considered and reviewed management’s 
disclosure on exceptional items and the adjustments which 
were taken through the middle column on the presentation  
of the three-column income statement, (which can be found  
on page 154 referring where necessary to the agreed 
accounting policy). 
Fair, balanced and understandable
As a result of its review of the Annual report and accounts, 
underpinned by its discussions with operating and finance 
management regarding the strategic report, and with the  
Group finance team regarding the financial statements, the 
Committee advised the Board that, in the Committee’s view,  
the Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s and 
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Review of Committee effectiveness
In line with the FRC’s Guidance on Committees, the Committee 
periodically reviews its own effectiveness. During the autumn 
of 2020, an externally facilitated review of the performance  
of the Committee was undertaken. The outcome of the review 
found that the Audit Committee works well, with an effective 
Chair and committee members all providing valuable 
contributions and effective challenge. The review also found 
effective planning routines are in place, ensuring there is 
sufficient time to consider matters in advance of decisions 
being required, and the challenges of surprises or disruption 
can be mitigated. It was noted that ‘teach-in’ sessions provided 
by Drax management and external specialists on key topics, 
such as treasury and hedging, helped to ensure members of  
the Committee were up to speed on technical areas. Further, 
the review noted there is good dialogue and constructive 
relationships between the Audit Committee Chair, CFO and  
the external audit partner.
External Audit
Effectiveness of external audit
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor in April 2020 and does so annually. Deloitte LLP 
(Deloitte), who have performed the role of external auditor 
continuously since the Company’s listing in 2005, were 
reappointed in 2017 following a competitive tender process. 
Anthony Matthews acts as Audit Partner and has significant 
listed company auditing experience working within the energy 
and resource sector and had previously led the Group’s 
Customer business unit audit. 
The Committee’s review primarily considered the independence 
and objectivity of Deloitte, their professional competence,  
past performance and the robustness of the audit process.  
The full assessment in 2020 by the Committee considered 
feedback from members of the Finance and wider management 
team. Views were sought on such matters as the quality of work 
and engagement in the course of planning and undertaking 
their audits and reviews at both Group and business unit level. 
The Committee also assessed the oversight of the financial 
reporting process, in particular the Committee’s own 
discussions with the auditors of the audit work performed  
on areas of higher audit risk and the basis for the auditor’s 
conclusions on those areas, as well as the depth of the  
auditor’s understanding of the Company’s business. 
As also reported in the 2019 Annual report and accounts,  
in January 2020, the FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) team 
submitted its final report and findings to the Group regarding 
Deloitte’s audit of the Group’s 2018 financial statements.
At its February 2020 meeting the Committee considered  
in detail the findings of the FRC’s review. In advance of this 
meeting the Chair and Audit Partner discussed the findings and 
the Chair met with the Acting Director of the FRC responsible 
for the AQR report. 
The Committee noted three areas recommended for 
improvement in relation to the work performed on testing the 
rebasing of certain financial instruments, the documentation  
of the acceptable range applying to the valuation of power 
contracts and the estimation of unbilled revenue in one of the 
business units. A fourth area related to the work completed on 
the purchase price valuation, which was appropriately disclosed 
as provisional in 2018 and finalised in the 2019 financial 
statements. At the meeting, the Audit Partner explained how 
Deloitte had responded to the AQR’s findings and the measures 
taken to address relevant matters. The Committee noted 
Deloitte’s confirmation of improvements to the work completed 
in the 2019 audit in these areas. The Committee also requested 
Deloitte ensure the responses to the FRC’s findings are 
evidenced in all future audits when relevant. The Committee 
noted that no adjustments to the financial statements were 
required as a result of this review.

Audit Committee report continued
Having considered the results of the review, the actions taken, 
and improvements made by Deloitte to address the areas 
identified, the Committee concluded that there were no matters 
which cast doubt on the fundamental quality of the audit.
Based on its overall review of effectiveness of the external  
audit and auditor discussions, feedback from management, 
interactions and satisfactory consideration and response to  
the FRC’s AQR, the Committee concluded it was satisfied that 
the external auditor and audit was effective and agreed that 
their work demonstrated an ongoing commitment to audit 
quality. The Committee was satisfied the audit process was 
robust and Deloitte had shown strong levels of technical 
knowledge and provided appropriate professional scepticism.
Independence of external audit
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy (“AIP”) which 
defines procedures and guidance under which the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditor will be governed, and forms 
part of the means by which the Committee is able to satisfy 
itself that there are no factors which may, or may be seen to, 
impinge upon the independence, objectivity and effectiveness 
of the audit process. The AIP was reviewed by the Committee  
in July 2020. Within its most recent review the Committee 
considered areas of development in practice and guidance in 
the factors which the Committee should consider in evaluating 
the key tenets of independence, objectivity and effectiveness. 
The main features of the AIP are:
• review the quality and cost effectiveness of the audit and  
the independence and objectivity of the external auditor
• a requirement to rotate the lead audit partner every five years, 
and processes governing the employment of former external 
auditor employees
• a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit work, under which the general principle will be that 
no non-audit services are undertaken by the incumbent audit 
firm, unless the work to be allocated requires a certificate or 
other assurance of the Company’s appointed auditor, the 
services provided relate to interim review and the reporting 
accountant activity or exceptional circumstances warrant it, 
and only then where the Committee is satisfied the 
engagement of the audit firm is justified on merits which are 
clearly articulated by management and agreed in advance by 
the Committee.
Anthony Matthews will rotate off the audit in 2021, at the end  
of a five-year period of involvement. During 2020, the 
Committee reviewed the CVs of potential replacement partners 
from Deloitte and approved the appointment of Makhan Chahal 
from 2021. The decision was based upon the depth of Makhan’s 
sector experience, relevant FTSE 100 and 250 signing partner 
experience and experience with complex trading and hedging 
positions.
The balance between the fees paid to the external auditor  
for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee.
The AIP is available on the Company’s website: www.drax.com.
The Committee also receives reports from the external  
auditor on its own processes and procedures, to ensure its 
independence and objectivity and to ensure compliance  
with the relevant standards.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the 
year for audit and other services are set out below and in note 
2.3 to the consolidated financial statements on page 164.

Certain non-audit services were performed by Deloitte during 
the year. The external auditors should not provide non-audit 
services where it might impair their independence or objectivity 
to do so. To ensure this principle is followed, the engagement for 
the provision of any non-audit services requires prior approval 
from the Committee Chair or Committee. Agreement to allow 
the audit firm to perform additional services is taken after 
considering that the non-audit services policy has been fully 
applied and that any engagements were in the best interests  
of the Group and its key stakeholders. 
During the year there was an increase in the level of non-audit 
services provided by Deloitte which in total amounted to 
£326,000, of which £98,000 covered the Group’s Interim 
review. The Committee was satisfied that the overall levels  
of audit and non-audit fees were not of a material level relative 
to the income of Deloitte as a whole. 
The Committee were also satisfied that the level of non-audit 
fees was below the 70% cap based on the average audit fee  
for the preceding three years.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, Deloitte are providing 
ongoing support in a limited reporting accountant role in 
respect of the shareholder circular for the proposed acquisition 
of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. This work was reviewed  
and approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with  
the policies outlined above, with due consideration given  
to independence and in the context of the fee cap for  
non-audit services.

Auditor Reappointment
The Group has fully complied with the provisions of The 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
The Committee recommended to the Board that a resolution  
to reappoint Deloitte as the Company’s external auditor should 
be put to shareholders at the AGM in April 2021 following 
discussions at its meeting held on 22 February 2021.
Internal Audit
The Group historically operated a co-sourced model for its 
internal audit function. Under this model, the internal team 
conducted core financial and operational controls reviews. 
Reviews of specialist technical areas, including controls  
over regulatory compliance, were outsourced to firms with 
appropriate experience and qualifications, primarily KPMG, 
following consultation with the Committee.
During 2020 the Committee assessed the best approach to 
sustaining high quality internal audit and risk management 
functions. As part of a detailed review, the Chair of the 
Committee and the CFO assessed potential partners for a fully 
outsourced internal audit model, subsequently meeting with 
the preferred partner. At its meeting in April the Committee 
considered the options available and determined that the 
internal audit and risk management functions be separated, 
moving to a fully outsourced internal audit model. The 
Committee noted that the outsourced partner would allow the 
Group to draw on particular skills, prevailing market knowledge 
and wider industry-relevant experience, such as in IT and 
security, trading and commodities. KPMG was selected as the 
new internal auditor, to be supported by an internal team, which 
would also provide the opportunity to extend their capabilities 
and knowledge.
Fees will be agreed on an audit by audit basis depending on 
scope. A detailed plan to manage the handover and the 
engagement with key internal stakeholders from finance,  
risk, existing internal audit team members, management and 
the Committee was approved and subsequently executed.
The Committee reviews and approves the internal audit plan  
for the year. Its review is designed to ensure that priority is given 
to the areas of highest risk for the Group and that the audit 
work focuses on key controls, to optimise the level of assurance 
provided to the Committee and to management. The Committee 
receives reports at each meeting regarding the internal audit 
programme and reviews undertaken.
Recommendations are made to management for control 
improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit 
reports reviewed by the Committee during 2020 included IT and 
Cyber controls, procurement and payroll.
In addition, at each of its scheduled meetings, the Committee 
received reports detailing progress with implementing 
recommendations previously raised by internal audit to allow 
them to effectively monitor management’s responses. The Chair 
of the Committee, independent of management, maintains 
direct contact with both the internal and external auditor, 
allowing open dialogue and feedback.
The Committee recognises the importance of maintaining and 
evolving effective policies and procedures for the day-to-day 
operational activities of the Group. This spans such matters  
as engineering practices, maintenance, process safety and 
training which are integral to ensuring our employees are 
suitably enabled with the requisite knowledge and equipment 
to perform their work effectively and safely. The Committee 
reviewed and supported the appointment of a new external 
consultant, DNV GL Limited, tasked with the internal audit of 
the Group’s health, safety and environmental practices. The 
Committee also determined that KPMG should, as part of  
their 2021 programme, undertake reviews of the policies and 
procedures pertaining to operational and engineering activities. 
This is intended to augment ongoing work which is being 
undertaken by management to update Group-wide policies  
and procedures.
The Committee has considered the overall effectiveness  
of internal audit, based on the quality of its plan and the 
information provided in its reporting, and is satisfied that the 
revised model described above remains appropriate for the 
Group on the basis of quality, experience and expertise. In 
reaching this conclusion, the Committee considered the views 
of management and the external auditors, as well as its own 
assessment of the quality of reports and support provided  
by the internal audit function.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee 
on 24 February 2021.

This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008, as amended (the Regulations) and the provisions of 
the Code.
How has Drax ensured that 
executive remuneration 
outcomes have been both  
fair and appropriate?
Despite 2020 being a challenging year, 
management has delivered solid business 
results and progressed the Group’s strategy, 
and the remuneration outcomes for the 
Executive Directors and senior management 
appropriately reflect this
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The principal responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee 
(the Committee) are to:
• keep under review the implementation of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.
• determine the remuneration strategy and framework for the 
Executive Directors and senior management, ensuring that 
executive remuneration is aligned to the Group’s purpose, values 
and strategy.
• determine, within that framework, the individual remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors and senior management.
• approve the design of annual and long-term incentive 
arrangements for Executive Directors and senior management, 
including agreeing targets and payments under such 
arrangements.
• determine and agree the general terms and conditions of 
service and the specific terms for any individual within the remit 
of the Committee, either on recruitment or on termination.
• determine the policy for, and scope of, executive pension 
arrangements.
• oversee any major changes in employee remuneration 
throughout the Group, ensuring there is a consistency with  
the culture and values of Drax.
Key Remuneration Committee activities in 2020
• completed a full review of the Remuneration Policy (the Policy), 
including a comparison of the Policy against the requirements 
of the Corporate Governance Code, and finalised engagement 
with shareholders.

remuneration matters on protecting and supporting employees 
through Covid-19.
• reviewed and contributed to the full review of reward 
arrangements for all employees across the Group below Board 
and senior management.
• considered and approved the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and senior management.
• reviewed the salary increases and aggregate bonuses paid  
in all businesses and corporate functions.
• considered and approved the Committee’s Annual Report

Annual Statement to Shareholders
Dear shareholders,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee).  
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for the 2020 financial year. In April 2020, our shareholders 
approved the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy) with 
94.61% of votes in favour. They also approved the Annual Report 
on Remuneration for 2019, with 98.82% of votes in favour.  
The Committee and I are grateful to our shareholders for their 
continued support.
The report is set out in the following sections:

123 – 133
Our aim at Drax is to ensure transparency with our shareholders 
and wider stakeholders in the development and implementation 
of remuneration and associated governance. The vote in April 
2020 for the new Policy followed extensive consultation with 
our major institutional shareholders. This helped to inform 
important decisions on the design of the Policy, including for 
example, pension arrangements where from 1 January 2023  
the contribution rates for existing Executive Directors will be 
aligned with the rate for new joiners to the wider workforce. 
We explain the full Policy on pages 112 to 122 and provide details 
of the Committee’s decisions in respect of implementing the 
new Policy during the 2020 financial year.
As noted throughout the annual report, 2020 was a very 
challenging year but it has also been a year of achievements  
that should make us proud. The Group has delivered a strong 
performance in 2020 and management has worked hard to  
keep colleagues safe and well informed during significant 
change to working practices. Together we have continued  
to deliver essential services to the country.
As I mentioned on pages 30 and 31, the Committee has given 
very careful consideration to the impact of Covid-19 on 
remuneration outcomes, and our discussions have been 
applicable to Executive Directors, senior management, as well 
as to all other colleagues. The principal focus of the Committee 
has been to ensure outcomes are fair and appropriate with 
respect to business performance, and consistent across the 
wider workforce.
Review of decisions made during 2020
Annual assessment of performance
The Committee determines the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee against  
the strategic objectives and priorities of the Group. For 2020, 
we achieved this through assessing performance against a 
combination of strategic business and financial metrics. The 
Group Scorecard reflects these metrics, and you can see details 
on page 124.
A high proportion of total remuneration is delivered through 
variable pay, rewarding the achievement of a balance of Group 
short-term and long-term targets. For the 2020 plan, there 
continued to be no personal performance element in the 
determination of bonuses for Executive Directors and members 
of the Executive Committee.
As described by Will Gardiner on pages 10 to 14, the Group  
has delivered solid financial performance in 2020 and has 
continued to progress key strategic objectives. The 2020 Group 
Scorecard included metrics reflecting key objectives for all 
major business areas, including Pellet Production, Generation 
and Customers. While the performance in the Pellet Production 
and Generation businesses remained very strong in 2020,  
the Customers business was more significantly impacted by 
Covid-19 and this was reflected in the financial performance of 
this business area. The detailed review of achievement against 
the performance metrics in the 2020 Group Scorecard is on 
pages 124 and 125.
The Committee determined that the overall performance 
outcome against the Group Scorecard represents a fair 
reflection of the Group’s performance during the financial year 
and did not exercise any discretion in its determination for 
bonus outturn. The outcome of the Group Scorecard was 0.90 
and this score results in 45% of the maximum annual bonus 
being paid to Executive Directors. Of the total bonus awarded, 
46.67% was with respect to delivery of financial performance 
and this will be paid in cash in March 2021. The remaining 
53.33% was with respect to the delivery of strategic objectives 
and, in accordance with the Policy, will be deferred into shares 
for the Executive Directors and which will ordinarily vest after 
three years (in 2024). There are further details about this 
outcome on pages 124 and 125.
This score also forms part of the performance assessment for 
the Performance Share Plan awards granted in March 2018. 
Further details are provided below.
Long-term assessment of performance
Awards which were granted in 2018 under the Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) were subject to performance criteria under 
the previous Policy approved by shareholders in 2018. Vesting 
for such awards over the three-year period from 1 January 2018 
to 31 December 2020 was based on two measures. These were 
Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), accounting for 50% of 
the award, and the three-year average of the Group Scorecard, 
which accounted for the remaining 50% of the award. The 
Group’s TSR over the period was between the median and  
upper quartile, leading to 74.4% vesting for this element. The 
average Group Scorecard outcome over the same period was 
0.95 leading to 40.0% vesting for this element. The overall 
vesting outcome for the 2018 PSP awards is therefore 57.2%  
of the maximum. 
The Committee determined that the vesting outcome was 
appropriate in the context of performance over the three year 
performance period and therefore no exercise of discretion was 
applied to the overall vesting. Drax’s share price at 31 December 
2020 was 39% higher than the start of the performance period, 
given the averaging periods over which TSR has been 
calculated, this equates to a return of 15% based on the six 
month averaging period prior to the start and end of the 
performance period. These returns represent a strong result  
for our shareholders, particularly in the current environment. 
110 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Remuneration Committee report continued
Performance is assessed against a broad FTSE 350 comparator 
group, for many of whom shareholder returns have been 
negative over the performance period. Although Drax’s share 
price was initially impacted by Covid-19 in early 2020, it has 
recovered strongly, with a shareholder return of 28% from 1 
January 2020 to the end of the year. The Committee is satisfied 
that Covid-19 has not impacted the performance outcome in  
a manner which unfairly favours participants, and is confident 
that this return represents genuine strong performance and 
delivery of our strategy in an extremely challenging climate.  
You can find more details on page 31.
Base salary increases
For the 2020 pay review, all Executive Directors were given  
an increase in base salary of 3%. This took effect in April 2020 
and was in line with increases applied to the wider workforce. 
For pay increases taking effect from 1 April 2021, the Committee 
has taken into consideration the current and potential further 
impact of Covid-19 on the Company, the shareholders, employees 
and wider stakeholders. Accordingly, the Committee has agreed 
to apply a 2% base salary increase for the Executive Directors, 
which is aligned with average increases for the wider workforce.
Pension
Under the new Policy approved last year, any new Executive 
Directors joining Drax would receive a pension contribution (or 
cash payment in lieu of pension contribution) that is consistent 
with those of new joiners to the wider workforce (which is 
currently 10% of base salary). 
Existing Executive Directors will retain their current pension 
contribution until 31 December 2022, which is 20% of base 
salary for Will Gardiner and 16% for Andy Skelton. From 1 January 
2023, these contribution rates will reduce in line with those  
of new joiners at that time.
LTIP
Earlier this month we announced our intention to acquire 
Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., which is subject to Drax and 
Pinnacle shareholder approval, and court and regulatory 
approvals. If the acquisition is approved, it is expected to be 
completed in Q2 or Q3 2021. It is intended that the 2021 LTIP 
grant is made on the normal timetable at the beginning of April 
2021, but the targets for the Cumulative Adjusted Earnings  
Per Share performance condition (EPS) will be set as soon as 
practicable following either, the completion of the acquisition, 
or confirmation that the acquisition will not proceed. This will 
allow the EPS target, which is cumulatively measured over the 
three year performance period, to accurately reflect the impact 
of the acquisition and to align with the shareholder experience 
over the performance period. Full information regarding the 
targets for the performance conditions for the 2021 LTIP grant 
will be announced via RNS no later than three months after  
the completion of the acquisition.
Leaving arrangements for Andy Koss
Andy Koss, CEO Generation, stood down from the Board on 
7 April 2020 and left employment with Drax on 30 June 2020, 
by reason of redundancy. Accordingly, the Committee 
concluded that “good leaver” remuneration provisions should 
apply under our Policy, as announced on 8 April 2020. We have 
provided details of his leaving arrangements on pages 126 to 
127. The Board determined that this role was no longer required 
and therefore no successor has been appointed.
Workforce engagement
I believe that engagement with stakeholders is important in both 
informing the decisions of the Committee and in communicating 
how the Committee conducts its work and reaches key 
decisions. In 2020, I met with the chairs of the MyVoice Forums 
via video conference to explain the role of the Committee, how 
executive pay is set, how it aligns with the wider workforce pay 
and Company culture, and to answer directly any questions they 
had. It was a really engaging session and the insight I gained was 
invaluable. We will aim to continue to maintain an ongoing and 
transparent dialogue with our employees.
Following this meeting, I recorded a video which was released 
to the wider workforce of Drax Group plc. I also wrote to all 
colleagues to share information, incorporating the feedback  
I had received from my engagement with shareholders. I also 
provided details of the Policy and the link to wider decisions  
on remuneration.
Committee performance
In the autumn of 2020, the performance of the Committee was 
assessed as part of an externally led Board evaluation exercise. 
As part of the scope of this exercise, the Board considered the 
composition and diversity of the Committee and how effectively 
members work together to achieve objectives and make 
decisions. I am pleased to report that the Committee is 
operating effectively, and the Board takes assurance from the 
quality of the Committee’s work. You can read more about this 
on page 95.
Summary
Along with other members of the Committee, I am proud of how 
we have kept to the principles of keeping everyone safe while 
keeping the lights on in 2020. Moreover, I am satisfied that the 
2020 remuneration outcomes for the Executive Directors and 
senior management fairly reflect the performance of the Group 
during this challenging period. These outcomes also provide a 
fair and consistent approach to remuneration across the Group 
and remain in shareholders’ interests. The Committee remains 
alert to the potential challenges which Covid-19 may bring 
through 2021 and how these might impact reward outcomes, 
consistent with our commitment made when the pandemic  
first arose. 
I hope that having read the information in this report, you will 
vote in support of the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2020 
at the AGM in April 2021.

Implementation of the Policy in 2020
Below is a summary of the key features of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy), which was approved by shareholders at the 
2020 AGM and so became effective from that meeting. There is also a summary of how the Committee applied the Policy in 2020.
Element
Key features of the Policy (adopted in 2020)
Implementation of Policy in 2020
Base salary
• The Committee targets market level, as determined by 
reference to appropriate comparator companies selected 
with consideration for factors such as sector, size and 
international presence.
• An Executive Director in post at the start of the Policy 
period, and who remains in the same role throughout  
the Policy period, would normally receive an increase  
in line with the average annual percentage increase  
in base salary of all other employees in the Group.
• For the pay increases made in April 2020, all Executive 
Directors received an increase in base salary of 3%.
• These increases were in line with increases applied  
to the wider workforce.
Pension and 
other benefits
• An Executive Director is entitled to a contribution to  
the Group’s defined contribution pension plan, a cash 
payment in lieu of pension, or a combination of pension 
contribution and cash in lieu of pension.
• Until 31 December 2022, the pension contribution rates 
for existing Executive Directors are 20% of base salary for 
Will Gardiner and 16% for Andy Skelton. From 1 January 
2023, the contribution rates will be aligned to those of 
new joiners (which is currently 10%).
• Other benefits provided as appropriate.
• The employer pension contribution in 2020 for Will 
Gardiner and Andy Koss (up to the date of his departure) 
was 20% of base salary, and it was 16% for Andy Skelton.
• Will Gardiner’s employer contribution is delivered as cash 
in lieu, whereas for Andy Koss (up to the date of his 
departure) and Andy Skelton, it is delivered in part 
pension contribution and part as cash in lieu.
• Other benefits received included a car benefit, life 
assurance, income protection, the opportunity to 
participate in all-employee share plans on the same basis 
as other employees, annual private health assessment 
and annual private medical cover.
Annual bonus
• The maximum opportunity is 175% of base salary for  
Will Gardiner and 150% for other Executive Directors.
• 60% of the bonus award is measured on financial metrics, 
and 40% on strategic metrics.
• Bonus earned for the strategic metrics is deferred, but 
total bonus outcome is subject to a minimum of a 40% 
deferral. The portion of bonus which is deferred into 
shares is subject to a three-year vesting period and which 
must be retained for a further two years.
• Clawback and malus provisions apply.
• The 2020 annual bonus outcome as a percentage  
of maximum opportunity was 45%, of which 21% was 
based on performance against financial metrics and  
24% against strategic metrics.
• The strategic element of the bonus outcome (which is 
equivalent to 53.33% of the total bonus award) will be 
deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Plan.

Key features of the Policy (adopted in 2020)
Implementation of Policy in 2020
Long term  
incentive
• For awards made under the LTIP which was introduced in 
2020, the maximum award level is 200% of base salary 
for Will Gardiner and 175% for other Executive Directors.
• Vesting is subject to long term performance conditions, 
measured over a three-year performance period.
• Shares must be retained for a further two years from 
vesting.
• Clawback and malus provisions apply.
• The 2020 LTIP award is based on the three-year 
performance period to 31 December 2022, based on Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 350, which has 
a 50% weighting, and Cumulative Adjusted EPS (EPS), 
which also has a 50% weighting.
• The 2018 PSP (granted under the provisions of the 2018 
Remuneration Policy) will vest at 57.2% of the maximum 
and was based on the performance of TSR relative to 
FTSE 350 (50% weighting) and the average Group 
Scorecard outcome of the preceding three performance 
years (50% weighting).
Shareholding 
requirement
• The requirement is 250% of base salary for Will Gardiner 
and 200% for other Executive Directors.
• A post-cessation shareholding requirement, equal to  
the employment shareholding requirement, applies for  
a two-year period after cessation. Only shares for awards 
granted after the 2020 AGM will be included.
• Will Gardiner has met the shareholding requirement,  
with a shareholding at the date of this report equivalent 
to 369% of base salary, which includes 296,760 shares  
he acquired in the open market.
• Andy Skelton is working towards meeting the shareholding 
requirement and has a shareholding as at the date of the 
report of 174% of base salary, which comprises 142,976 
shares which he acquired in the open market.
• Andy Koss stepped down as a Director on 7 April 2020, 
which was before the current Policy was approved by 
shareholders on 22 April 2020. His shareholding at the 
date of stepping down was 52% of base salary.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy – approved by shareholders in 2020
The current Directors Remuneration Policy (Policy) was approved by our shareholders at the AGM held on 22 April 2020 and 
therefore became effective from that date and will be binding until the close of the 2023 AGM, unless varied by shareholders 
at a General Meeting prior to then. The Policy is set out in full in this section.
The scenario charts have been updated to reflect fixed pay expectations for 2021 and the impact on the annual bonus and 
LTIP awards.
Base salary
Base salary helps to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of Executive Director to deliver the leadership and 
management needed to execute the Group’s strategy and business plan.
Practical operation
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and 
experience, and market level. To determine the market level, 
the Committee reviews remuneration data on executive 
positions at companies which the Committee considers to  
be appropriate comparators. The comparator companies are 
selected, with advice from the Committee’s remuneration 
advisers, taking into account factors such as, but not limited 
to, sector, size, and international presence.
On appointment, an Executive Director’s base salary is set  
at the market level, or below if the executive is not fully 
experienced at this level. Where base salary on appointment 
is below market level to reflect experience, it will be 
increased over time to align with the market level, subject  
to performance.
Base salaries of all Executive Directors are generally 
reviewed once each year, with increases applying from April. 
Reviews cover individual performance, experience, 
development in the role, market comparisons and pay 
reviews for the wider workforce.
Maximum potential value
The base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the start 
of the policy period, and who remain in the same role 
throughout the policy period, will not usually be increased  
by a higher percentage than the average annual percentage 
increase in salaries of all other employees in the Group.
Exceptions to this, subject to performance and development, 
are where:
(i) An Executive Director has been appointed at below 
market level to reflect experience. Under this scenario, 
increases will be capped at 5% above the average annual 
percentage increase in salaries of all other Group 
employees.
(ii) An Executive Director has been promoted internally (or 
the scope or nature of their role has changed) and their 
salary is below market level. Under this scenario, increases 
will not be capped and the Committee can increase base 
salary to the market level within an appropriate 
timeframe.

Annual bonus
The award of annual bonus will be based on annual performance against financial and operational measures linked to the 
business plan. The aim of the deferred portion of the annual bonus is to further align executives to shareholders’ interests,  
by linking share-based reward to long-term sustainable performance.
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
The maximum opportunity will be split between two 
elements:
Financial element – performance is based on financial and 
operational metrics. This element represents 105% of salary 
for the CEO and 90% of salary for other Executive Directors. 
Subject to the minimum level of deferral noted below, this 
element will be paid in cash.
Strategic element – performance is based on strategic and 
other non-financial metrics. This element will represent 70% 
of salary for the CEO and 60% of salary for other Executive 
Directors. This element will be paid in shares deferred for  
a period of three years.
A minimum of 40% of the total bonus outcome will be 
deferred into shares in the form of nil cost options under the 
Deferred Share Plan (DSP), regardless of the pay outcomes  
of the financial and strategic elements. If this amount is not 
attained by the strategic element, a portion of the financial 
element will also be deferred into shares in order to achieve 
this minimum level of deferral.
A two-year holding period applies to DSP awards post-
vesting, during which Executive Directors may not sell  
the shares, except to pay any tax due.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume 
notional reinvestment) are paid on DSP awards.
There is no payment for below threshold performance.  
The outcome for threshold performance is 0% of maximum. 
The outcome for target performance is 50% of maximum.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus 
and clawback to cash bonus awards.
Targets, outcomes and resulting payouts are published in  
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee will review the formulaic outcome of the 
bonus award and has the discretion to amend the final 
outcome to make sure that bonus payments reflect overall 
performance. The use of such discretion will be explained 
fully in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.

Performance measures
The performance conditions applicable to the annual bonus 
awards are split between the two elements:
Financial element – performance measures based on annual 
financial and operational targets, which will be linked directly 
to the performance of the Group and determined by the 
Board. The Committee may amend the measures used each 
year in line with business strategy.
Strategic element – performance measures based on 
non-financial and strategic targets, which will be determined 
annually by the Board and will be aligned with the business 
strategy.
The weighting of the respective elements is 60% on financial 
elements and 40% on strategic elements. The Committee 
has the discretion to vary the weightings from year to year.
In exceptional circumstances such that the Committee 
believes the original measures and/or targets are no longer 
appropriate, the Committee has discretion to amend 
performance measures and targets during the year.
114 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Group’s LTIP provides long-term alignment with shareholders based on the outcomes of Relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) and Cumulative Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS).
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
Under the LTIP, Executive Directors may at the discretion  
of the Committee receive an annual grant of shares.
Shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject  
to continued service or in exceptional circumstances earlier 
subject to specified “good leaver” termination provisions,  
and the achievement of performance conditions over a three 
year period determined by the Committee. Vested awards  
are then subject to a further holding period of two years for 
Executive Directors.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume 
notional reinvestment) may be paid on LTIP awards.
There is no payment for below threshold performance.  
The outcome for threshold performance is 25% of maximum.
The Committee will include an override provision in each 
grant under the LTIP. This will give the Committee discretion 
to determine that no vesting shall occur, or that vesting shall 
be reduced, if there are circumstances (relating to the 
Group’s overall performance or otherwise) which make 
vesting when calculated by reference to the performance 
conditions alone inappropriate.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus or 
clawback to unvested/vested awards, as set out in the notes 
to the policy table.
The Committee reserves discretion to:
(i) amend the performance conditions/targets attached  
to outstanding awards granted under this Policy, in the 
event of a major corporate event or significant change  
in economic circumstances, or a change in accounting 
standards having a material impact on outcomes; and
(ii) adjust the vesting of LTIP awards and/or the number  
of shares underlying unvested LTIP awards, on the 
occurrence of a corporate event or other reorganisation. 
In the event of a change of control, the treatment of 
long-term incentives will be determined in accordance 
with the plan rules.

CEO
200%
Other Executive Directors

In exceptional circumstances the Committee may on 
recruitment grant a percentage of salary in excess of  
these amounts. Further detail is provided on page 119.
Performance measures
Two performance measures apply to LTIP awards and they 
are as follows:
(i) TSR performance over three years relative to the  
FTSE 350 (50% of award), vesting as follows:
 
Below Median = 0% of maximum 
Median = 25% of maximum 
Upper Quartile = 100% of maximum
(ii) Cumulative Adjusted EPS performance over three years, 
(50% of award), vesting as follows:
 
Below Threshold = 0% of maximum 
Threshold = 25% of maximum 
Maximum = 100% of maximum
Straight line vesting occurs between performance levels  
for both conditions.

Pension
Pension provision is one of the components to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of executive, to ensure delivery  
of the leadership and management needed to execute the Group’s purpose and strategy.
Practical operation
Executive Directors are entitled to a contribution to the 
Group’s defined contribution pension plan, a cash payment 
in lieu of pension (subject to normal statutory deductions), 
or a combination of pension contributions and cash in lieu 
of pension.
Maximum potential value
Existing Executive Directors will receive the following 
pension contribution rates until 31 December 2022.
• CEO – 20% of salary
• CFO – 16% of salary
From 1 January 2023, the contribution rates for existing 
Executive Directors will be aligned with the rate for new 
joiners to the wider workforce (currently 10% of salary). 
The pension contribution rate for any new Executive Director 
will be aligned with the wider workforce rate from the date of 
appointment.
Performance measures
No performance measures apply.
Benefits
Benefits are provided to be market competitive as an integral part of Executive Directors’ total remuneration.
Practical operation
Executive Directors receive a car benefit, life assurance, 
income protection, the opportunity to participate in all-
employee share plans on the same basis as other employees, 
annual private health assessment and annual private 
medical cover. Additional benefits may be provided if the 
Committee considers them appropriate.
Relocation expenses are paid, where appropriate, in 
individual cases. Executive Directors’ relocation expenses 
are determined on a case-by-case basis. The Policy is 
designed to assist the Executive Director to relocate to a 
home of similar standing.
Maximum potential value
Benefits are set at a level appropriate to the individual’s role 
and circumstances.
The maximum opportunity will depend on the type of benefit 
and cost of its provision, which will vary according to the 
market and individual circumstances.
Performance measures
No performance measures apply.
116 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Shareholding requirement
The shareholding requirement aligns the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders.
Practical operation
The shareholding requirement for the CEO is 250% of salary 
and for the other Executive Directors is 200% of salary. This 
is to be achieved within a period five years after the date  
of the 2020 AGM (or after the date of appointment for new 
Executive Directors if this is later) from vested shares derived 
from awards under the Company’s share plans.
Until this level is reached, Executive Directors who receive 
shares by virtue of any share plan award or who receive DSP 
awards are expected to retain 50% of the shares received net 
(i.e. after income tax and national insurance contributions). 
Shares which have not vested and are subject to performance 
conditions will not count towards the requirement. Unvested 
awards subject to service only (e.g. DSP awards) will count 
towards the guideline on a net of tax basis.
Shares vesting in respect of awards granted after the 2020 
AGM will be held in the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust until 
the shareholding requirement is met and all share disposals 
will be subject to the Company’s share dealing code. 
Maximum potential value
N/A
Performance measures
N/A
Post cessation shareholding requirement
The Group’s post-cessation shareholding requirement aligns the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders over  
the longer term beyond their departure from the Group.
Practical operation
A post-cessation shareholding requirement, equal to the 
employment shareholding requirement (or the shareholding 
on departure if lower) applies for a two year period after 
cessation of employment. For clarity, the post-cessation 
shareholding requirement is 250% of salary for the CEO  
and for the other Executive Directors is 200% of salary. In 
addition, shares vesting during this period will remain subject 
to the two-year post-vesting holding period, which may 
therefore extend beyond the two-year period for which the 
post-cessation shareholding requirement applies.
Only shares relating to awards which are granted after the 
date of the 2020 AGM will be included for the purposes of 
this requirement. Shares purchased by the Executive 
Director (including those from all employee share plans),  
will not be included.
Shares counting towards this requirement will not be 
released from the Employee Benefit Trust during the period in 
which the post-cessation shareholding requirement applies, 
to support enforceability. Acceptance of the post-cessation 
shareholding requirement will be a condition of participation 
in all share awards granted after the 2020 AGM and will be 
included in the grant documentation for awards.
Both Will Gardiner and Andy Skelton have entered into such 
an agreement.

Performance measures and approach to setting targets
The measures for elements of variable pay will be:
• In respect of the annual bonus plan, financial, strategic and operational measures consisting of targets set by the Committee 
each year in conjunction with the Board. The targets are aligned with key business goals determined at the start of each year
• In respect of shares granted under the LTIP from April 2020, a combination of:
 
– Relative TSR, which aligns Executive Director remuneration with creation of long-term shareholder value;
 
– Cumulative Adjusted EPS, which aligns Executive Director remuneration with the realisation of our earnings growth plans, 
which is a major determinant of shareholder value.
• The Committee sets targets for the performance measures each year, taking into account market conditions, the business plan 
and other circumstances as appropriate. A summary of the measures that apply for the following year are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Elements of previous policy that will continue
Remuneration component and link to 
strategy
Performance Share Plan awards made 
in 2019 link long-term share-based 
incentives to TSR and to the 
achievement of Business Plan 
strategic targets.
Practical operation
Vesting is subject to achievement of 
performance conditions and 
continued service or “good leaver” 
termination provisions. Further details 
of the terms were included in the 
relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration at the time of grant.
Performance measures
Vesting of conditional awards is 
subject to relative TSR performance 
and average Group Scorecard 
outcome over three years.
DSP awards made in 2019 and 2020 
until they vest three years later or 
lapse, as applicable.
Vesting is subject to continued service 
or “good leaver” termination provisions. 
Further details of the terms of the 
awards were included in the relevant 
Annual Report on Remuneration at the 
time of grant.
N/A
Circumstances in which malus or clawback may apply
Malus and clawback for the annual bonus – the Committee may reduce the performance outcome, or may require an 
Executive Director to repay any amount of cash bonus it considers appropriate, in circumstances of:
• material financial misstatement;
• fraud or misconduct;
• material failure of risk management and corporate failure;
• if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information;
• in other circumstances that the Committee considers justifying the operation of the clawback provision.
The clawback period is two years from the date a bonus is paid. If a repayment of bonus is required, the Committee may 
reduce the number of shares that may vest under the DSP or LTIP arrangements by an appropriate amount.
The Committee may also reduce the number of shares, or clawback shares for a two year period commencing on vesting 
under an LTIP and/or DSP awards in circumstances of:
• material financial misstatement
• fraud or misconduct
• material failure of risk management and corporate failure
• if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information
• in other circumstances that the Committee considers justifying the operation of these provisions
If a repayment of a share award is required, the Committee may reduce the number of shares that may vest under the DSP  
or LTIP arrangements, and/or may reduce the amount of any annual bonus by an appropriate amount.
118 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Committee’s judgement and discretion
In addition to assessing and making judgements on the meeting of performance targets and the appropriate incentives 
payable, the Committee has certain operational discretions it can exercise in relation to Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
These include, but are not limited to:
• reviewing the formulaic outcome of the cash bonus, DSP and LTIP awards and applying discretion to amend the final outcomes, 
to ensure that the outcomes reflect overall performance or an individual executive’s performance;
• deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award;
• determining whether a leaver is a “good leaver”.
Where such discretion is exercised, it will be explained in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration scenarios

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will apply the components set out in the table on pages 112 to 118 to determine the remuneration of newly 
appointed Executive Directors. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Executive 
Director being appointed. Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the market level, 
subject to good performance. The incentive provision for a new Executive Director will include an annual bonus of up to 150% 
of salary, or 175% of salary for the CEO, with financial and strategic elements as set out in the Policy table above, and an LTIP 
award of up to 175% of salary, or 200% of salary for the CEO (in exceptional circumstances the Committee may on recruitment 
grant a percentage of salary in excess of these amounts but in such circumstances it would be capped at 300% of salary). 
The Committee may also determine it appropriate to honour prevailing contract commitments for an individual in the event 
they are promoted to an Executive Director position.
In relation to Executive Directors appointed from outside the Group, where the Committee considers it to be necessary to 
secure the appointment of the Executive Director, the Committee may:
• pay compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share incentives 
(subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the Group’s right  
to claw back any amount which is subsequently paid to the Executive Director by the former employer, and to claw back  
an appropriate proportion of the payment if the Executive Director leaves soon after appointment). Any compensation made 
will not exceed the value of the benefits lost as determined by the Committee acting fairly and reasonably;
• agree a rate for employer pensions contributions, or salary supplements in lieu of pension contribution, which reflects the 
contribution rate for the wider workforce at the date of appointment;
• make appropriate payments in circumstances where an Executive Director is relocated from outside the UK.
Service agreements and termination
Executive Directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
notice. They are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office.
Element
Details
Notice periods
Executive Directors may be required to work during the notice period or may be provided with pay in lieu 
of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Under each of the Executive Directors’ service agreements, the Group has the right to make a payment  
in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have 
accrued to the Executive Director during the contractual notice period. For the avoidance of any doubt 
this excludes any performance bonus (or cash equivalent) for the relevant period of unworked notice.
Compensation 
for loss of 
office
If an Executive Director’s employment is brought to an end by either party, and if the Committee considers 
that it is necessary to pay the Executive Director a termination payment, the Committee’s policy, in the 
absence of a breach of the service agreement by the Executive Director, is to determine an Executive 
Director’s termination payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The termination payment 
will be calculated based on the value of base salary and contractual benefits that would have accrued to 
the Executive Director during the contractual notice period. The Committee will seek mitigation to reduce 
the amount of any termination payment to a leaving Executive Director when appropriate to do so, having 
regard to the circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may, for example, be appropriate to 
consider mitigation if the Executive Director has secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would 
not apply retrospectively to a contractual payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, the Executive Director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights.  
The Group may pay reasonable fees for a departing Executive Director to obtain independent legal advice 
in relation to their termination arrangements and nominal consideration for agreement to any contractual 
terms protecting the Group’s rights following termination. No service agreement includes any provision 
for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances 
would need to be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.

Treatment of 
annual bonus 
on termination
All bonus payments are discretionary. The Committee will consider whether a departing Executive 
Director should receive a cash bonus and deferred share award in respect of the financial year in which, 
and/or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated to reflect the period of the 
performance year completed at the date of termination. The Committee will take into account 
performance; the reason for termination; cooperation with succession; any breach of goodwill; adherence 
to contractual obligations/restrictions; and any other factors which they believe should be taken into 
account. The service contract for Will Gardiner as CEO, does not entitle him to any payment of bonus  
on termination of employment.
If the employment ends in any of the following circumstances, the Executive Director will be treated  
as a “good leaver” and the Executive Director will be eligible for an annual bonus:
• redundancy;
• retirement;
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Group;
• death.
If the termination is for any other reason, an award will be at the Committee’s discretion and it is the 
Committee’s policy to ensure that any such award properly reflects the departing Executive Director’s 
performance and behaviour towards the Group. Therefore the amount of any such award will be 
determined, taking into account (i) the Executive Director’s personal performance and behaviour towards 
the Group and (ii) the Group’s performance.
If an award is made, it will normally be paid/granted as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Group 
performance element has been determined for the relevant period. There may be circumstances in which 
the Committee considers it appropriate for the award to be made earlier, for example, on termination due 
to ill-health, in which case, on-target performance shall be assumed.
Treatment of 
unvested 
long-term 
incentive and 
deferred share 
awards on 
termination
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the 
Executive Director under the DSP and LTIP should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee  
will be in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
In summary, the rules of the LTIP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date of employment 
termination) if employment ends for any of the following reasons (“long-term good leaver reasons”):
• redundancy;
• retirement;
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Company;
• death;
• change of control.
If employment ends for any other reason, the participant may be deemed a “good leaver” at the 
Committee’s discretion. In doing so, it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, the 
Group’s performance; the Executive Director’s performance and behaviour towards the Group during  
the performance cycle of the relevant awards; and other relevant factors, including the proximity of  
the award to its maturity date.
Awards which vest subject to satisfaction of performance conditions, will be time pro-rated, and will 
ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date subject to the post-vesting shareholding period.
The rules of the DSP provide that deferred bonus awards will vest (in full) if employment ends for any  
of the good leaver reasons detailed above. If employment ends for any other reason, the participant may 
be deemed a “good leaver” at the Committee’s discretion. In doing so it will take account of all relevant 
circumstances, in particular, the Group’s performance; the Executive Director’s performance and 
behaviour towards the Group during the performance cycle of the relevant awards, and a range of  
other relevant factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
The rules of the DSP and LTIP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, they do so at the 
normal vesting date, unless the Committee exercises discretion to vest awards earlier.
Outside 
appointments
Executive Directors may accept external Board appointments, subject to the Chair’s approval.  
Normally only one appointment to a listed company would be approved. Fees may be retained by  
the Executive Director.

Consideration of circumstances for leavers
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving Executive Director is fair  
and appropriate, taking account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may  
be minded to award a cash bonus, DSP award and/or permit the vesting of LTIP and/or DSP awards include:
• the Executive Director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice;
• the Executive Director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements.
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is (for example)  
due to poor performance or if the Executive Director does not continue to perform appropriately following notice.

Practical operation
Maximum potential value
Fees
To attract a Chair and 
independent Non-
Executive Directors 
who, together with the 
Executive Directors, form 
a Board with a broad 
range of skills and 
experience.
The Chair’s remuneration is determined by the 
Committee whilst that of the other Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Chair and the Executive 
Directors. These are determined in the light of:
• fees of the Chair and Non-Executive Directors of other 
listed companies selected for comparator purposes,  
on the same basis as for Executive Directors;
• the responsibilities and time commitment;
• the need to attract and retain individuals with the 
necessary skills and experience.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are reviewed periodically 
against market comparators.
Non-Executive Directors receive an annual base fee. 
Additional annual fees are paid:
• to the Senior Independent Director (which includes the 
fee for chairing a Board Committee other than the Audit 
Committee);
• to the Chair of the Audit Committee;
• to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee;
• to the Chair of any other committee (this is not paid to 
the Chair of the Nomination Committee if he or she is 
also the Chair of the Board).
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to participate  
in any performance related remuneration arrangements.
Overall aggregate fees paid to all 
Non-Executive Directors will remain 
within the limit as stated in the 
Company’s Articles (currently 
£1,000,000).
Expenses
Reasonable travel and accommodation expenses are 
reimbursed as applicable.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus, pension 
or any of the Group’s share-based reward plans.
The Chair’s notice period is six months whilst the other Non-Executive Directors have a notice period of one month. Further 
information on the service agreements of the Non-Executive Directors can be found on page 129.

Differences between the policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally
The following differences apply between the remuneration of Executive Directors and the policy on the remuneration  
of employees generally:
• Executive Directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for LTIP awards, although there are differences in the 
quantum of the grants that are made;
• Annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, but deferral of bonuses into DSP awards applies only to Executive Directors;
• Employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus, subject to the Group’s 
performance and continued employment, whereas Executive Directors and all other UK-based employees participate in  
a discretionary bonus plan;
• Employer pension contribution (or salary supplement) are up to 10% of salary for new joiners from 1 July 2019, irrespective  
of seniority. There are legacy pension contribution arrangements which continue to be in operation for employees who joined 
prior to 1 July 2019. From 1 January 2023 the contribution rates for existing Executive Directors will be aligned with the rate  
for new joiners to the wider workforce (currently 10% of salary);
• In some cases hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments.
Context
Wider employee population
In determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases 
within the Group. Employees are not directly consulted on the Policy, however as referenced on page 110, there are a number 
of existing channels designed to capture the views of the workforce on remuneration, including the MyVoice forums.
The Committee’s policy is that annual salary increases for Executive Directors should not exceed the average annual salary 
increase for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the 
nature or scope of responsibilities or if an Executive Director has been appointed at a salary below market level reflecting 
experience in the role.
The Committee also considers external market benchmarking to inform executive remuneration decisions. External market 
benchmarking is also considered in relation to remuneration decisions of the wider workforce.
Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting  
the remuneration of Executive Directors. Specific measures can be included in the strategic element of the annual bonus. 
The Committee is also able to consider these issues in determining whether to exercise its discretion to adjust formulaic 
outcomes of the annual bonus and LTIP.

Notes:
(1) 
Base salary is the amount earned in 2020 and in 2019.
(2) Benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance and permanent health insurance.
(3)  Bonus is value of the award from the 2019 and 2020 annual bonus plans. It includes the value of bonus deferred and paid in shares after three years subject only  
to continued service.
(4)  Represents the value of the 2018 PSP award which should vest in March 2021, together with the dividend shares in relation to those vested shares. The value of the 
award is calculated based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2020, which was £3.187. The value of the award attributable to share price appreciation 
for Will Gardiner is £132,112. This is based on the growth in the value of the shares due to vest (excluding dividend shares) from the grant share price (£2.552) to the 
average share price over the quarter to 31 December 2020 (£3.187).
(5) 2019 numbers (for the 2017 PSP award) are restated to reflect the actual share price on vesting of £1.954 on 15 May 2020.
(6)   Represents the value of the Sharesave Awards granted in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The 2020 Sharesave Awards are based on the share price on grant (£1.588) 
less the exercise price (£1.271).
(7) Andy Skelton joined on 2 January 2019 and therefore was not granted an award under the 2017 or 2018 PSP.
(8)  Andy Koss stepped down from the Board on 7 April 2020 and therefore in the table above the remuneration he earned in 2020 is in respect of the period 1 January 
2020 to 7 April 2020. The bonus Andy earned with respect of the period 8 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 is outlined in the payment for loss of office section of this 
report, along with other details of his loss of office payments. Andy’s 2018 PSP award should vest in March 2021 and has been excluded from the single figure table 
as the performance period ended after he stepped down from the Board. For further information refer to the payment for loss of office section of this report.

The targets were aligned with the Group’s strategy and 2020 Business Plan and reviewed regularly by the Board as part of their 
ongoing scrutiny of business and executive performance. The targets were set at the start of the financial year, prior to the 
outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. No adjustment to the performance targets has been made. Outlined below is a brief synopsis  
of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used and their strategic rationale.
• Group adjusted EBITDA – was our principal financial metric, combining the underlying performance of each business to give a Group 
outcome. Group adjusted EBITDA for 2020 was £412 million relative to a target and budget of £460 million. Unfortunately, Drax fell 
below the low end of this range (score of 0). However, in the context of impacts of Covid-19, this was a relatively strong performance. 
The outturn of this metric was part of the Group’s independent financial audit.
• Cost of Production – reducing the cost of biomass production will make a positive contribution to the Group’s financial performance 
in the medium term and beyond 2027. Despite many challenges that 2020 brought to the southern US region including hurricanes, 
tornadoes and Covid-19, Drax Biomass was still able to deliver a cost of production of 8.61, which was below the target for the year  
of 8.71 (score of 1.2). 
• Customers business contribution – driving profitability is the key priority of focus for our Customers business. Unfortunately, Drax fell 
below the low end of the target range which was set but this was wholly due to the impacts of Covid-19 (score of 0).
• Average net debt – a structural reduction in debt is a key objective for the Group with progress assessed against weighted average 
net debt targets measured within the financial year. Average net debt was £849 million, and thereby beating the stretch target of 
£860 million (score of 2). 
• Safety – safety is a key priority for the business and in the 2020 Scorecard it was measured against Total Recordable Incident Rate 
(TRIR), which is defined as the number of incidents per 100,000 hours worked. The TRIR score was 0.29, which unfortunately was 
below the threshold target of 0.27 (score of 0). In 2020, all teams had to contend with Covid-19 mitigations in the workplace, which 
have been changing in line with rapid updates in UK Government policy. In addition, across the Group, we are pleased to report that 
there were no major impact environmental or process safety events.

• Progress on Strategic Projects – progress on key projects are of critical importance for Drax in progressing the Group’s strategy.  
There were two projects which were included in this metric. The first was the delivery of the Morehouse Bioenergy Expansion, which 
would increase the capacity of the plant whilst also supporting reduced cost of production for pellets. We are pleased to report that 
the project was completed successfully, and it was completed in line with all key targets which were set. The second was progress  
on advancing our BECCS strategy. Substantial progress was made in 2020, across all critical path activities of our BECCS strategy.  
The choice of projects, and the assessment of the performance of them in 2020 was subject to approval of the Board (score of 1.5).
• Environmental, employee and sustainability practices, and our reputation, are a critical part of our values, vision and how Drax will 
create long-term sustainable returns for shareholders. In 2020 the assessment of our environmental practices was derived from  
the Group’s 2020 CDP rating, which supports our commitment around tackling climate change. This is combined with independent 
ratings of how well we engage and support our employees and independent ratings of our reputation and sustainable business 
practices, which formed the basis of this metric. In assessing the performance of this metric the Committee reviewed quantitative 
outcomes, such as the assessment prepared by an external agency tracking reputation, and determined an overall score of 1.63.
The Committee completed an in-depth review of the score for each of the performance measures, ensuring these were individually 
appropriate, and then reviewed the overall outcome, to determine whether to exercise its discretion and adjust the final score.  
The Committee also considered the impact of Covid-19 on the Group’s performance and felt that the outcomes were reflective  
of the Group’s strong financial and strategic performance, as well as wider employee and shareholder experiences. No discretion 
was exercised by the Committee in determining the bonus outcome. The Committee approved the Group Scorecard result for 2020 
at a meeting held on 23 February 2021, subject to the final approval of the financial results and Annual report and accounts by the 
Directors on 24 February 2021.

DSP awards granted in 2020 (audited information)
The table below shows the deferred share awards granted under the Deferred Share Plan (DSP) to Executive Directors on 30 March 
2020 in respect of bonus earned for performance in 2019. Awards will vest after three years subject to continued service only.

Note:

 The number of shares awarded was based on the average share price in the three-day period prior to grant, which was £1.5657. In accordance with the DSP rules, 
dividends in respect of the deferred shares are reinvested in additional shares, which vest when the deferred shares vest.
Sharesave options granted in 2020 (audited information)
On 15 April 2020 grants of Sharesave options were made to Will Gardiner and to Andy Skelton (23,603 shares each). The exercise 
price is £1.271, which represents a 20% discount to the prevailing share price at the time of offer, and is the same for all employees 
who elected to participate in the Sharesave. The face value of the awards was £43,689 for both Will Gardiner and Andy Skelton, 
which is based on the share price of £1.851 on 15 April 2020. The options will vest after five years subject to continued service and 
continued contributions.
Pension entitlements for defined contribution schemes (audited information)
Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution to the Group’s defined contribution pension plan, cash in lieu of pension 
contributions or a mixture of these. The employer contribution for Will Gardiner in 2020 was 20% of base salary, as was the 
employer contribution for Andy Koss until he left Drax on 30 June 2020. The employer contribution for Andy Skelton was 16%.  
Will Gardiner’s employer contribution is delivered as cash in lieu of pension, whereas for Andy Skelton it is delivered in part as 
contributions to Group pension plan and part as cash in lieu (this was the same for Andy Koss). No Executive Director was a  
member of a defined benefit pension scheme.
Payments to former directors (audited information)
Dorothy Thompson, former CEO, was entitled to pro-rata vesting of a PSP award made in 2017. A total of 12,617 shares vested in  
May 2020, including dividend shares, based on performance vesting of 18%, as outlined in last year’s report. Of this, 5,348 shares 
were sold to cover tax and the balance of 7,269 shares were subject to a two-year holding period and will be held in trust on her 
behalf and eligible for release in May 2022.
Payments for loss of office (audited information)
Andy Koss stepped down from the Board on 7 April 2020. Andy’s employment was terminated on the grounds of redundancy  
and he continued to be employed until 30 June 2020 (the termination date) as a special adviser to Will Gardiner in order to provide 
leadership on a programme of works and to ensure an orderly transition. For the period from 8 April 2020 up to his termination 
date, Andy received the following payments:
• Salary of £80,517.
• Payment in lieu of pension of £16,103.
• Benefits of £3,766 (car allowance and continued coverage under the Company’s private medical and insured benefits plans).

Shareholder information
On termination Andy received a redundancy payment of £10,222, calculated in accordance with the statutory formula, and a 
payment in respect of his untaken accrued holiday of £21,664. He was also entitled to payment in lieu of the remainder of his  
12 months’ notice period (“PILON”) which had not elapsed as at the date of his termination date (the period of 1 July 2020 to 7 April 
2021), in respect of base salary, pension and other benefits (car allowance and insured benefits). In accordance with the terms  
of his service agreement, the PILON payment was to be made in three instalments. The first instalment of PILON, equal to 50%  
of the total payment, was paid to him within 30 days of the termination date. The total payment for the first instalment was 
£167,061 and it consisted of:
• Salary of £134,430.
• Payment in lieu of pension of £26,886.
• Benefits of £5,745 (car allowance and insured benefits).
As Andy found alternative employment during the unexpired period of the 12 months’ notice period, payments for the second  
and third instalments of PILON (for the remaining 50%) were not paid.
Finally, from his date of termination, Andy’s outstanding Sharesave options (8,551 shares) became exercisable for a period of  
six months. 
As Andy’s employment was terminated on the grounds of redundancy, he was treated as a good leaver under the rules of the Annual 
Bonus Plan, DSP and PSP, as set out in the Remuneration Policy. For the period of 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020, Andy earned  
a pro-rata annual bonus award of £116,149 (of which £54,349 is attributable to the period 8 April 2020 to 30 June 2020) as follows:
• Financial elements: £54,203, to be paid in cash.
• Strategic elements: £61,946, to be deferred as an award under the DSP, vesting in the normal timescales in accordance with the rules 
of the DSP.
Outstanding awards under the DSP and PSP will vest at the same time as other participants’ awards. The outstanding PSP awards 
will be pro-rated for completed months of service between the grant date and 30 June 2020 and will be subject to performance 
measured at the end of the performance period. Vested shares will be subject to the two-year post-vesting holding period, where 
required by the relevant Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited information)
The shareholding guidelines under the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy require Executive Directors who receive shares  
by virtue of share plan awards, or who receive deferred bonus share awards under the DSP, to retain 50% of the shares received  
net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance contributions) until the value held is equal to at least 250% of salary for the CEO 
and 200% of salary for other Executive Directors. Only shares that are not subject to performance conditions count towards the 
threshold (shares owned by the Director and unvested awards subject to service only – DSP awards – on a net of tax basis). As at  
31 December 2020, or the date of ceasing to be a Director if earlier, the shareholding guidelines were as detailed in the table below:

Percentage change in Directors’ remuneration compared with the wider employee population
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Directors’ salary/fees, benefits and bonus (where applicable) between 
2019 and 2020 compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for a group of 
employees. There are several employer entities but no employees who are specifically employed by Drax Group plc. As a result,  
the Committee has selected all Group employees below Executive Director level based in the UK, as the vast majority of employees 
are based in the UK and this provides the most appropriate comparison.

 Andy Koss stepped down from the Board on 7 April 2020 and continued to be employed until 30 June 2020. In this table his remuneration has been annualised  
to provide a representative comparison.
The Non Executive Directors only receive a fee and the existing fees were unchanged in 2020. The average base salary increase 
resulting from the April 2020 pay review was 3% for the wider workforce, which was the same base salary increase which Will 
Gardiner, Andy Skelton and Andy Koss received. With respect to taxable benefits, there were no material change to Drax’s existing 
benefits policies in 2020, both respect to benefits offered and level of cover. The bonus opportunities for all employees except the 
Executive Directors were unchanged in 2020, and the 2020 Scorecard outcome was the same as the 2019 Scorecard outcome 
(0.90). The bonus opportunity for Will Gardiner increased from 150% of salary to 175% in 2020, and for Andy Skelton and Andy Koss  
it increased from 140% to 150%.

The outturn of this KPI is part of the Group’s independent financial audit
The methodology used for calculating the 2019 and 2020 pay ratios was the same. The total remuneration of all UK employees  
of the Group on 31 December 2020 has been calculated on a full-time (and full-year) equivalent basis using the single figure 
methodology and reflects their actual earnings for 2020. The only exception is for employees with Defined Benefit (DB) pensions, 
where the employer contribution to the respective schemes has been used in the calculation (rather than the single figure 
methodology) to reduce the administrative complexity. This is likely to undervalue the DB pension value. No adjustments (other 
than to achieve full-time and full-year equivalent rates) were made and no components of remuneration have been omitted. Of  
the three options permitted to calculate the percentiles, the Committee has chosen option A (the calculation of the total pay and 
benefits for 2020 for all UK employees on an FTE basis), as we believe it is the most robust and most statistically accurate method 
of the options permitted and it is in line with the preference of BEIS.
Set out in the table below is the base salary and the total pay and benefits for each of the identified employees.

£76,968
Base salaries of all employees, including Executive Directors, are set with reference to a range of factors including market practice, 
experience and performance in role. The CEO has a larger portion of his pay based on performance of the business than the 
individuals at P25, P50 and P75. The Committee believe that our senior executives should have a significant portion of their pay 
directly linked to the performance of the business, but recognise that this does mean the pay ratios will fluctuate each year 
depending on business performance and associated outcomes of incentive plans. The 2020 pay ratios report a wider gap between 
actual earnings of the CEO and UK employees (than compared to the 2019 CEO pay ratios) and this is ultimately due to a higher 
vesting of the 2018 PSP than the increase in the maximum bonus opportunity in the vesting of the 2017 PSP which was included  
in the 2019 CEO pay ratios (57.2% versus 18.0% respectively) and the increase in bonus opportunity in 2020 for the CEO.
The Group is comprised of various different business units and teams with different levels of pay, including call centre staff, support 
staff and engineers. The Committee reviews information about employee pay, reward and progression policies of the Group and, 
(given the relative differences in responsibilities of the roles, the pay relativities between grades within the organisation, and the 
positioning of pay versus the wider market), is comfortable that the median pay ratio is consistent with these policies.
Statement of implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2021
This section sets out the proposed implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2021. No deviations from the procedure 
for the implementation of the policy are proposed.

132 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Annual bonus
The Group Scorecard measures for 2021 have been established for the Group and for each Group business. The 2021 Scorecard  
will include fewer metrics than in the Scorecards of previous years. This will enable the metrics which are included in the 2021 
Scorecard to have a more meaningful weighting, and more impact on the outturn of the 2021 Bonus.
We announced on the 8 February 2021 the proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., which is subject to Drax and 
Pinnacle shareholder approval, and court and regulatory approvals. As this transaction would materially impact all metrics in the 
2021 Scorecard, it is not possible to set the precise targets at this time. The targets will be set as soon as is practicable once there  
is confirmation of whether the acquisition will or will not proceed. As far as possible, details of performance against the metrics  
will be disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report on Remuneration. The following table sets out the categories and a description of  
the measures.
Target
Reason for use
Financial metrics
(60% weighting in the Scorecard)
Group adjusted EBITDA (1)
Adjusted EBITDA is our principal financial metric, combining the underlying performance 
of each business to give a Group outcome.
Leverage (2)
A structural reduction in debt is a key objective for the Group with progress assessed 
against weighted average net debt targets measured within the financial year.
Strategic metrics 
(40% weighting in the Scorecard)
Progress on strategic projects
This element will assess progress against key strategic projects. The choice of projects 
included in this measure will be subject to approval of the Board.
Environmental, employees and sustainability/ 
reputation (2)
Sustainability and Environmental practices are a critical part of our values, vision and 
how Drax will create long-term sustainable returns for shareholders. We have adopted 
an environmental KPI which supports our commitment around tackling climate 
change. This is combined with independent rating of how well we engage and support 
our employees, in addition to an independently determined rating of our reputation in 
sustainable business practices
Notes:
(1) 
The outturn of this KPI is part of the Group’s independent financial audit
(2) The outturn of this KPI is independently reviewed
LTIP
The Committee intends to grant LTIP awards to Executive Directors of 200% of salary for the CEO and 175% of salary for the CFO. 
For the TSR element, performance will be assessed versus the constituents of the FTSE 350 with threshold vesting (25% of 
maximum) for performance in line with the median and maximum vesting for performance in line with upper quartile. 
If the acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. is approved, it is expected to be completed in Q2 or Q3 2021. It is intended that 
the 2021 LTIP grant is made on the normal timetable at the beginning of April 2021, but the targets for the EPS performance 
condition will be set as soon as practicable following either, the completion of the acquisition, or confirmation that the acquisition 
will not proceed. This will allow the EPS target, which is cumulatively measured over the three year performance period, to more 
accurately reflect the impact of the acquisition and to align with shareholder experience over the performance period. Full 
information regarding the targets associated with the performance conditions for the 2021 LTIP grant will be announced via RNS 
no later than three months after the completion of the acquisition.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ fees were reviewed by the Board in February 2021, and it was agreed that they would 
increase by 2% for 2021. The increase of 2% is consistent with the average increase of the wider workforce resulting from the 2021 
pay review. The new annual fee structure will be disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report on Remuneration.

In 2020, the Remuneration Committee was chaired by Nicola Hodson. Other members of the Remuneration Committee during  
the year were John Baxter; Philip Cox; David Nussbaum and Vanessa Simms, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.  
The Group Company Secretary was secretary to the Committee. The CEO was invited to attend meetings of the Committee, except 
when his own remuneration was discussed, as was the Chief Transformation Officer and the Head of Reward.
Adviser to the Committee
The adviser to the Committee for the year was PwC. PwC is an independent adviser appointed by the Committee in October 2010, 
following a competitive tender process, to advise on market practice and remuneration of Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to its Code of Conduct. In addition, the 
Committee has satisfied itself that the advice it receives is objective and independent as PwC has confirmed there are no conflicts 
of interest.
From time to time the Group engages PwC to provide financial, taxation and related advice on specific matters. The Committee  
will continue to monitor such engagements in order to be satisfied that they do not affect PwC’s independence as an adviser to  
the Committee. PwC was paid £101,000, excluding VAT, during 2020 in respect of advice given to the Committee determined on  
a time and material basis.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee.

Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s Ordinary Shares are set out in the Articles, available on the Company’s website at  
www.drax.com/policies. The Articles may only be changed by shareholders by special resolution. The Company is proposing to 
adopt new Articles at the 2021 AGM. Further details of the proposed changes are contained in the Notice of Meeting for the AGM.
Attention should be given to the following sections within the Articles, covering the rights and obligations attaching to shares:
• Variation of rights – which covers the rights attached to any class of shares that may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an extraordinary 
resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares.
• Transfer of shares – provides detail of how transfers of shares in certificated and uncertificated form may be undertaken. It also  
sets out the Directors’ rights of refusal to effect a transfer and the action that Directors must take following such refusal. It should  
be noted that a shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other holders of shares in the Company,  
for a transfer of shares to take place.
• Voting and deadlines for exercising voting rights – these sections of the Articles deal with voting on a show of hands and on a poll. 
They also cover the appointment of a proxy or corporate representative. In respect of voting deadlines, the Articles provide for  
the submission of proxy forms not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting. It has been the 
Company’s practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General Meetings and General Meetings.  
A trustee holds shares on behalf of employees in respect of the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights attached to such 
shares are not directly exercisable by the employees. The employee may direct the trustee on how to vote at a General Meeting  
and the trustee may only cast its vote in respect of shares over which it has received a valid direction from employees.
Disabled employees
The Company gives full consideration to applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with  
the Group continues, and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, so far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.

Political donations
Drax is a politically neutral organisation and did not make any political donations in 2020. The Company regularly engages with 
regulators and policymakers (including those associated with political parties and governments) to listen and contribute to 
discussions on a wide range of matters. Such engagement is an important part of our strategy and contributing to initiatives 
enabling the UK in its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Further information on how we engage with stakeholders can be found 
on pages 40 to 45, and our Political Engagement Policy can be found on the Company’s website at: www.drax.com/about-us/
drax-political-engagement-policy. 
While we do not believe that any expenditure incurred as a result of this engagement would be considered a political donation under 
the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”), due to the broad definition of political donations and as a matter of good governance and 
transparency, we have provided information on areas of expenditure which may be regarded as falling within the scope of the Act. 
During the year ended 31 December 2020, Drax exhibited at, and held events at, conferences organised by political parties, spending 
a total of £11,180 (2019: £41,065). These events allow Drax to present its views on a non-partisan basis to politicians from across the 
political spectrum and non-political stakeholders such as NGOs and other listed and non-listed companies. These payments do not 
indicate support for any political party. The recipients were the Conservative Party (£1,700) and the Labour Party (£9,480). 
At our 2021 AGM, Drax will be seeking renewal from shareholders of the existing authority approved at the 2020 AGM. More details  
are contained in the Notice of Meeting.
Other significant agreements
• A £300 million facility agreement dated 20 December 2012 (as amended and restated on 10 December 2015 and 21 April 2017 and

Agreement”).
• An indenture dated 26 April 2018 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, including by a supplemental indenture dated  
12 February 2019 and a supplemental indenture dated 16 May 2019) between, amongst others, Drax Finco plc and BNY Mellon 
Corporate Trustee Services Limited (as Trustee) governing $500 million 6.625% senior secured notes due November 2025 (the “2018 
Indenture”).
• An indenture dated 4 November 2020 between, amongst others, Drax Finco plc and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited

Indenture, the “Indentures”).
• A £375 million term loan facilities agreement dated 24 July 2019 between, amongst others, Drax Corporate Limited and Banco 
Santander S.A., London Branch (as facility agent) (the “2019 Private Placement”).
• A £98 million and €126.5 million term loan facilities agreement dated 18 August 2020, amongst others, Drax Corporate Limited  
and Banco Santander S.A., London Branch (as facility agent) (the “2020 Private Placement”).
Under the Indentures, a change of control (a “Notes Change of Control”) occurs if any person other than Drax Group plc becomes 
the ultimate beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting rights of Drax Group plc’s direct subsidiary, Drax Group Holdings 
Limited (unless replaced by a successor parent company), or else if all or substantially all of the assets of Drax Group Holdings 
Limited are disposed of outside of the Group. No later than 60 days after any change of control, Drax Group Holdings Limited  
must offer to purchase any outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued  
interest and other unpaid amounts.
Under the Facility Agreement, the Term Facility Agreement, the 2019 Private Placement and the 2019 Private Placement, a change 
of control occurs if any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of Drax Group plc or if Drax Group plc no longer 
holds directly 100% of the issued share capital of Drax Group Holdings Limited (subject to carve-outs for the interposition of an 
intermediate holding company) or else if a Notes Change of Control occurs. Following a change of control, if any lender requires,  
it may by giving notice to the relevant Group entity within 30 days of receiving notice from such Group entity that a change of 
control has occurred, cancel its commitments and require the repayment of its share of any outstanding amounts within three 
business days of such cancellation notice being given.

Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditor
So far as each person serving as a Director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, 
being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors, each Director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to ascertain any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This information is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.
Resolutions will be proposed at the AGM for (i) the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group; and (ii) authorising 
the Directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration. As explained, the Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, 
the auditor’s effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. 
Further details on the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 98 to 107.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC)  
No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law), set out in FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company 
for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole;
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 24 February 2021 and is signed on its behalf by:

In 2020, we developed and 
published two Codes of 
Conduct, one for colleagues 
and one for suppliers. These 
Codes cover a wide range of 
important topics that help 
underpin our culture of acting 
with integrity and doing the 
right thing. They provide 
colleagues, non-permanent 
workers, and suppliers with 
valuable guidance on the 
standards and behaviours 
expected when working at,  
or with, Drax. The colleague 
Code also includes embedded 
videos, which act as a really 
helpful training tool. 
Developing the Codes was a 
fantastic project management 
opportunity and involved 
collaboration with many 
colleagues across the 
business. Deployment has 
been a great success, with lots 
of positive feedback received.”

Independent Auditor’s report 
to the members of Drax Group plc
Report on the audit of the financial statements
1. Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in 
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
• the consolidated cash flow statement;
• the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies on pages 151 to 153;
• the notes 2.1 to 8.3 related to the consolidated financial statements; and
• the notes 1 to 9 related to the parent company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law  
and international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied  
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  
The non-audit services provided to the group for the year are disclosed in note 2.3 to the financial statements. We confirm that  
the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
3. Summary of our audit approach
Key audit 
matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts
• Estimation of Customers unbilled revenue 
• Impairment of OCGT development assets
• Estimation of Opus Energy bad debt provision
Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:
!  Newly identified
 Increased level of risk
 Similar level of risk
 Decreased level of risk
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £12.3m In determining materiality we took into 
consideration a number of metrics, but with particular focus on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation  
and Amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements (Adjusted EBITDA). Our 
selected materiality represents approximately 3% of Adjusted EBITDA (from continuing and discontinued operations) 
for the year.
Scoping
We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at four components, being Drax Generation, Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. These components represent the principal business units and account for 
virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax.
Significant 
changes in  
our approach
Estimation of the Opus Energy bad debt provision has been identified as a key audit matter in the current year. This 
reflects the increase in unpredictability of the collectability of receivables caused by the financial distress created 
by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent with the prior year.

4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting included:
• reviewing the group’s borrowing arrangements including consideration of the new £300m revolving credit facility, which 
matures in 2025;
• assessing the assumptions used in the Group’s Business Plan, including performing sensitivity analysis in relation to assumptions 
for future commodity prices; 
• assessing the impact of Covid-19 on the Group; and
• reviewing the amount of headroom in the forecasts.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
In relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add  
or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered  
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections  
of this report.
5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
5.1. Valuation of commodity, foreign exchange and other contracts
Key audit 
matter 
description
Net losses on derivative contracts recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year, from continuing 
operations, are £70.3m (2019: losses of £119.2m), with related derivative assets of £283.3m and liabilities of £453.6m 
recognised on the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2020. 
The Group has exposure to a number of different financial risks including foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, 
and uses a variety of derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, including commodity contracts, floating swap 
forwards and cross currency swaps. 
The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection of 
appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions, including in respect of future market prices, credit risk 
factors, time value of money and spread adjustments.
Due to the inherent risks as described above, the large volume of data involved in the contract valuations, the 
complex valuation methodologies and models applied, and the requirement for certain manual adjustments, 
typically for credit risk, we have identified a risk of error and a potential fraud risk relating to the possibility for 
management or employees of the company to value trades inappropriately. 
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Audit Committee report on pages 102 to 104. Section 7 sets 
out the financial risk management notes.
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We tested the relevant controls related to the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts. 
With involvement of our internal financial instrument specialists we tested management’s key judgements and 
calculations. This included testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets and checking key contractual 
terms such as volumes and contracted prices.
We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the 
fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a sample of both commodity 
and foreign exchange contracts.
We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking these 
to third party sources. We also reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial 
statements, such as asset impairment, where relevant.
We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments such  
as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments through consideration of third party data.
Key 
observations
From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is reasonable.  
We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward price curve assumptions 
are within acceptable ranges.

5.2. Estimation of Customers unbilled revenue 
Key audit 
matter 
description
The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last meter 
reading and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. Across the Customers division, unbilled revenue at the 
balance sheet date amounted to £204.6m (2019: £207.6m). 
The method of estimating unbilled revenue is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the 
volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value.
We identified a risk of error and a potential fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the Customer businesses, 
in particular to the estimates underpinning unbilled revenue, as these judgemental areas could be manipulated by 
management to misreport revenue.
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Audit Committee report on pages 102 to 104. Accrued 
income is disclosed in note 3.6.
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We tested the relevant controls related to the estimation of certain aspects of unbilled revenue, including controls 
over the reconciliation of meter readings provided by the energy markets, and which are used by management to 
estimate the power supplied. We also tested the controls over the price per unit applied in the valuation of certain 
aspects of unbilled revenue.
When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date, we obtained and evaluated 
management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of revenue supplied and 
completed sample tests to check that the December 2020 unbilled revenue amount was subsequently billed.
We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the volumes recognised 
were appropriate in line with the values accrued.
Key 
observations
Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high level  
of accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue earned in the year to be appropriate.
5.3. Impairment of OCGT development assets 
Key audit 
matter 
description
An asset of £47.0m (2019: £41.9m) is recognised within the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2020 in 
relation to development assets for OCGT projects. Continued development, construction and operation of these 
assets is ultimately dependent upon the ability to secure sufficient future income at an appropriate level in order to 
reduce the project risk and associated returns to an acceptable level.
The business case for these projects is predicated on the ability to secure a Capacity Market contract at an 
appropriate level. Historical Capacity Market clearing prices are noted to be below the levels required for further 
development of these projects and we identified a key audit matter, and a potential fraud risk, in respect of the 
recoverable value of these assets and whether any impairment is required. 
Estimating the recoverable value of these assets requires judgement in relation to key assumptions including 
discount rates, future income levels and capital costs.
Assumptions relating to long term revenues and costs are inherently difficult to assess and the headroom calculated  
is highly sensitive to all these key assumptions.
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Audit Committee report on pages 102 to 104. Intangible 
assets are disclosed in note 5.3.
How the  
scope of  
our audit 
responded  
to the key 
audit matter
We obtained an understanding of relevant controls in relation to management’s impairment assessment process. 
We have reviewed management’s models and challenged the key assumptions including discount rates, income 
assumptions and capital costs. We have benchmarked income assumptions against third party reports prepared  
by reputable market analysts and worked with internal valuation specialists to prepare an independent assessment 
of discount rates. We have challenged management over the appropriateness of capital cost assumptions in light  
of asset specifications and procurement strategies for the project.
We have undertaken analysis and testing including:
• Running a range of sensitivities including alternative scenarios to assess whether an impairment would be 
required if other assumptions were adopted; 
• Verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models; and 
• Assessing whether the disclosures in note 5.3 of the financial statements appropriately disclose the key 
judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact in the financial statements of 
changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment.
Key 
observations
We believe that the assumptions used by management are appropriate and supported by third party independent 
assessments.
Discount rates applied by management (7.0%) are considered to be at the lowest end (that is, optimistic end) of  
the range expected for projects of this nature. Based on alternative scenarios we are satisfied that no impairment  
is required.

5.4. Estimation of Opus Energy bad debt provision 
!
Key audit 
matter 
description
The financial distress created by the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the rate of defaults across several industries 
and a rise in the amount of bad debts. Management needs to exercise significant judgement over the level of bad 
debt provision required on their receivables at reporting dates which is increasingly difficult due to unpredictability 
of when the economic environment will improve. 
We identified a risk of error and a potential fraud risk in relation to the estimation of bad debt provision for the 
customers of Opus Energy given their customers are largely small and medium enterprises (“SME”), including some  
in the retail, entertainment and hospitality industries. and the range of judgement that could apply is far greater 
than associated with Haven Power’s larger industrial customers. 
The bad debt provision associated with Opus Energy at the balance sheet date amounted to £51.4m (2019: £37.8m). 
To calculate the provision, management use a bad debt model, which includes assumptions for the impact of 
Covid-19 and lifetime expected credit outcomes for receivables. 
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions set out on page 152 and the Audit Committee report on pages 102 to 104. The bad debt provision  
is disclosed in note 3.6.
How the  
scope of  
our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We obtained an understanding of relevant controls related to the estimation of the bad debt provision. 
With involvement of our specialist modelling team, we performed a review of the bad debt model. We tested the 
completeness and accuracy of the data used in the model.
We challenged management’s assumptions, including for the impact for Covid-19, and challenged whether they 
reflect the lifetime expected credit outcomes for receivables. This work included analysis of cash payment trends 
and cancellation of direct debits. We benchmarked the recorded provision against alternative valuation models, 
including cash collection rates and external valuations.
Key 
observations
Based on the work performed we concluded that the bad debt provision has been appropriately stated.
6. Our application of materiality
6.1. Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope  
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements
Materiality
£12.3m (2019: £12.2m)
£6.0m (2019: £5.6m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
In determining materiality we considered by 
considering a range of possible benchmarks but  
with a particular focus on Adjusted EBITDA, which 
excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements. We also considered together with 
profit before and after interest and tax as well as  
the scale of the balance sheet and the overall size  
of the business. 
Our selected materiality represents approximately  
3.0% of Adjusted EBITDA (continuing and discontinued 
operations) for the year (2019: 3.0%) the basis of which 
is consistent with the prior year.
Component materiality for the parent company has 
primarily been determined on the basis of the net assets 
and capped at 49% (2019: 46%) of the materiality 
identified for the Group. This is a judgement and reflects 
the significant value of investments held on the balance 
sheet at the year end (£724.9m). Parent company 
materiality equates to 0.8% of net assets (2019: 0.8%).

Financial statements
Shareholder information
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements
Rationale  
for the 
benchmark 
applied
We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is of particular 
relevance to users of the financial statements and  
is a key measure of performance used by the Group.  
It excludes volatility caused in particular by the 
remeasurements of derivative contracts and 
exceptional items, defined as those transactions that, 
by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance 
of the Group in the period.
Although the sale of the non-core gas portfolio has 
triggered the disclosure of discontinued operations,  
we consider it appropriate to use both continuing and 
discontinued operations in the calculation of Adjusted 
EBITDA as the discontinued operations contributed a 
full year of results to the Group.
When determining materiality, we considered the  
net assets of the company as its principal activity is  
as an investment holding company for the Group.

Audit Committee 
reporting threshold £0.6m
6.2. Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements

70% (2019: 70%) of group materiality
70% (2019: 70%) of parent company materiality 
Basis and 
rationale for 
determining 
performance 
materiality
In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:
• The low level of historical uncorrected misstatements within the consolidated financial statements;
• Our assessment of the control environment and conclusions from our testing of group wide controls; and
• The lack of significant changes in the business in the year which would impact on our ability to forecast 
expected level of misstatement.
6.3 Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.6m (2019: £0.6m), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1. Identification and scoping of components
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 
four components, being Drax Generation, Haven Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. These represent the principal business 
units of the Group and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. This is in line with our audit 
approach from the prior year. 
All work was performed by the UK audit team under the supervision of the Senior Statutory Auditor. 
A full scope audit was performed for all significant components. This scope was selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at all significant component 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and 
ranged from £4.3m to £6.1m (2019: £4.0m to £6.0m).
At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components  
not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
During 2019 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited the primary locations for all four significant components. In the current year,  
this has not been possible due to the Covid-19 restrictions, and we have audited all locations working remotely. 
7.2. Our consideration of the control environment
We involved our IT specialists to assess relevant controls over the group’s IT systems. Working with IT specialists we identified  
and assessed relevant risks of material misstatement arising from each relevant IT system and the supporting infrastructure 
technologies based on the role of application in the Group’s flow of transactions. We obtained an understanding of the  
IT environment as part of these risk assessment procedures. Relevant controls were identified and tested to address those  
IT risks over the following systems:
• Oracle
• Aligne 
• ERS Billing system at Haven Power
8. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion  
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives 
rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so.
10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which 
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 
11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with 
laws and regulations, we considered the following:
• the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group’s 
remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;
• the group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error;
• results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment  
of the risks of irregularities; 
• any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:
 
– identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;
 
– detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
 
– the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
• the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists, including tax, pensions, IT, valuation 
and financial instrument specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential 
indicators of fraud.
As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud 
and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: valuation of commodity, foreign exchange and other 
contracts, estimation of Customers unbilled revenue, impairment of OCGT development assets, estimation of Opus Energy bad 
debt provision, cut-off of bilateral sales and working capital transactions. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also 
required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.
We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of 
those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions 
legislation, Tax legislation, and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the Group operates, including the 
Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have 
a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to 
avoid a material penalty.
11.2. Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified estimation of valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts, 
estimation of Customers unbilled revenue, impairment of OCGT development assets and estimation of Opus Energy bad debt 
provision as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters 
in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. 
 In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
• reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions  
of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
• enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
• performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud;
• reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence 
with HMRC; 
• in addressing the risk of fraud in cut-off of bilateral sales, in addition to our testing described above we have performed focussed 
testing on trades close to the year end combined with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy and completeness of 
revenue recognised; and
• in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other 
adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and 
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.  
In addition, we have challenged management on the rationale for the use of working capital transactions, entered into. We also 
reviewed the accounting treatments adopted by management against the specific contractual terms and arrangements 
associated with each working capital transaction and reviewed the related disclosures in the financial statements;
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members 
including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations 
throughout the audit.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
13. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of  
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: 
• the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 
uncertainties identified set out on pages 27, 64 and 65;
• the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 
appropriate set out on pages 27, 64 and 65;
• the directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 138;
• the board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 66 to 77;
• the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set 
out on page 66 and 67; and
• the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 98 to 107.
14. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
14.1 Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
14.2. Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
15. Other matters which we are required to address
15.1. Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 
22 April 2020 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2020 and subsequent financial periods. The period 
of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 16 years, covering the years 
ending 31 December 2005 to 2020.
15.2. Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with 
ISAs (UK).
16. Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to

Shareholder information
Financial statements
Introduction
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed 
information about the financial performance (Consolidated 
income statement and Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income), financial position (Consolidated 
balance sheet), reserves (Consolidated statement of changes  
in equity), and cash flows (Consolidated cash flow statement)  
of Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities 
controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group).
The notes to the financial statements provide additional 
information on the items in the Consolidated income statement, 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated 
balance sheet, Consolidated statement of changes in equity 
and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes include 
explanations of the information presented. In general, the 
additional information in the notes to the financial statements 
is required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding 
of the primary statements set out on pages 154-158, as well as 
voluntary information which management believe users of the 
accounts may find useful, in line with the spirit of IFRS.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with international accounting standards in conformity with  
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation 
(EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that are 
measured at fair value (principally derivative financial 
instruments) and the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
defined benefit pension schemes (measured at fair value  
and using the projected unit credit method respectively).
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling  
at the average monthly exchange rate to the extent that this 
approximates the exchange rate prevailing at the date of  
the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets 
and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary 
items are not retranslated.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such 
retranslations are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement within foreign exchange gains/(losses).
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using 
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income  
and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling 
using the average monthly exchange rate to the extent this 
approximates the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the retranslation of the operation’s net assets, and its results  
for the year, are recognised in the Consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments 
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash 
flows, are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 77 
of this Annual Report. In particular, Brexit and Covid-19 are 
considered in the Financial Review on page 27.
In the viability statement on pages 64 to 65 the directors state 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will  
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as  
they fall due over the next three years.
Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months 
and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled  
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each 
year. At 31 December 2020, the Company owned 100% of the 
equity of all subsidiaries. 
Accounting policies
The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an 
individual item in the financial statements are described in the 
note to the financial statements relating to the item concerned 
(see contents on page 142).
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, 
except for the adoption of new standards effective as of 
1 January 2020. The Group has not early-adopted any standard, 
interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not  
yet effective.
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and 
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial 
statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of these 
new requirements has not had a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires judgement  
to be applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also 
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may subsequently differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements which have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements, 
and the key estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are set  
out below. Further detail, including sensitivity analysis where 
appropriate for the key estimates and assumptions, is included 
in the related notes.
152 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Critical accounting judgements
The critical judgements made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements are set out below.
Certain remeasurements and exceptional items – Each year 
management confirms the judgements made regarding 
transactions to exclude from the Adjusted Results of the Group, 
as described under Alternative performance measures, below. 
The judgement as to whether a transaction or group of 
transactions should or should not be classified as a certain 
remeasurement or an exceptional item can have a significant 
impact on the Adjusted Results of the Group. An internal policy 
governs the judgements made by management and in all 
instances, these judgements are approved by the Audit 
Committee. 
See note 2.7 on page 170
Closure of coal generation at Drax Power Station – On 
26 February 2020, following a comprehensive review, the Board 
determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power 
Station in March 2021, with the two coal units remaining 
available to meet Capacity Market obligations until September 
2022. As a result of this closure decision, which reflected that 
the dependencies between the coal and biomass generating 
units are no longer considered to be significant, the Group  
has determined the Drax Power Station site to be comprised  
of two distinct cash-generating units (CGUs), one comprised  
of biomass generation assets and one comprised of coal 
generation assets. Previously, the Drax Power Station site was 
considered to be a single CGU. These Financial statements have 
been prepared on the basis that this change occurred on the 
date of the closure decision – 26 February 2020.
Following the closure decision, an impairment review was 
undertaken for the CGU containing the coal generation assets. 
This review indicated that the recoverable amount of the coal 
assets, calculated with reference to a value in use calculation 
based on the Group’s latest approved forecasts, was 
significantly lower than their carrying value. As described  
in note 5.1, an asset obsolescence charge of £225.9 million  
has been recognised in the Consolidated income statement  
in respect of the coal generation assets CGU. There were no 
reasonably possible changes in the assumptions underlying the 
value in use calculation that would have resulted in a material 
change to the value of the asset obsolescence charge. This view 
has not subsequently changed. The asset obsolescence charge 
has been treated as an exceptional item and excluded from the 
Group’s Adjusted Results.
See note 2.7 on page 170 and note 5.1 on page 190
Accounting for biomass purchase and sale contracts – The 
Group buys and sells biomass from time to time. To date, these 
contracts have been entirely for operational purposes. During 
the first half of 2020, the Group approved a change in risk 
management policies to permit some flexibility in trading 
activity to optimise the overall portfolio position and potentially 
release value in certain, limited circumstances. Following this 
change, the Group undertook an assessment of whether 
contracts to buy and sell biomass are within the scope of 
IFRS 9. Previously, the own-use exemption was applied to these 
contracts, resulting in no amounts being recognised in respect 
of these contracts until they matured. If the contracts were 
deemed to be within the scope of IFRS 9, and the own-use 
exemption could not be applied, this would result in these 
contracts being required to be recognised at fair value as 
derivative assets/liabilities from inception.
This assessment concluded that, whilst the own-use exemption 
was likely to no longer apply to all biomass purchase and sale 
contracts, if and when sales contracts are executed for 
optimisation purposes, the nature of these contracts means 
they cannot be readily net settled in cash or other financial 
instruments and, as a result, they remain outside of the scope  
of IFRS 9. Accordingly, the accounting for these contracts has 
not changed from prior periods in these financial statements 
and therefore the contracts are not recognised until delivery.
Property, plant and equipment – The weighted average 
remaining useful economic life for assets at Drax Power Station 
is 17 years. This is shorter than the 19 years to the current 
estimate of end of station life in 2039 but extends beyond the 
end date of current subsidies for biomass generation, which is in 
2027. The Group does not consider the end of subsidies in 2027 
to be an indicator of impairment for these assets, reflecting our 
expectations for biomass generation beyond this date. 
See note 3.1 on page 173
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key sources of estimation uncertainty that 
carry the most significant risk of a material effect on next year’s 
Financial statements – that is, the items where actual outcomes 
in the next 12 months could vary significantly from the estimates 
made in determining the reported amount of an asset or liability.
Measurement of expected credit loss provisions – As a result  
of Covid-19, the Group has significantly increased its expectation 
of potential customer business failure rates and the resulting 
expected credit losses within the Customers business unit.  
The Group has updated its provisioning methodology, using 
data for collection performance since the implementation  
of lockdown measures in the UK during March 2020 and 
expectations regarding future default rates, to take account  
of this increased risk. The increase in the charge for impairment 
losses of trade receivables from £18.0 million in the year  
ended 31 December 2019 to £43.1 million in the year ended  
31 December 2020 is driven by the anticipated impacts of 
Covid-19 on levels of bad debt, resulting in a closing provision, 
after adjusting for actual credit losses, of £56.4 million (as at  
31 December 2019: £40.7 million).
Whilst the position adopted reflects the Group’s current best 
estimate of possible outcomes, actual rates of bad debt will 
depend upon the severity and depth of Covid-19, the measures 
applied during 2021 and beyond, and actual cash collection 
rates. Accordingly, actual outturn may differ from the position 
adopted by the Group in these Financial statements.
See note 3.6 on page 179
Property, plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic 
life. Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past 
experience, anticipated future replacement cycles and other 
available evidence. Useful economic lives are reviewed at least 
annually. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment at 
31 December 2020 is £1,941.1 million and depreciation on these 
assets in the year, based on the useful economic lives disclosed 
in note 3.1, was £125.8 million. If the useful economic lives were  
to increase or decrease by three years, the impact on the 
depreciation charge for the year would be approximately  
£22.4 million.

Shareholder information
Impairment – An impairment review is conducted annually of 
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life and as 
required for other assets and CGUs where an indicator of possible 
impairment exists. In 2020, an impairment assessment has been 
completed for five of the Group’s CGUs which have allocated 
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life. The 
assessment of future cash flows that underpins such a review is 
based on management’s best estimate of a number of variables 
including retail margins, future commodity prices, supply 
volumes, capacity market clearing prices and macro-economic 
conditions. Certain CGUs have reasonably possible changes in 
assumptions which, if they were to change over the next twelve 
months, could lead to a material reduction in headroom, or a 
small impairment and are therefore additionally disclosed as a 
source of estimation uncertainty in respect of the disclosures 
provided. Further detail is contained within the references below.
See note 5.2 on page 190 and note 5.3 on page 192
Pension liabilities – The Group records a net surplus or liability  
in its balance sheet for its obligation to provide benefits under 
approved defined benefit pension schemes, less the fair value  
of assets held by the pension schemes. The actuarial valuations 
of the schemes’ liabilities are performed annually by an 
independent qualified actuary and depend on assumptions 
regarding interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension 
increases, mortality and other factors, any of which are subject to 
future change. Two of the key estimates within the valuation are 
the discount and inflation rates. The value of the pension surplus 
recognised by the Group at 31 December 2020 in relation to the 
Drax ESPS scheme is £9.5 million and the value of the pension 
obligation recognised in relation to the Drax 2019 scheme is £1.3 
million. Sensitivities in the valuations are discussed in note 6.3.
See note 6.3 on page 201
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
The measures described below are used throughout the Annual 
report and accounts, and are measures that are not defined 
within IFRS but provide additional information about financial 
performance and position that is used by the Board to evaluate 
the Group’s trading performance. These measures have been 
defined internally and may therefore not be comparable to 
similar APMs presented by other companies.
Adjusted Results
The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured  
in accordance with IFRS, is shown in the Total Results column 
on the face of the Consolidated income statement. Exceptional 
items and certain remeasurements are deducted from the  
Total Results in arriving at the Adjusted Results for the year.  
The Group’s Adjusted Results are consistent with the way 
executive management and the Board assess the performance 
of the Group. Adjusted Results are intended to reflect the 
underlying trading performance of the Group’s businesses  
and are presented to assist users of the financial statements  
in evaluating the Group’s trading performance and performance 
against strategic objectives.
The Group presents an additional subtotal in the Adjusted 
Results column. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of 
exceptional items and certain remeasurements. Adjusted 
EBITDA is the primary measure used by executive management 
and the Board to assess the financial performance of the Group 
as it provides a more comparable assessment of the Group’s 
year-on-year trading performance. 
Exceptional items and certain remeasurements
Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, 
do not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. 
For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management 
considers the nature of the transaction, the frequency of  
similar events, previous precedent and commercial context. 
Exceptional items are approved by the Audit Committee in  
line with an approved policy.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses  
on derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts 
do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is  
not effective which, under IFRS, are recorded in revenue, cost of 
sales or foreign exchange gains/(losses) as described above. The 
Group regards all of its forward contracting activity to represent 
an economic hedge. The impact of excluding these fair value 
remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and purchases  
at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect of 
delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the 
impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency 
purchases), in the Adjusted Results. The result of this adjustment 
shows the impact in revenue, cost of sales and foreign exchange 
gains/(losses) at the time the transaction takes place.
See note 2.7 on page 170
Net debt
The Group defines net debt as total borrowings less cash and 
cash equivalents. Total borrowings includes external financial 
debt, such as loan notes, term loans and amounts drawn in  
cash under revolving credit facilities (see note 4.3) but excludes 
other financial liabilities such as lease liabilities calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 16 (see note 3.2), pension obligations  
and trade and other payables. Some of this debt is denominated 
in foreign currencies and the Group has entered into hedging 
arrangements associated with this currency exposure.
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This 
reflects the nature of the contracts included in this balance 
which, prior to the application of IFRS 16, were predominantly 
not held on the balance sheet and instead were disclosed as 
operating commitments. This is consistent with the Group’s 
covenant reporting requirements.
The Group also discloses net debt after the impact of relevant 
currency hedging derivatives. This adjusts the borrowings 
figure included in the net debt calculation to take into account 
the effect of financial instruments entered into to hedge 
movements in, for example, foreign exchange rates in relation  
to debt principal repayments. The Directors believe that this 
measure provides useful information about the economic 
substance of the Group’s net debt position.
Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio
The ratio of net debt (as defined above) to Adjusted EBITDA 
from continuing and discontinued operations, expressed  
as a multiple. The Group has a long-term target for net debt  
to Adjusted EBITDA of around 2.0x.
From time to time, the Group discloses a “proforma” ratio,  
which includes adjustments to reflect the cash flow timing 
impact of significant one-off or other events outside of the 
Group’s control that, in the view of the directors, would 
otherwise distort performance in the period. Where applicable, 
such adjustments are described and a rationale for the 
adjustment provided.

Non-cash transactions recognised in the income statement are reconciled to operating cash flow as part of the disclosure provided 
in note 4.4. Significant non-cash transactions in 2020 included asset obsolescence charges of £239.3 million (see note 2.7). There 
were no material non-cash transactions in the previous year.
The Group recorded a net loss of £275.5 million (2019: net loss £117.6 million) arising on exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements in the Consolidated income statement in 2020. Acquisition and restructuring costs of £1.0 million 
(2019: £9.0 million) are included in cash generated from operations (see note 4.4) and cash paid in respect of debt restructuring 
of £3.8 million in net cash from operating activities (2019: £5.2 million in cash used in financing activities). All other exceptional 
items and remeasurements are non-cash and adjusted in the reconciliation shown in note 4.4.

Section 2: Financial performance
The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes 
a summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (see note 2.1), analysis of certain income statement items 
(notes 2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, dividends and distributable profits (notes 2.7–2.10). 
Further commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in 
Adjusted EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 77, with particular reference to key transactions and market 
conditions that have affected the results.
2.1 Segmental reporting
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central corporate office 
providing certain specialist and shared functions. The Group’s businesses, which each represent a reportable operating segment 
for the purpose of segmental reporting, are:
• Generation: power generation activities in the UK;
• Customers: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK; and
• Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US.
Information reported to the Board, who are considered the Chief Operating Decision Maker, for the purposes of assessing 
performance and making investment decisions is based on these three segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable 
segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined on page 153).
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate 
office costs are included within central costs.
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reportable operating segment for the year ended 31 December 2020. 
The Board monitors the Adjusted Results for the Group by reportable operating segment as presented in the tables below. The 
financial information in these tables is comprised solely of results from continuing operations. The net result from discontinued 
operations of £36.7 million (2019: £10.2 million) is attributable entirely to the Generation segment and is described in further detail 
in note 5.5:

2019 figures have been re-presented for the impact of discontinued operations accounting in relation to the sale of the CCGT 
assets. See note 5.5. 
The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same 
as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results 
of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to 
summer months.
Capital expenditure by segment
Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year for continuing and discontinued operations were £174.4 million (1) 
(2019: £171.4 million). See the Group Financial Review on page 20 for further details about the key capital investments in the year. 
Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, 
equate to market prices. During 2020, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £231.0 million  
(2019: £229.4 million) to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value  
of £1,530.1 million (2019: £1,512.7 million) to the Customers segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation.
Major customers
Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 includes £495.2 million from one individual customer (2019: 
£575.7 million from one individual customer) that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year. These revenues arose  
in the Generation segment.
Note:
(1) 
 The difference between the cost capitalised and the cash flow in 2020 is predominantly a result of the recognition of the asset associated with the increase in the 
decommissioning provision in the year, a non-cash adjustment of £28.9 million.

2.2 Revenue
Accounting policy
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies. Revenue is presented gross  
in the income statement as the Group controls the specified good or service prior to the transfer to the customer.
Revenues from the sale of electricity by the Group’s Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered  
at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable. The performance obligations for these contracts 
are deemed to be a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and transfer consecutively. Control is deemed to have 
passed to the customer at the point that the electricity has been supplied. The performance obligation is satisfied over time based 
on the output method; this method recognises revenue based on the value transferred to the customer. This is measured based  
on energy supplied to the customer with the amount billed based on the units of electricity supplied.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the Contract for Difference (CfD) (see below) in the income statement  
as a component of revenue at the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract. This is considered  
to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system support services) are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the 
delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by 
reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require 
judgement in estimating probable future outcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum)  
are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the 
customer’s premises.
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the Customers business is recognised on  
the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can  
be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption  
and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is estimated based  
on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income.
Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The revenue recognised  
per unit of energy supplied is based on the total estimated revenue and cost inputs for fixed price Customers contracts, and 
contracted prices for variable price contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but third-party costs can be variable,  
therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
The Group is eligible for, and applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information related to  
the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. The right to receive consideration from a customer is at  
an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date.
CfD payments
The Group is party to a CfD with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering 
elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in 
respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated by reference to a strike 
price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK Consumer Price 
Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2020 was £116.49 per MWh.
When market prices (based on average traded prices in the preceding season) are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/
receives an additional payment to/from LCCC equivalent to the difference between that market power price and the strike price, 
for each MWh produced from the generating unit supported by the CfD. Such payments are in addition to amounts received from 
the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the 
relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.

2.2 Revenue continued
ROC sales
The generation and sale of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance.  
The Renewable Obligation (RO) scheme places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their 
electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO scheme, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity 
which are then sold bilaterally to counterparties, including suppliers, to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations  
under the RO scheme. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually. CP1 commenced  
in April 2002. At 31 December 2020 the Group is operating in CP19.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set 
at £30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with the UK Retail Price Index. The buy-out price in CP19 is £50.05. ROCs are typically procured in 
arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end 
of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata 
basis to suppliers who presented ROCs in a compliance period.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the 
expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier relating to the buy-out price and the expected value 
of the recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of 
ROCs to help optimise its working capital position. External sales of ROCs in the table below includes £495.2 million of such sales 
(2019: £575.7 million), with a similar value reflected in cost of sales. See note 3.4 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by 
the Generation businesses and those utilised by the Customers business in the year.
Biomass pellet sales
The Group produces biomass pellets. The performance obligation is the delivery of the pellets to the customer. Delivery of the 
pellets is deemed to be when the customer obtains control of the pellets which is dependent on the individual shipping terms  
of the contract, but is generally when the product is loaded onto the shipping vessel. The amount of revenue recognised is based 
on the contract price for the pellets.

presented within cost of sales. 
 
When defining gross profit within the financial statements, the Group follows the principal trading considerations applied by  
its Generation and Customers businesses when making a sale. In respect of Generation, this reflects the direct costs of the 
commodities to generate the power (such as biomass, gas, coal, and carbon, or balancing power purchased) and the relevant grid 
connection costs that arise. In respect of Customers, this reflects the direct costs of supply being the costs of the power or gas 
supplied, together with costs levied on suppliers such as network costs, broker costs and renewables incentive mechanisms. 
Accordingly cost of sales excludes depreciation, presented separately on the face of the income statement, and staff costs to the 
extent included in operating and administrative expenses and set out in the table above.

2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there 
is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment at 
least annually.
In respect of the Customers and Pellet Production businesses, the Group considers the smallest groups of assets that generate 
independent cash flows to be equivalent to the operating entities within those businesses – Haven Power, Opus Energy and 
Drax Biomass.
In respect of the Generation business, the Group generally considers the smallest groups of assets that generate independent cash 
flows to be the individual sites that share common infrastructure and control functions. As described on page 190, following the 
decision to cease commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station, a review of CGUs at that site determined the site to be 
comprised of two separate CGUs (one for biomass generation assets and one for coal generation assets). Previously, Drax Power 
Station was considered a single CGU. As described in further detail below and in note 5.1, following this change the coal CGU was 
subsequently fully written down in the period. Accordingly, excluding the fully written down coal CGU, the Generation business is 
comprised of (eight CGUs in total) – Drax Power Station (biomass), Damhead Creek, Rye House, Shoreham, Blackburn, Lanark, 
Galloway and Cruachan. In addition, the Group considers impairment for the OCGTs as a whole, as these intangible assets have an 
indefinite useful life.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference 
to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or 
the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial 
assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.

2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment continued
The assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of the necessary  
costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, including  
an allocation of centrally managed costs. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from the  
Group’s cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those 
cash flow hedges. Assessments of future cash flows consider relevant environmental and climate factors. In particular, macro-
economic, commodity price and third-party cost assumptions reflect considerations in respect of growth in renewable 
technologies, electrification and the impact of relevant policies on longer-term supply and demand profiles.
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any 
future restructuring or reorganisation that the Group is not yet committed to. In determining value in use, the estimate of future 
cash flows is discounted to present value using a rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the 
carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Goodwill balances and intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2 
and 5.3).
Assessment of indicators of impairment
In February 2020, the Board determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in March 2021, with the two coal 
units remaining available to meet Capacity Market obligations until September 2022. As a result of this closure decision, which 
reflected that the dependencies between the coal and biomass generating units are no longer considered to be significant, the 
Group determined the coal generation assets at Drax Power Station were now a separate CGU. An impairment review was 
subsequently performed on the coal CGU which resulted in an asset obsolescence charge of £225.9 million, the total net book 
value of the assets concerned, being recognised due to the recoverable amount of the CGU being significantly lower than its 
carrying amount. Following this charge, the assets in the coal CGU have been fully written down. See note 5.1 for further details.
During the year, the Board also made the decision not to pursue the option to develop a new CCGT at Drax Power Station. This  
led to the assets associated with this project becoming obsolete, and therefore an asset obsolescence charge of £13.4 million has  
been recognised due to the carrying value of these assets being significantly higher than their recoverable amount of £nil, which 
led to the assets being fully written off. In addition to the £13.4 million obsolescence charge, £1.1 million of associated costs are 
included within the £30.0 million exceptional operating expenses. See note 2.7.  
 
A review of the Group’s remaining CGUs gave rise to an indicator of impairment for the two CGUs which comprise the Customers 
business unit, as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on their financial performance during 2020. As goodwill is attributed  
to both of these CGUs, an impairment review is performed annually, see note 5.2.
In determining that no indicator of impairment existed in respect of the remaining CGUs, the Group considered changes in market 
prices for commodities, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in macro-economic conditions, potential impacts of climate 
change and regulatory requirements since the previous balance sheet date, and the impact of such changes on the Group’s 
long-term planning models and future forecast cash flows. Particular consideration was given to assumptions regarding biomass 
generation and biomass prices post-2027, when current subsidies for biomass generation are due to expire. Our forecasts indicate 
that the majority of the carrying amount of the CGU is supported by pre-2027 cash flows. Whilst the Group has a strategic 
imperative to reduce biomass prices over time, as part of a strategy to secure a long-term future for biomass generation, the 
long-term models that inform impairment conclusions are subjected to an additional sensitivity to identify the risk that biomass 
prices do not reduce significantly in the period up to and following the cessation of subsidies. Further consideration of biomass 
prices is included in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 77. Drax Power Station is viewed as having a useful life until 2039 at least and 
an expectation of continuing to be in operation until that time. 
Impairment considerations for CGUs where goodwill has previously been allocated are set out in note 5.2.
Separate consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3.
Apart from the coal generation CGU and Drax Power Station CCGT specific assets, all impairment reviews conducted in  
2020 indicated adequate headroom to conclude that no impairment charges were required. Accordingly, apart from the asset 
obsolescence charges recognised in relation to the coal generation assets and Drax Power Station CCGT (see note 5.1), no other 
amounts have been charged to the income statement in respect of asset impairment in 2020 (2019: No asset obsolescence 
charge). Sensitivity analyses are disclosed in respect of the Opus, Lanark and Galloway CGUs and indefinite life OCGT assets  
in notes 5.2 and 5.3 respectively. Further sensitivities are not provided on other assets because there are no reasonably possible 
sensitivities which would lead to an impairment.

2.5 Net finance costs
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing the debt structure (such as interest payable on bonds) as well as foreign 
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounts on provisions for reinstatement of the Group’s sites at the end of their 
useful lives (see note 5.4), net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligations (see note 6.3) and lease 
liabilities (see note 3.2). These are offset by interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash 
surpluses, for example through investment in money market funds.
Refinancing activity in 2020
Changes in the Group’s financing structure during 2020 are described in note 4.3.
As described in note 2.7, £8.6 million (2019: £5.2 million) of costs associated with the restructuring of the Group’s financing 
structure during the year have been excluded from Adjusted Results and are presented as an exceptional item.

Foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances denominated in 
foreign currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date.
2.6 Current and deferred taxation
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable 
profits (which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not 
allowable for tax purposes) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects 
where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules. This is reflected 
in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used  
in the computation of taxable profits. The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax on the loss before tax for the Group for  
the year ended 31 December 2020 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised 
in the income statement.
Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant 
jurisdiction. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement, because it excludes  
items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability 
(or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity respectively.
The Group has utilised the relief available under the research and development expenditure credit regime (RDEC). Under this 
regime, research and development tax credits are accounted for as development grants, in line with IAS 20 Government Grants and 
are recorded in operating profit within the income statement, with the corresponding receivable being offset against corporation 
tax payable.
In accounting for taxation, the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax 
purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable, based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. 
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been 
substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence 
other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19% (2019: 19%) of the assessable profit or loss for the 
year. Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Certain deferred tax liabilities were valued at 17% in the prior period, being the UK corporation tax rate that had been substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. On 17 March 2020 the UK Government substantively enacted a main UK corporation tax rate of 
19%, giving rise to a charge of £18.1 million (2019: £1.7 million) due to the effect of changes in the tax rate.

As a result of tax relief arising from the UK Patent Box regime (see below), partially offset by US federal tax rates of 21%, in the 
medium term the Group anticipates that the underlying effective tax rate will be marginally lower than the main rate  
of corporation tax in the UK.
Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed 
to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company is entitled to 
apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise they are shown 
separately in the balance sheet.
Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £33.5 million (2019: £27.8 million) in relation to start-up losses 
and other temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing 
improvement in operational performance, the Group anticipates that it will generate sufficient profits in the medium term against 
which to utilise this asset.

2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional items
The Group presents Adjusted Results in the Consolidated income statement. The Directors believe that this approach is useful and 
provides a clear and consistent view of trading performance. Certain remeasurements and exceptional items are excluded from 
Adjusted Results and presented in a separate column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about 
the financial performance of the business and is consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the 
performance of the business.
The Group has a policy and framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional 
are also all approved by the Audit Committee. See the Audit Committee Report on page 98 for further details.
In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately:
• Asset obsolescence charges, which related to coal-specific assets associated with the decision to cease commercial coal generation 
in 2021 and the decision not to pursue the option of creating a CCGT at Drax Power Station. (2020)
• Operating expenditure which was incurred as a direct result of the decision to cease commercial coal generation. (2020)
• Restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (formerly 
ScottishPower Generation Limited) into the Group. (2019)
• Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Group’s debt in 2020 and 2019, including facility break costs and the acceleration  
of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities. Interest costs in 2019 that related to the 
acquisition bridge facility were classified as exceptional, as they relate directly to the acquisition described above.
• Costs and credits arising as a result of major transactions, namely deal costs and costs to close out outstanding trades on the disposal 
of the CCGTs, more detail can be found in note 5.5, and proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc.
• Certain remeasurements constitute gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for 
hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to the delivery  
of commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the current period.  
Once the gains or losses are realised, the previously recognised fair value movements are then reversed through remeasurements  
and recognised within Adjusted Results either as revenue or cost of sales. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the 
Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received  
in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, to better reflect the trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

2.8 Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share in issue. Basic 
EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that would 
vest on their future maturity dates if the conditions at the end of the reporting period were the same as those at the end of the 
contingency period (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2) were exercised and treated as 
ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve 
payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2020 of 10.3 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £41 million) 
payable on or before 14 May 2021. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2020. This would bring 
total dividends payable in respect of the 2020 financial year to £68 million.
The Group has a long-standing capital allocation policy. This policy is based on a commitment to robust financial metrics that 
underpin the Group’s strong credit rating, investment in the core business, paying a sustainable and growing dividend, and 
returning surplus capital to shareholders. The Board is confident that the dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow as the 
implementation of the Group’s strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In determining the 
rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from 
the Group’s commodity-linked revenue streams.
In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most 
appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders. 
 
Consideration of sustainability, including a link to our dividend, can be found in the Market context section on pages 2 and 3.
2.10 Retained profits
Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over

Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits 
and cash resources.
The Parent Company financial statements set out on pages 228 to 234 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s 
distributable reserves of £191.5 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions  
in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors 
the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend 
payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves.
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £289.8 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation 
within note 4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury 
management purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group.
The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any  
given year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the 
foreseeable future.

Section 3: Operating assets and working capital
This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets  
and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.
3.1 Property, plant and equipment
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by the Group that are used in the 
businesses to generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what was paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects  
the usage of the asset over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement 
evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment,  
if required) charged to date.
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment assets are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade 
discounts and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling  
and removing the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  
and any provision for impairment in value.
The Group constructs many of its assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction 
are not depreciated until they are ready for use in the way intended.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful 
economic lives (UEL) of the assets from the date that they are brought into use (where relevant, limited to the expected 
decommissioning date of the site where the asset is located).
In accordance with IFRS 5, the depreciation on the Gas-fired assets ceased in December 2020, the point at which the assets were 
classified as, and transferred to, assets held for sale (note 5.5).
The table below shows the weighted average remaining useful economic lives of the main categories of assets held at the balance 
sheet date:

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. The value of freehold land held  
at 31 December 2020 is £10.5 million. 
The Group’s total commitment for future capital expenditure is disclosed in note 7.7.
An impairment charge is recognised immediately if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The Group’s 
policy is to recognise an impairment charge through accumulated depreciation and impairment if the asset will continue to be 
used by the Group or if the asset will be subsequently sold. Assets that will no longer be used by the Group are disposed of by 
removing both the cost and any accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common 
to the whole plant and are shown separately. Common plant that will continue to be used for biomass generation post coal closure 
will continue to be recognised. Any common plant that will no longer be used post coal closure has been considered and impaired 
as necessary as part of the asset obsolescence charge recognised relating to the coal closure (see note 5.1).
Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production segment and the assets at the Daldowie  
Fuel Plant near Glasgow.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the relevant power station or plant.

Section 3: Operating assets and working capital continued
3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power stations are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and 
technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. Any changes are applied prospectively.
Significant estimation uncertainty
Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date taking into consideration the impact of climate and environmental 
change. see note 2.4 for further details. 
In February 2020, the Government announced its intention to bring forward the closure date for coal by one year to October 2024. 
Following a comprehensive review of operations, on 26 February 2020, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of 
the Group’s two remaining coal-fired generating units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022 (see note 5.1). This acceleration of 
the closure of the coal generation assets at Drax Power Station, along with a continued reduction in the interdependencies 
between the coal generation assets and the biomass generation assets at the site, has resulted in the coal generation assets 
becoming a separate CGU. The coal CGU has been reviewed for impairment and, as a result of this review, an asset obsolescence 
charge of £225.9 million has been recognised in the current year, of which £225.1 million relates to property plant and equipment. 
See note 2.7 for further details.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that 
these assets may be impaired. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review 
conducted during 2020, are set out in note 2.4.

Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period e.g. when an asset under construction is 
complete, it is transferred to the relevant depreciable asset category, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and maintenance 
projects. When spare parts are utilised in such projects, the net book value of the part is transferred from the property, plant and 
equipment balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.

3.2 Leases
Accounting policy
IFRS 16 determines a control model to distinguish between lease agreements and service contracts on the basis of whether the 
use of an identified asset is controlled by the Group for a period of time. If the Group is deemed to have control of an identified 
asset, then a lease is recognised on the balance sheet. A right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the discount rate that is 
implicit in the lease. If this discount rate cannot be determined from the agreement, the liability is discounted using an incremental 
borrowing rate. Incremental borrowing rates are calculated bi-annually. The borrowing rate for leased property is derived with 
reference to property yields specific to the location of the leased property and property type. For non-property leases, the 
borrowing rate is derived from a series of inputs including a risk-free rate based on LIBOR curves and an adjustment for credit  
risk based on the Group’s credit rating. The liability is subsequently adjusted for interest, repayments and other modifications. 
Lease modifications are accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or 
more underlying assets, and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price 
of the increase in scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is 
adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are accounted 
for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
Lease extension or termination options are included within the lease term when the Group, as the lessee, has the discretion to 
exercise the option and where it is probable that the option will be exercised.
Leases with a term shorter than 12 months or where the identified asset has a value below £3,500 are expensed to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.

to be held and not traded, in accordance with IFRS 9. Where quoted market prices are not available fair value is estimated based on 
all available information.

3.4 ROC assets
The Group earns ROC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), as a result of burning 
sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity at Drax Power Station and generating renewable energy at a certain 
number of the Group’s hydro plants. This note sets out the value of these assets that the Group held at the year end.
Accounting policy
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated 
sales prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction to costs of sales in that period.
Where the Customers business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices. Where 
relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle the Group’s own 
ROC obligations. Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred.
Historical experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may 
subsequently differ from those assumed.
ROC valuations are comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third-party supplier 
relating to the buy-out price and an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end 
of the compliance period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not 
procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are paid over to suppliers who presented ROCs in a compliance period on a 
pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and also the demand for ROCs 
over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition 
to its own forecasts in making these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable, but they remain 
subject to possible variation.

3.5 Inventories
The Group holds stocks of fuels and other consumable items that are used in the process of generating electricity and raw 
materials used in the production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of biomass, coal, other fuels and plant 
consumables held at the end of the year.
Accounting policy
The Group’s raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, 
including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support 
mechanism) and transport/handling costs. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs 
denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9,  
the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value and all such gains and losses are included in cost of sales when they arise.
Both biomass and coal inventories are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting the Group’s sites using technology 
regularly calibrated to industry standards. The Group does not anticipate purchasing any more coal inventory. Fuel burn in the 
electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing 
inventory volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error. All fuel inventories 
are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate.
Coal inventories are verified by an independent inventory survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision  
is made where the survey indicates a lower level of inventory than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being  
an independent process, the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.

The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. Biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes 
with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. 
Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated RADAR scanning technology to support the methods outlined above.

The net realisable value of coal in the table above is stated after provisions of £4.8 million (2019: £nil). The majority of this provision 
relates to inventory that the Group anticipates it will not be possible to utilise in the period before the coal units are closed in 
September 2022. 
Inventories of biomass at the 31 December 2020 include £3.1 million (2019: £2.6 million) of fibre and other raw materials to be 
utilised in the production of compressed wood pellets. 
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2020 was £1,045.8 million (2019: £1,001.3 million). 
This includes the value of write downs of inventory in the year described above of £4.8 million (2019: £nil) and the reversal of 
previously written down inventories of £0.2 million (2019: £nil).
3.6 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers for goods or services provided but that have not yet been paid for. 
Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be 
invoiced the following month.
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group has access to receivables monetisation facilities under which trade receivables can be sold to a third party on a 
non-recourse basis. Receivables sold under such facilities are accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) in accordance with IFRS 9 due to the objective of the business model being achieved by both collecting contractual 
cashflows and the selling of the financial assets. All receivables that fall under this business model are sold under these facilities. 
These receivables are derecognised at the point of sale which is shortly after the initial recognition of the receivable balance.  
As a result, no fair value gains or losses have been recognised. Fees are recognised in the income statement as incurred.

Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both the Generation and 
Customers businesses. At 31 December 2020, the Group had amounts receivable from two significant counterparties representing 
12% of total trade receivables and accrued income (2019: two significant counterparties representing 18% of total trade receivables 
and accrued income).
Of total trade receivables and accrued income at 31 December 2020, £257.4 million (2019: £275.0 million) relates to the  
Customers business.

Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the entitlement to 
consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time. The Group has recognised a contract asset for any 
services provided where payment is not yet due. The balances are included within accrued income. Any amount previously 
recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer, usually  
in the following financial period. The reconciliation from opening to closing contract assets is as follows:

Impairment of financial assets
Accounting policy 
The Group applies the impairment model in IFRS 9 to provide for expected credit losses on the Group’s financial assets including 
trade receivables, accrued income, contract assets and other financial assets. The provision for impairment of trade receivables 
(including accrued income) and contract assets is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. Contract 
assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts and therefore have substantially the same risk 
characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.
For other financial assets, the Group recognises a lifetime expected credit loss provision when there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group recognises a 12-month expected credit loss provision.
The greatest concentration of credit risk exists in the Customers business. The risk in this business is more prevalent within the 
SME customer base due to the wide range of customer characteristics within the portfolio. The loss provisioning for these 
customers is complex and requires a provisioning tool that is more dynamic than the provision matrix method. The provision matrix 
method is used for the Group’s larger consumers within the Customers business and customers within the Generation and Pellet 
Production businesses.
The Group considers default to be when a customer is in breach of its terms.
The Group writes off a financial asset when there is no realistic prospect of recovery and all attempts to recover the balance have 
been exhausted. An indication that all credit control activities have been exhausted is where the debt is greater than 365 days old 
or where there are insolvency issues relating to the customer. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
As a result of Covid-19, the Group has significantly increased its expectation of potential customer business failure rates and the 
resulting expected credit losses within the Customers business. Whilst the position adopted reflects the Group’s current best 
estimate of possible outcomes, actual rates of bad debt will depend upon the severity and depth of Covid-19. See page 152 for 
further details.
Combined probability method
During 2019, the Group implemented a new machine learning algorithm to calculate expected credit losses for its SME customer 
base. The algorithm predicts the future performance of a debt on an individual account basis using a broad range of indicators that 
are specific to the customer. The algorithm assesses the likelihood of the debt becoming more than 365 days past due and the 
likelihood of the customer subsequently defaulting on this debt. The algorithm combines historical default experience and 
economic conditions that may impact the probability of future defaults.
A binary method was adopted in 2019. This method provided in full for debt where the debt was more likely than not (i.e. more than 
50% probability) to become both aged over 365 days and then subsequently default. The Group considered that the overall provision 
applied from this method and other overlay assumptions was adequate to reflect the risk of default across the whole portfolio. 
Since initial implementation in 2019, the algorithm has continued to learn and develop, improving the accuracy of the provisioning 
estimations. The model no longer adopts a binary approach to the provisioning but instead calculates a specific probability of 
default for each customer which is then applied to the corresponding debt. The model is now trained on 2020 data and so 
incorporates experience of the Covid-19 impacted periods. A judgement overlay has also been included to capture Management’s 
estimation of residual risk relating to Covid-19 not yet fully reflected within the data that the model has been trained on.
The Group defines low credit risk as customers that have a probability of less than 25% of defaulting.

Provision matrix method
Larger customers within the Group are grouped according to the age of the debt based on the number of days past due.  
The provision rates are based on historical collection rates and an expectation of future cash collection. The rate of default 
increases once the balance is 30 days past due and subsequently in 30-day increments.
The movement in the overall allowance for expected credit losses is laid out in the following table:

The provision above relates to trade receivables in the Customers business. The risk of default within the Generation and Pellet 
Production businesses is considered to be extremely low and the calculated provision is negligible. This is supported by strong 
historic collection rates and timely receipts. The expected credit loss provision calculated for other financial assets of the Group 
was negligible. In terms of sensitivity, the year end provision represents 28% of the gross Customers trade receivables balance.  
If the coverage were to increase/(decrease) by 1%, the provision value would increase/(decrease) by £2.0 million. 
Credit and counterparty risk are disclosed in further detail in note 7.2. 
The net charge to the income statement in 2020 for impairment losses on financial assets was £43.1 million (2019: £18.0 million). 
This is the net of the additional amounts provided against in relation to trade receivables of £47.9 million (2019: £24.1 million) less  
a £4.8 million benefit in the period in respect of resolution of legacy credit balances (2019: £6.1 million benefit). 
The value of provisions calculated using the combined probability model is set out below. This shows the trade receivables 
balances for SME consumers within the Customers business grouped by the combined probability assigned by the model.

The expected credit loss rate is a weighted average for the portfolio of larger trade receivables associated with the Customers 
business. Contract assets, included within accrued income, and the majority of the trade receivables balances not yet due are held 
in the Generation business where the risk of default is considered to be extremely low and immaterial to provide for. This is 
supported by strong historic collection rates and timely receipts.
The provision for expected credit losses is implicit in the calculation of accrued income and as a result, the additional amounts 
provided against relating to accrued income of £3.5 million (2019: £5.8 million) are recognised as a reduction of revenue in the 
income statement.

3.7 Contract costs
The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the Customers business.
Accounting policy
Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts  
are recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs at the point the fee is paid. The fees are amortised  
on a straight-line basis over the contract period in line with the recognition of revenue. The balance is included within prepayments 
in note 3.6. This amount includes both current and non-current balances. No impairment losses were recognised in either year. The 
reconciliation from opening to closing contract costs is as follows:

3.8 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables represent amounts the Group owes to its suppliers (for trade purchases and ongoing costs), tax 
authorities and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. The Group makes accruals for amounts 
that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of the Group’s activities in the current period (e.g. fuel received but for which  
the Group has not yet been invoiced).
Accounting policy
Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.
The Group facilitates a supply chain finance scheme, a form of reverse factoring under which certain suppliers can obtain early 
access to funding. There are no changes to the Group’s payment terms under this arrangement, nor would there be if the 
arrangement was to fall away. The amount due is recognised in trade payables.
The Group also has access to payment facilities, utilised to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing. Under  
these facilities the Group benefits from a short extension to payment terms, within a normal working capital cycle, for a small fee.  
The original liability is derecognised and the amount due to the facility provider is recognised in other payables. Fees are 
recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.
The Group does not include trade and other payables in its calculation of net debt, see note 4.1.

Energy supply accruals includes £222.9 million (2019: £250.0 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising  
from Customers activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £35.4 million (2019: 
£42.8 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £31.6 million (2019: £30.4 million).
The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission 
Trading Scheme (ETS). Other accruals at 31 December 2020 includes £37.5 million (2019: £25.5 million) with respect to the Group’s 
estimated net liability to deliver carbon emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
Other accruals also includes accruals for capital and operating expenditure where the invoice has not yet been received.
Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas 
contracts, for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract. The balance reduces  
as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received. The reconciliation

Section 4: Financing and capital structure
This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from 
operations during the year.
4.1 Reconciliation of net debt
Net debt is calculated by taking the Group’s borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table 
below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

Borrowings include listed bonds, bank debt and revolving credit facilities (RCFs), net of any deferred finance costs. Borrowings do 
not include other financial liabilities such as IFRS 16 lease liabilities, pension obligations and trade and other payables.
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This reflects the 
nature of the contracts included in this balance which, prior to the application of IFRS 16, were predominantly not held on the 
balance sheet and instead disclosed as operating commitments.
A reconciliation of the change in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on page 185.
The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect  
of the Group’s US dollar (USD) and euro denominated debt (see note 4.3). If USD and euro balances were translated at the hedged 
rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings would be impacted. 
The table below reconciles net debt excluding the impact of hedging instruments, as disclosed in the table above, to net debt 
including the impact of hedging instruments through translating the borrowings at the hedged rates.

Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates  
to the principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable  
to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the  
life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Loan commitment fees payable to the lender, which entitle the Group to draw down  
at any time over a fixed period, but the repayment date is fixed regardless of when the loan is drawn down, are recognised on a 
systematic basis over the period the Group is able to draw down. Loan commitment fees payable to the lender, which entitle the 
Group to draw down at any time over a fixed period, but the loan has the same fixed term regardless of when the loan is drawn 
down, are deferred until draw down and recognised over the life of the instrument as part of the effective interest rate, if draw down 
is probable. If draw down is not probable they are recognised on a systematic basis over the period the Group is able to draw down.

4.3 Borrowings continued
Fees that are paid for the availability of a facility, such that the amount and timing of draw down can vary at the Group’s discretion 
(such as an RCF facility) are recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the facility.
Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with any exchange gains and 
losses arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign currency risk  
in accordance with the policy set out in note 7.2. Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt 
instruments, the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately on the balance sheet.

On 10 June 2020, the Group extended the final maturity on the £125.0 million ESG facility to 2025.
On 18 August 2020, the Group agreed a new infrastructure term loan facilities agreement providing committed facilities with a 
range of maturities between 2024 and 2030 further extending the Group’s debt maturity profile. The initial agreement included 
sterling denominated commitments of £45.0 million and euro denominated commitments totalling €126.5 million. The agreement 
also included an option for the Group to increase the facilities by up to a further £75.0 million of commitments, if agreed between  
the Group and its lenders. On 18 November 2020, a further £53.0 million with a 2028 maturity was agreed under this option.  
These commitments have effective interest rates of 3.7%, which is inside the Group’s current average cost of debt.
On 13 November 2020, the €31.5 million facility was drawn down, followed by £53.0 million on 2 December 2020. The remaining 
committed facilities were drawn on 18 February 2021.
On 4 November 2020, the Group issued €250.0 million of euro denominated senior secured notes, with a 2025 maturity date.  
The notes were issued at 100% of their nominal value and have a fixed interest rate of 2.625% which the Group has swapped  
back to achieve an effective sterling equivalent rate of 3.240%. 
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the variable and non-
sterling interest payments on the new infrastructure term loan facilities and euro notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of 
these interest payments over a three to six year period, the sterling repayment of the euro principals have been fixed for between 
two and five years.
On 19 November 2020, the Group used the proceeds of the euro denominated notes issue, along with existing cash reserves, to 
redeem the Group’s £350.0 million 2022 fixed loan notes as well as the £125.0 million ESG facility. The £350.0 million 2022 sterling 
notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.063% of the principal amount. The early redemption premium of 1.063% has been 
recognised as an exceptional item.
On 18 November 2020, the Group also refinanced its existing RCF which had a maturity date of 2021. The new ESG RCF facility has 
a value of £300.0 million and matures in 2025, with an option to extend by one year, with lender agreement. The facility is able to  
be fully drawn in cash. The facility includes an embedded ESG component which adjusts the margin based on the Group’s carbon 
intensity which is measured against an annual benchmark.
The Group’s financing structure also includes US $500.0 million loan notes and a £375.0 million UK infrastructure private 
placement which was committed and drawn in 2019.

The US senior secured notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.625% equating to an effective sterling interest rate of 4.9%. Cross-
currency interest rate swaps have been used to fix the sterling value of interest payments over a five-year period. This instrument 
also fixed the sterling repayment of the principal in 2023.
The £375.0 million LIBOR-linked UK infrastructure private placement agreed in 2019 has maturities extending out to between 2024 
and 2029. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to fix the effective interest rates inside the Group’s current cost of debt.

The Group’s financing structure, including the index-linked loan, the USD and euro loan notes, the ESG RCF, private placement and 
infrastructure term loan facilities are secured against the assets of a number of the Group’s subsidiaries including property, plant 
and equipment, with the exception of the Group’s US land and buildings.
In addition, the Group had a secured commodity trading line, which allowed it to transact prescribed volumes of commodity  
trades without the requirement to post collateral and FX trading lines with certain banks. Counterparties to these arrangements 
are entitled to share in the security as described above. During the year the Group opted to close the secured commodity trading 
line and as such no further trades are able to utilise the line. The final trades utilising this line are due to mature by the end of  
March 2021 and as at 31 December 2020 were valued at £0.8 million (2019: £32.7 million).

 Certain remeasurements of derivative contracts includes the effect of non-cash unrealised gains and losses recognised in the income statement and cash realised 
from derivative contracts designated into hedge relationships under IFRS 9, where the gain or loss is held in the hedge reserve pending release to the income 
statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs.
The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and managing liquidity. The Group optimises its working capital position  
by managing payables, receivables and inventories to make sure the working capital committed is closely aligned with operational 
requirements. When compared to the year-end position, such measures have been utilised to a broadly consistent level throughout 
the year unless otherwise stated. The impact of these actions on the cash flows of the Group is described below.
Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and ROC 
purchase arrangements the Group are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact of ROC 
purchases and ROC sales on operating cash flows was a £74.0 million outflow (2019: £131.2 million inflow), due to fewer ROCs being 
sold at the end of 2020 compared to the end of the previous year. This is reflected as an increase (2019: decrease) in ROC assets 
and is a component of the overall net decrease (2019: decrease) in ROC assets shown in the table above. The level of ROCs 
generated, purchased and sold during the period is set out in note 3.4. The Group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell  
ROC trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. These facilities were utilised during the year but no amounts remained outstanding 
at 31 December 2020 (2019: £nil).
188 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Section 4: Financing and capital structure continued
4.4 Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement continued
Utilisation of both of these methods to accelerate cash flows is higher around the middle of ROC compliance periods as the Group 
has generated a large amount of ROCs but energy suppliers do not yet require ROCs to settle their obligation. At the start of the 
compliance period the Group has not generated large amounts of ROCs, and towards the end of the compliance period energy 
suppliers are purchasing ROCs to settle their obligation, therefore utilisation of these methods is lower as the Group has less  
ROCs available.
From time to time, where market conditions change, the Group can rebase foreign currency contracts (including cross-currency 
interest rate swaps). In 2020, this generated a working capital outflow due to less cash being released from rebased trades at  
the end of 2020 than in the prior year. This is reflected as an adjustment to derivative remeasurements in the table on page 187.  
The total cash benefit released from related trades that remained outstanding at 31 December 2020 was £80.1 million (2019: 
£106.8 million). This cash benefit includes £24.4 million (2019: £84.3 million) released from foreign currency contracts and £55.7 
million (2019: £22.5 million) from cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables  
on a non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of £7.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2020, reflected as a 
reduction in receivables in the table on page 187 (2019: net cash inflow of £12.8 million reflected as a reduction in receivables  
in the table on page 187). The facility terms were amended in the prior year, increasing the facility size to £200.0 million from  
£150.0 million. Utilisation of the facility was £170.0 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: £162.2 million).
The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms  
and some reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be 
accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect the Group’s working capital, as payment terms 
remain unaltered with the Group. At 31 December 2020, the Group had trade payables of £43.7 million (2019: £33.1 million) related  
to reverse factoring. The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction 
processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short extension of payment terms within a normal 
working capital cycle. The amount outstanding under these facilities at 31 December 2020 was £63.6 million (2019: £90.6 million).

4.5 Equity and reserves
The Group’s ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London 
Stock Exchange.
Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities
This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other 
sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions.
5.1 Coal closure
On 26 February 2020, following a comprehensive review, the Board determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power 
Station in March 2021, with the two coal units remaining available to meet Capacity Market obligations until September 2022, at 
which point they will cease to operate.
Asset obsolescence charges
Drax Power Station’s biomass generation assets and coal generation assets had previously been assessed as being part of the 
same CGU, due to the interdependencies between these assets. Following a reduction in the significance of the interdependencies 
between these assets over time, as of 26 February 2020 they were assessed as being two separate CGUs. Following the coal 
generation assets becoming a separate CGU and the decision to cease commercial coal generation in March 2021, an impairment 
review was undertaken.
The recoverable amount of the coal generation assets was determined based on a value in use calculation. This calculation uses 
cash flow projections based on the Group’s established planning model approved by the Board covering the period through to coal 
closure in September 2022.
The calculation concluded that the recoverable amount of the coal CGU was significantly lower than the carrying amount of the 
coal generation assets in the Group’s balance sheet. Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2020, an asset obsolescence 
charge of £225.9 million has been recognised to write the coal generation assets down to their recoverable amount of £nil. 
Sensitivity analysis indicated that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions, which are the allocation of operating 
costs and discount rate, would not result in a materially different outcome. The discount rate used in the calculation was 8%.
The asset obsolescence charge and the associated deferred tax impact have been treated as exceptional items and excluded from 
the Group’s Adjusted Results.
Provisions
As a result of the coal closure decision, one-off costs of closure, comprising termination benefits, required safety works, and costs 
of disposal for associated assets will be incurred. The coal closure programme is expected to result in a reduction of 206 roles from 
April 2021. Communication and consultations have been taking place since the coal closure decision regarding the reduction in 
roles. These discussions and communications are sufficiently progressed that as at 31 December 2020 a restructuring provision of 
£9.6 million has been recognised for these expected costs. The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2021.

5.2 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired.
Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for 
that CGU assessed. The table below shows the carrying amount of goodwill:

Impairment review
Haven and Opus
The recoverable amounts of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs are measured annually, based on a value in use calculation. 
This calculation depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are customer margins and supply volumes. 
Estimates regarding these assumptions are based on management’s expectations of future growth, wholesale energy and 
third-party costs and achieved profitability. Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply 
costs. Management has projected cash flows based on a business plan period of eight years, reflecting consideration of aspects of 
the plan which are realised over a long term horizon. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using 
a growth rate of 1%. This growth rate is based on prudent expectations of market share and/or profitability along with more general 
macro environmental factors which were obtained from the Group’s established planning model along with external macro-
economic forecasts. The growth rate does not exceed the relevant long-term average growth rate for the industry. The impact  
of climate and environmental impacts are discussed in note 2.4. These businesses are principally focused on renewable electricity 
sales and therefore consideration of climate and environmental impacts are already a key feature of their business models.
The carrying amounts and discount rates applied to each CGU are set out in the table below:
CGU
Carrying 
Amount
£m
Discount 
Rate
Haven
47.5
7.2%
Opus
288.5
7.2%
The expected future cash flows of the CGU were discounted using a discount rate of 7.2%, calculated based on independent 
analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s Customers 
business. The Group believes that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-established Customers business, reflecting the 
comparatively long trading record and customer bases these businesses hold. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including 
the goodwill, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. Reflecting the significant headroom in the analysis, the Group does 
not believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in a recoverable amount for the Haven Power 
CGU that was lower than its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2020 includes intangible assets of £111.0 million. The discount rate 
was assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 7.2%. The recoverable amount of the Opus Energy CGU was assessed 
under several scenarios that reflect the Group’s future plans for the business. In each case, whilst headroom was materially 
reduced from prior years due to the impact of Covid-19 on forecasts of near-term future earnings, the recoverable amount 
remained in excess of its carrying amount assuming a recovery trajectory that returns to profitability. 
The Group conducted a sensitivity analysis on the estimates of future cash flows for the Opus Energy CGU and concluded that  
no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions would result in the recoverable amount falling below its carrying 
amount. It was noted that EBITDA forecasts in the business plan period would need to fall by a further 53% to completely erode 
available headroom.
Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan
The Group tests the goodwill associated with the Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan CGUs annually. The recoverable amount of each 
CGU was calculated based on a value in use calculation using the Group’s established planning model. The model depends on a 
broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are power prices, operating model, sources of stability income and the 
discount rate applied. Estimates regarding these assumptions are based on management’s expectations of future wholesale 
energy prices, operational factors and capital investment. Management has projected cash flows based on the business plan period 
of 14 years. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2%. This growth rate is 
based on macro environmental factors which were obtained from publicly available forecasts and does not exceed the relevant 
long-term average growth rate for the industry. The impact of climate and environmental impacts have been discussed in note 2.4.
The carrying amounts and discount rates applied to each CGU are set out in the table below:

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued
5.2 Goodwill continued
The value in use for the Cruachan CGU in the table above, including allocated goodwill, was significantly in excess of its 
carrying amount. No reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in a recoverable amount that was lower than 
its carrying amount.
The nature of the run-of-river assets and the application of fair value accounting on acquisition in 2018 results in a limited level of 
headroom for the Lanark and Galloway CGUs of £4 million and £13 million respectively. The value in use calculations for Lanark and 
Galloway are sensitive to the discount rate applied. An increase in the discount rate of 0.5% for Lanark and 0.4% for Galloway would 
result in a recoverable amount that was lower than the carrying amount for each CGU. Having conducted a sensitivity analysis  
of all key assumptions, no other reasonable possible changes that would result in the elimination of all headroom were identified.  
It is not expected that there would be any reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would result in a material 
impairment loss in the next 12 months.
5.3 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired 
in business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely 
purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.
Accounting policy
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are 
measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the 
asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No 
changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2020. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and 
are explained in further detail below.
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand 
are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2.

5.3 Intangible assets continued
Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, 
which provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211.0 million 
reflected the estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent 
upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have 
been discounted using a discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has an estimated useful life from acquisition of 11 years, calculated based 
on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract 
renewals over time.
Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11.3 million on a relief-from-royalty 
method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10-year useful life from acquisition.
Computer software
Additions in the period include those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business 
systems to support the Customers segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives 
ranging from three to five years.
As at 31 December 2020, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to £30.7 million (2019: £40.5 million). 
This includes £19.2 million (2019: £19.2 million) for a billing system where the Group has stopped development in 2019 and is 
engaged in active discussion with the supplier reflecting the supplier’s failure to perform under this contract. No amounts have 
been provided in respect of these assets as the Group believes that the carrying amount will be recovered in full, supported by legal 
advice.
Development assets
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four OCGT projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning and 
consents. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and are 
subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. We believe there is a need for flexible, dispatchable generation, but this 
must support the UK’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
At 31 December 2020, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value in use calculation derived 
from the Group’s established planning model. The assessment incorporated key assumptions related to likely Capacity Market 
clearing prices, construction costs, and the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed. The Group’s 
primary focus is on flexible and renewable generation; however the Group continues to see an important role for gas in the 
provision of system support and we believe the OCGT projects are an attractive means though which these services could be 
provided. Accordingly, the Group remains committed to the development of options for the OCGT projects and expects to recover 
the carrying amount in full.
The analysis assumed a Capacity Market clearing price that was higher than recently observed clearing prices but was supported 
by independent forecasts of future prices.
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a rate of 7%, which included an assessment of the level of construction and 
execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed. The analysis indicated a recoverable amount in 
excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets, with headroom in excess of £50 million. The analysis is sensitive 
to the key assumptions described above and the discount rate applied. Set out below are the individual changes in these 
assumptions that would result in a recoverable amount that is less than the carrying amount. Whilst all of these changes would not 
be expected to arise in the next 12 months, a combination of smaller changes across these assumptions could be reasonably 
possible to erode headroom to £nil.
• Increasing the discount rate by approximately 1.8%
• A reduction in the Capacity Market clearing price forecast of 34%
• An increase in the total construction cost of 21%
• A reduction in system stability revenue streams of 54%
If any of these circumstances were to materialise, individually or in aggregate and without mitigation, the Group may not proceed 
with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet may be impaired. In particular, the analysis depends 
upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions.
Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of carbon emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions 
Trading Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short term 
nature, carbon assets are not amortised.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation 
for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the 
extent further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.
194 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued
5.4 Provisions
The Group makes provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing its generation 
assets and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. Other provisions are made when the Group 
has an obligation as a result of an event occurring in the period. During 2020, the Group has recognised a restructuring provision in 
respect of coal closure. 
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s 
generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a 
site-by-site basis and represents the present value of the expected costs. The discount rate used is a risk-free rate that reflects the 
duration of the liability. The average discount rate used across the Group’s decommissioning provisions is 0.75% (2019: 1.20%). The 
use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount 
equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives 
of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
The Group recognises a restructuring provision when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a 
valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring either by starting to implement the plan or announcing its 
main features to those affected by it. The restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the 
restructuring programme, these are costs that would have been avoided if the restructuring programme did not go ahead. Any 
costs to be incurred relating to the ongoing activities of the Group are excluded from the provision.
A provision for termination benefits is recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the 
termination benefit and when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation costs for leased offices.

Of the restructuring provision an immaterial amount is expected to be utilised in 2021.
Decommissioning provisions are made in respect of the Group’s thermal generating plants (Drax Power Station and CCGT power 
stations). The most recent updates took place in December 2020 for Drax Power Station, and September 2020 for CCGT sites. The 
provision related to the CCGT sites was transferred to liabilities held for sale during the year.
Decommissioning provisions are based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end 
of the expected useful life of each site (which varies between 2026 and 2039) and has been estimated using existing technology at 
current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. During the year a comprehensive 
decommissioning assessment was performed as part of the future planning for the site at Drax Power Station. This resulted in an 
increase in the provision of £28.9 million.

5.5 Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Assets held for sale are non-current assets (or disposal groups) whose carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. If a component of an entity is disposed of or classified as held for sale its results 
are classified as a discontinued operation.
Non-current assets and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in 
the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the 
balance sheet.
Accounting policy
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) whose carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
continuing use are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and if the sale is 
considered highly probable. A sale is deemed highly probable if all the following criteria are met:
• the appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group)
• an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated
• the asset (or disposal group) are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and
• the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Once an asset (or disposal group) has been classified as held for sale it is recognised at the lower of its carrying value and fair value 
less costs to sell, except for deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets, investment properties 
measured at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are exempt from this requirement and continue to 
be measured in line with their relevant IFRS requirements.
Impairment losses and subsequent reversals of impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Reversals of 
impairment losses are only recognised to the extent they reverse a prior impairment. If an impairment loss is recognised in relation 
to a disposal group the impairment would be allocated first to goodwill and then on a pro-rata basis to the non-current assets 
within the disposal group.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that meets one of the following criteria:
• represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations
• is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
The component is classified as a discontinued operation at the earlier of when it is disposed of or when the component meets the 
held for sale criteria.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation its results are presented separately in the income statement. The 
results of the discontinued operation are also re-presented in the income statement as discontinued in any comparative periods.
Assets held for sale
On 15 December 2020, the Group announced it had reached agreement for the sale of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (DGEL), 
which held the Group’s CCGT power stations, to VPI Generation Limited for headline cash consideration of up to £193 million, 
subject to customary adjustments. This included £29 million of contingent consideration associated with the option to develop a 
new CCGT at Damhead Creek. Accordingly, these assets are a disposal group and have been recognised as held for sale at 31 
December 2020. The sale subsequently completed on 31 January 2021. The results of these operations previously formed part of 
the Generation segment for segmental reporting. The assets were disposed of as the assets did not form part of the Group’s core 
flexible and renewable generation strategy.
The following assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale in relation to the agreed sale of DGEL:

On 8 February 2021, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (Pinnacle), which is subject 
to the approval of Drax and Pinnacle shareholders, court approval and regulatory approvals. If all required approvals are received, 
the acquisition is expected to complete in the second or third quarter of 2021. Under the acquisition agreement, Drax will acquire 
the entire issued share capital of Pinnacle, valuing the fully diluted equity of Pinnacle at C$385 million (£226 million at a rate of 
C$1.7/£), with an enterprise value of C$741 million, including C$356 million of net debt.

The Group restructured the staff hierarchies of certain employees during the year. The restructure saw employees within 
administrative functions that were previously allocated to the Generation and Customers business units now allocated to Central 
and administrative functions, with costs directly attributable to business units being recharged. The 2019 comparatives have been 
re-presented to reflect what the comparative would have been under this new structure.
6.2 Share-based payments
The Group operates three share option schemes for employees: the Long Term Incentive Plan 2020 (LTIP 2020) for Executive 
Directors and senior employees (which replaced the Performance Share Plan (PSP) from 2020), the Deferred Share Plan (DSP) for 
Executive Directors, and the Sharesave Plan (SAYE) for all UK qualifying employees. The Group incurs a non-cash charge in respect 
of these schemes in the income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the 
number of options outstanding.
In the year the Group has granted share appreciation rights (SARs) to employees in the form of “One Drax Awards”. No Executive 
Directors participate in these awards. These are cash awards that are tracked by reference to the Group share price over the 
vesting period. At the grant date of the award the employee is granted a number of phantom shares based on the value of the cash 
award divided by the Group share price at the date of the grant. At the end of the vesting period, the employee receives the cash 
award based on the Group share price at the date of vesting.
Accounting policy
The LTIP 2020, PSP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured  
at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Section 6: Our people continued
6.2 Share-based payments continued
The One Drax Awards are cash-settled share-based payments. Cash-settled share-based payments are recognised as a liability, 
with the corresponding expense recognised as an employee benefit expense. Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value. The fair value of the amount to be paid under cash-settled share-based payments is recognised as an expense over the 
period the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the payment. The fair value of the liability for cash-settled share-based 
payments is remeasured at each reporting date and at the settlement date.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows:

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching 
shares were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares 
borne by the Group. There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

Long Term Incentive Plan 2020 (LTIP 2020)
The LTIP 2020 was introduced in 2020 for executive directors and senior employees. This replaced the Performance Share Plan 
which operated from 2017 to 2019 (see below). Under the LTIP 2020, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are 
made for no consideration to Executive Directors and other senior employees up to a maximum of 200% of their annual base salary. 
Vesting of a proportion of shares (50%) is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or 
outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares 
(50%) is conditional upon performance of Cumulative Adjusted EPS over three years.
The fair value of the LTIP awards of £3.1 million made in 2020 is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the three-year vesting period. The fair value of LTIP 2020 awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes 
into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2020 awards are 
the share price at the grant date of 203 pence, expected volatility of 37%, and risk-free interest rate of 0.05%.
Movements in the number of shares outstanding for the LTIP 2020 is shown below. As this is a new scheme in the year, there are no 
comparatives presented:

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP was introduced for executive directors and senior employees to replace the BMP from 2017. Under the PSP, annual awards 
of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration up to a maximum of 175% of their annual base salary. 
Vesting of a proportion of shares (50%) was conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or 
outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares is 
conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. No PSP awards were granted in 2020.

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2019: nil).
The weighted average share price of options exercised during the period at the date of exercise was 202 pence.
Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
In addition, the Group operates the DSP, under which executive directors defer into shares a minimum of 40% (2019: 35%) of their 
annual bonus. DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” 
termination provisions. The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2020 was 149 pence (2019: 378 pence) and the 
fair value of these awards of £0.3 million (2019: £1.9 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the three-year vesting period.
The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability 
of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2020 awards are the share price at date of grant, 
expected volatility of 37% (2019: 35%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.05% (2019: 0.98%).

Sharesave Plan (SAYE)
In March 2020, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all UK qualifying employees. Options were granted for 
employees to acquire shares at a price of 127 pence (2019: 298 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market 
price determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings 
contracts. The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of £4.9 million (2019: £2.8 million) is being

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five 
years respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 296 pence (2019: 
325 pence).
The range of exercise prices of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was between 127 pence and 298 pence (2019: 
203 pence and 319 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life was 33 months (2019: 26 months).
The number of options exercisable at the year end was 3,857 (2019: nil).
One Drax Awards
The One Drax Award scheme is a SAR scheme that awards certain employees phantom shares. These shares are to be retained by 
the employee for a period of one year. The number of phantom shares awarded to the employees is calculated by taking the cash 
value awarded, divided by the Drax Group share price at the grant date. The phantom shares are tracked on the Drax Group share 
price over the retention period and, at the end of this period, the intrinsic value of the phantom shares is paid to the employees.  
The Group records a liability for the amount of cash to be paid to the employees calculated at FVTPL. The fair value of the SARs are 
determined by reference to the share price.
All awards issued were settled before the year, as a result, there was no liability recognised at 31 December 2020 or 31 December 
2019.
Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report on 
page 108.

Trustee governance (defined benefit pension schemes)
The UK defined benefit plans are administered by a separate board of trustees, which is legally separate from the Company.  
The trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The trustees are required by law to act in the 
interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy for the assets and the day-to-day administration 
of the benefits.
Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle 
them to the contributions. The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due  
to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial 
gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised 
immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it 
occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which  
they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.
Significant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, 
including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are 
reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under 
the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of pension scheme actuaries. However, 
actual results may differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2020 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period, other than inflation, 
which has taken account of the expected changes as a result of RPI reform. The assumptions have been prepared in accordance 
with independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates four defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution 
schemes are as follows:

been paid over to the schemes. The Group has no further outstanding payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit schemes
The pension surplus and liability are shown gross on the Balance Sheet as there is no legal right of offset between the two defined 
benefit pension schemes. The net pension surplus for the two defined benefit pension schemes is as follows:

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The DPG section of the ESPS and the Drax 2019 scheme are collectively referred to as the Defined Benefit Schemes or the 
Schemes below. At 31 December 2020, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Defined Benefit Schemes, 
which are described in further detail below, continued to result in a net position of surplus assets over liabilities. 
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they had qualified through being existing 
members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the 
scheme. Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of 
service plus a tax-free lump sum of three-times pension.
On 31 December 2018, Drax completed a transaction to acquire assets from ScottishPower. Under the terms of the Sale and 
Purchase Agreement, employees with defined benefit pension rights were also transferred to Drax. 
Over the summer of 2019 each transferring member was given the option to either transfer their past service benefits into the Drax 
2019 Scheme or keep their past service in the ScottishPower Pension Scheme. As part of this, 81 members agreed to transfer their 
past service into the Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme. From 1 January 2020, a further 15 members have begun to build up future 
service within the Drax 2019 Scheme.
Under the Drax 2019 Scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final salary on attainment of retirement age 
(or earlier withdrawal or death). No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The Scheme is open to future accrual of benefits 
but closed to new members.
The Schemes expose the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk
The Schemes’ liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond 
yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The ESPS Scheme holds a significant 
proportion of growth assets (diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, 
though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short 
term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given this Scheme’s 
long-term objectives.
Discount rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the Schemes’ liabilities, although 
this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes’ bond holdings.
Longevity risk
The majority of the Schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk
The majority of the Schemes’ obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher 
inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the Scheme are either unaffected 
by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. 
In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The 
Schemes have a significant holding in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk 
is hedged.
Credit risk
A proportion of the Schemes’ funded liabilities are currently hedged against interest rates and inflation 
using liability-driven investments. Note that the Schemes hedge interest rate risk on a statutory and 
long-term funding basis (gilts) whereas AA corporate bonds are implicit in the IAS 19 discount rate and 
so there is some mismatching risk to the Group should yields on gilts and corporate bonds diverge. The 
Schemes’ exposure to corporate bonds mitigates this risk to some extent.
Risk management
The Company and trustees have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when 
appropriate. This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the 
funding level of the Scheme by investing in assets that perform in line with the liabilities of the Scheme 
so as to protect against interest rates being lower or inflation being higher than expected.
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing 
the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of 
members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits are payable on death 
before retirement.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 
2019. The actuarial review at 31 December 2020 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The 
scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the 
scheme cost. 
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2019 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account 
experience over the period since that date, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic 
assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the 
projected unit credit method.

The 2019 Scheme is yet to have completed its first triennial valuation. Work commenced on the first valuation dated 31 March 2020 
and is expected to conclude in 2021.
The principal assumptions for the Schemes are set out below. Where absolute assumptions differ between the two schemes, 
reflecting differences in the expected duration of the scheme liabilities, a weighted average is shown.

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future 
improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2020 will live, on average, for a further 26 years  
if they are male (2019: 26 years) and for a further 28 years if they are female (2019: 28 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male 
and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 29 years respectively (2019: 27 and 29 years respectively). 
The expected duration of the DPG ESPS at 31 December 2020 based on the IAS 19 position was around 20 years (2019: around 20 
years). The expected duration of the 2019 Scheme at 31 December 2020 based on the IAS 19 position was 25 years (2019: 25 years).
The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Schemes is the excess of the fair value of the plan assets over  
the present value of the defined benefit obligation, determined as follows:

The past service cost relates to an increase in pension liability as a result of coal closure, further details can be found in note 5.1. The 
calculation was performed by a qualified actuary using the same assumptions as those applied to the rest of the scheme and the past 
service cost represents the difference between the liability relating to the standard Group benefits as per the current reserve in the 
calculation of the Group’s IAS 19 position and the corresponding liability in respect of the equivalent redundancy benefits offered to 
those employees to be made redundant.

As described in note 5.5 on 31 January the Group disposed of the CCGT portfolio. This led to 42 members, of a pre-transaction total 
of 96, ceasing to accrue benefits in the Drax 2019 Scheme. However, the pension scheme did not form part of the transaction and 
therefore the assets and liabilities in relation to the Drax 2019 Scheme will remain on the Group’s Balance Sheet. 
The actuarial losses of £30.5 million (2019: losses of £49.8 million) reflect losses of £30.0 million arising from changes in financial 
assumptions (2019: losses of £50.3 million), gains arising from scheme experience of £0.3 million (2019: losses of £3.4 million) and 
losses of £0.8 million arising from changes in demographic assumptions (2019: gains of £3.9 million).
The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities 
arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 1.5% (2019: 2.1%) following decreases in corporate bond yields.

driven investing (40%) and long lease property (10%). The 2019 scheme’s long term investment strategy is to move gradually towards a fully hedged position but  
to maintain assets which generate returns such as equity options, swap options and credit strategy
(2)  Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds
(3)  Other assets include £24.2 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2019: £19.4 million).  
The fair value of these investments is derived in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines. All other assets are 
quoted in an active market Cash and other assets include £22.3 million in relation to a strategy to hedge liabilities and achieve active exposure  
to equity returns
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have  
a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus. The following table provides an indication of the

Note:

 The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation
The Group is exposed to investment and other risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where  
it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
The sensitivity on discount rate above is lower than the actual rate of change experienced during 2020. However, given events  
and circumstances in 2020 (Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit uncertainty, US Presidential elections) we do not anticipate the same level 
of movement going forwards, and therefore 0.25% is deemed an appropriate sensitivity to apply.
The DPG ESPS defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (50%), former employees of the 
Group who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (45%). 
Future contributions
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently (i.e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing 
benefits). 
The last actuarial valuation of the DPG section of the ESPS was carried out by the Trustee’s actuarial advisers, Aon Hewitt, as at 
31 March 2019. The 2019 Scheme is yet to have completed its first triennial valuation. Work commenced on the first valuation dated 
31 March 2020 and is expected to conclude in 2021.
Such valuations are required by law to take place at intervals of no more than three years. Following each valuation, the Trustees 
and the Group must agree the contributions required (if any) such that the schemes are fully funded over time on the basis of 
suitably prudent assumptions. The next funding valuation of the DPG Section of the ESPS is due no later than 31 March 2022, at 
which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed. 
Following the latest actuarial valuation of the DPG Section of the ESPS, the Group agreed to repair the funding deficit of 
£35.9 million as at 31 March 2019 over the period to 30 June 2024, subject to the actuarial assumptions adopted for the triennial 
valuation as at 31 March 2019 being borne out in practice. The agreement includes payments of £7.2 million per annum (indexed 
with RPI) to be paid until 30 June 2024. 
The Group expects to make total contributions of £13.4 million to the Schemes during the 12 months ended 31 December 2021.
The Group has also agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the self-sufficiency 
deficit. At this point the scheme is expected to be self-sufficient and fully funded, unless material adverse changes in economic 
conditions arise compared to those assumed in the valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are 
manageable within the Group’s business plan. 
The Trust Deed provides the DPG section of the ESPS with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the 
gradual settlement of plan liabilities over time. Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business the Trustees have no right to 
unilaterally wind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of the DPG section of the ESPS. Based on these rights,  
any net surplus in the plan is recognised in full.

Section 7: Risk management
This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments the Group uses to mitigate 
such risks.
7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values
The Group hold a variety of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, 
payables and receivables arising from operations.
Accounting classifications and fair values
The tables below show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, including their levels in the fair value 
hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the 
carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 
3.6) and trade and other payables (note 3.8) generally have a short time to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values, on the 
historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan 
notes and amounts drawn against term loans (note 4.3). These financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost.

 The UK inflation rate swaps contain unobservable inputs in their fair value valuation techniques. However, these unobservable inputs are not material to the 
valuation and therefore they have been categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy in line with IFRS 13.
The derivative financial instruments used by the Group and not subject to the own-use exemption have been categorised as follows:
• Commodity contracts – forward contracts for the sale or purchase of a physical commodity which is expected to be settled through 
physical delivery of the commodity.
• Financial contracts – freight and weather-related contracts, as well as contracts for commodities that are not expected to be settled 
through physical delivery of the commodity.
• Foreign currency exchange contracts – currency related contracts including forwards, vanilla options, structured option products.
• Interest rate and cross-currency contracts – contracts which swap one interest rate for another in a single currency, including 
floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, contracts which swap interest and principal cash flows in one currency for another currency, 
including fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps, and interest swaptions.
• Inflation rate swaps – swap contracts, such as floating-to-fixed, which are linked to an inflation index such as RPI or CPI, and inflation 
swaptions.
208 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Section 7: Risk management continued
7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued
Fair value measurement
• Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is 
calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
• Financial contracts fair value – The fair value of financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is calculated by 
reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
• Foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using 
forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
• Interest rate and cross-currency contracts – The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to forward market curves 
at the balance sheet date for the relevant interest index. The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is calculated using the 
relevant forward currency exchange market rates for fixed-to-fixed swaps and by using the relevant forward currency exchange 
market rates and interest index for floating-to-fixed swaps.
• Inflation rate swaps – The fair value of inflation rate swaps is calculated by reference to forward market curves at the balance sheet 
date for the relevant inflation index.
Given the maturity profile of all these contracts, liquid forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. The 2025 USD loan notes, the 2025 
EUR loan notes, and the infrastructure term loan facilities, all contain early repayment options that meet the definition of 
embedded derivatives. However, in all cases, these do not require separate valuation as they are deemed to be closely related  
to the host contract.
IFRS 13 requires categorisation of the Group’s financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain 
the basis on which their fair values have been determined:
• Level 1 – Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
• Level 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices, included within Level 1, that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair value of commodity contracts, financial contracts, foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate and cross-currency 
contracts, and US inflation swaps are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; 
therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
The fair value of the UK inflation swaps comprises an RPI and CPI component. Whilst the RPI component is based on observable 
market rates, CPI is based on unobservable rates and therefore deemed to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. However, this 
component is not material to the overall valuation and therefore the instruments as a whole are determined to be Level 2 in line 
with IFRS 13.
The valuation technique used for non-listed equity investments comprises unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as 
Level 3. However, given the valuations as a whole for Level 3 equity investments are immaterial, it is not deemed necessary to 
include all Level 3 disclosures.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
Accounting for derivatives
Derivatives (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference 
between the price the Group has secured in the contract, and the price the Group could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve and cost of hedge reserve, 
dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS 9 (see note 7.2).
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from 
fair value marked-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the 
Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements.

7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued
Contracts for non-financial assets which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial 
coal and carbon emissions allowances – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the 
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.3) to the extent that the contracts 
are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements 
are not met. To ensure these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the 
Adjusted Results in the income statement.
The Group’s biomass risk management policy permits some flexibility in trading activity to optimise the overall portfolio position 
and potentially release value in certain, limited circumstances. As such the own-use exemption would likely not apply to these 
biomass contracts. However the nature of these contracts means they cannot be readily net settled in cash or other financial 
instruments and, as a result, they remain outside of the scope of IFRS 9.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets 
or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

7.2 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate 
risk, inflation risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on 
the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the risk 
management committees as explained in the principal risks and uncertainties section (page 66) which identify, evaluate and 
hedge financial risks in close co-ordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board 
of directors.
7.2.1 Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of power, gas, sustainable wood fibre 
and pellets, other fuels and the price of carbon emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically 
influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices and the impact on profit after tax 
and other components of equity of reasonably possible increases/decreases in commodity prices. The analysis assumes all other 
variables were held constant.
As a result of the increased volatility, predominantly due to Covid-19, sensitivities for larger changes in prices have been included in 
the current year.

Profit after tax is sensitive to increases/decreases in commodity prices as a result of the impact on the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are sensitive to 
increases/decreases in commodity price risk in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements. Profit after tax is 
sensitive to power and carbon price changes in the current year due to the discontinuance of hedge accounting relating to certain 
power and caron trades in the year. See below for further details on the power and carbon trades for which hedge accounting has 
been discontinued.
Commodity risk management
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and carbon emissions allowances when profitable to do 
so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. Forward power sales can be secured up to 100% of forecast availability 
two years out. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the 
Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of power.
The Group purchases sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities 
principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. If these 
contracts are within the scope of IFRS 9, the Group, where possible, either applies the own-use exemption or hedge accounting  
in accordance with IFRS 9. If the own-use exemption or hedge accounting are not applicable then the contracts are recognised  
at fair value through profit or loss.
Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of 
power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of Customers’ customers 
and the CCGT assets as a fuel for its gas-fired generation portfolio.
The Group purchases carbon emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of 
domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase carbon emissions allowances under fixed price contracts were 
previously designated as cash flow hedges as they reduced the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price 
of carbon emissions allowances. However, in 2020, as a result of the UK leaving the EU and the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) 
no longer applying to the Group, hedge accounting of carbon was discontinued in the year. See the hedge accounting section 
below for further details.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power and purchase carbon). 
Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the 
effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then 
released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is at the 
point when the underlying power is delivered.
Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released 
to the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement 
on continuing hedges in the year (2019: £nil). Due to the use of ‘all-in-one’ hedges, this results in the movement in value for the 
hedged items and hedging instruments being identical.
The only source of ineffectiveness regarding the “all-in-one” hedges would be if delivery of the commodities was no longer 
expected to occur, which would result in hedge accounting being discontinued. The main sources of ineffectiveness regarding 
financial contracts would be as a result of timing differences and credit risk.
In February 2020, the Group announced its decision to cease commercial coal generation in March 2021, ahead of the 2025 
deadline. The Group had a number of financial contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges in relation to the forecast 
purchases of coal. As a result of this decision, the Group’s forecast coal requirements were reduced. This resulted in the cash flows 
for the purchase of coal, that the financial coal contracts were hedging, no longer being expected to occur. The hedges therefore  
no longer met the hedge accounting requirements, and accordingly, all gains or losses relating to these hedges were reclassified to 
the income statement. This resulted in a loss of £5.6 million being reclassified to the income statement.
The Group has a number of forward purchase contracts for carbon to hedge its exposure to carbon prices under the EU ETS. 
During the year it became clear that the UK was intending to set up a separate ETS once the UK had left the EU. As a result,  
the purchases of EU carbon emissions allowances, that were hedge accounted, were no longer expected to occur. At this point 
hedge accounting was discontinued and any gains or losses accumulated in the hedge reserve were reclassified to the income 
statement. This resulted in a gain of £1.7 million being reclassified to the income statement, of which £0.7 million related to 
discontinued operations.
The Group also has a number of forward sale contracts for power relating to forecast generation from the CCGT assets that are 
designated as cash flow hedges. As a result of the sale of the CCGT assets on 31 January 2021, the cash flow hedges in relation  
to forecast generation of the CCGT assets in the period post 31 January 2021 no longer meet the hedge accounting requirements. 
This is due to the forecast transactions for the sale of power no longer being expected to occur from the Group’s perspective. As 
such, at the point the forecast transactions were deemed as no longer being expected to occur, hedge accounting for these 
transactions was discontinued, with the gains or losses on these contracts being reclassified to the income statement. This 
resulted in a £25.3 million loss on forward power contracts being reclassified to the income statement within discontinued 
operations.
A net £2.6 million loss has been recognised in the year on derivative contracts relating to the period after disposal of the CCGT 
assets on 31 January 2021. This includes the above £25.3 million loss on power trades, a gain of £17.5 million relating to gas trades, 
and a gain of £5.2 million relating to carbon trades. All of these amounts are included within discontinued operations.
All subsequent fair value movements on hedges that have been discontinued are recognised in the income statement.
The reconciliation of the reserves and time period when the hedge will affect the profit or loss are disclosed in note 7.3.

The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented  
in the table below.
The average forward rates quoted below only reflect the rates applicable to the portion of the Group’s commodity and financial 
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. The rates do not reflect the overall average rate of the 
Group’s total portfolio of commodity and financial contracts that are used to protect the value of future cash flows.

7.2.2 Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency rates as a result of committed and forecast transactions in foreign 
currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Generation business and principal and interest payments 
relating to foreign currency denominated debt. These fuel purchases are typically denominated in US dollars (USD), Canadian 
dollars (CAD) or Euros (EUR), and the foreign currency debt is denominated in USD and EUR.
The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc.
Foreign currency sensitivity
The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of reasonably possible strengthening/
weakening of currencies against GBP. The analysis assumes all other variables were held constant.
As a result of the increased volatility, predominantly due to Covid-19, sensitivities for larger changes in exchange rates have been 
included in the current year.

Profit after tax is sensitive to the strengthening/weakening of other currencies as a result of the impact on the fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. The Group designates certain 
foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are 
sensitive to the strengthening/weakening of other currencies in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements.
Foreign currency risk management
It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign 
currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative 
contracts in line with the currency risk management policy, including forwards and options, to manage the risks associated with  
its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period, covering contracted exposures and a proportion of 
highly probable forecast transactions.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in USD and EUR (see 
note 4.3). The Group utilises derivative contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, to manage exchange risk on foreign 
currency debt.
214 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
Section 7: Risk management continued
7.2 Financial risk management continued
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain foreign currency exchange contracts as hedging instruments. Foreign currency exchange contracts 
that are designated as hedges are transferred from equity to inventory for hedges of fuel purchases or transferred to intangible 
assets for hedges of carbon EUAs. However, in 2020, as a result of the UK leaving the EU and the EU ETS no longer applying to the 
Group, hedge accounting of carbon was discontinued in the year. See the hedge accounting section below for further details.
Cross-currency interest rate swap gains and losses that are effective at hedging the foreign exchange risk on the interest 
payments are released to interest payable and similar charges. Gains and losses that are effective at hedging the foreign exchange 
risk on the USD or EUR principal are released to foreign exchange gains/(losses) to offset gains and losses on retranslating the 
USD and euro denominated hedged borrowings.
The Group has taken out a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with 
USD $500 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows. The Group has also taken 
out a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with €250 million 2025 fixed rate 
loan notes to again fix the sterling cash flows payable on the debt. On the EUR denominated facilities agreed as part of the new 
infrastructure term loan, both drawn and committed, the Group has fixed the sterling cash flows payable on this debt through a 
combination of fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to foreign currency exchange contracts are timing differences and credit risk. The 
main sources of ineffectiveness relating to cross-currency interest rate swaps are differences in the critical terms, differences in 
repricing dates and credit risk.
The reconciliation of the reserves and when the amount will affect the income statement or will be removed from equity and 
included in the initial cost of the non-financial item are disclosed in notes 7.3 and 7.4.
The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in the 
table below. Ineffectiveness on foreign currency exchange contracts is recognised in cost of sales if it relates to hedges of biomass. 
Ineffectiveness on cross-currency interest rate swaps that are hedging principal and interest payments are recognised in interest 
payable and similar charges if the ineffectiveness relates to interest payments, and foreign exchange losses/(gains) if it relates to 
the principal repayment.
There are €95 million of floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps that are hedging both foreign currency risk and 
interest rate risk. These swaps have been separated into synthetic floating-to-floating cross-currency interest rate swaps, that are 
hedging foreign currency risk, and synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps, that are hedging interest rate risk. The 
synthetic floating-to floating cross-currency interest rate swaps are disclosed in this section, and the synthetic floating-to-fixed 
GBP interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 7.2.3 relating to interest rate risk.
The average forward rates quoted below only reflect the rates applicable to the portion of the Group’s foreign currency hedging 
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. The rates do not reflect the overall average rate of the 
Group’s total portfolio of currency derivatives that are used to protect the sterling value of future cash flows.

7.2.3 Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to variable rate debt, cash and cash equivalents and the RCF, 
should it be drawn. The Group has taken out a LIBOR floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to fix the interest payments on the £375 
million private placement issued in 2019. On the new infrastructure term loan facilities that were agreed in the year, both drawn 
and committed, the Group has fixed the interest rate payable on the £98 million of GBP denominated facilities through floating-to-
fixed LIBOR interest rate swaps. The Group has also fixed the interest rate payable on the variable rate euro denominated debt 
through floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps. As detailed in section 7.2.2 above, the floating-to-fixed cross-currency 
interest rate swaps are hedging both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, as such the disclosures relating to interest rate risk 
are included in this section. See note 7.2.2 for the foreign currency risk disclosures relating to the floating-to-fixed cross-currency 
interest rate swaps
At December 2020, the Group has fixed all of its debt instruments through the use of swaps and therefore has no variable rate debt 
once the impact of the swaps is considered.
The return generated on the Group’s cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the RCF are also exposed to movements in short-term 
interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity.
Further information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided 
in note 4.3.
Interest rate benchmark reform
The only interest rate benchmarks to which the Group are exposed to within its hedge accounting relationships and that are 
subject to interest rate benchmark reform are LIBOR and EURIBOR. These exposures relate to the hedge of the £375 million private 
placement (2019) and £98 million of the new infrastructure term loan facilities using a floating-to-fixed LIBOR interest rate swap. 
Also, €95 million of the new infrastructure term loan facilities are hedged using floating-to-fixed EURIBOR cross-currency interest 
rate swaps.
The Group is closely monitoring the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to 
new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by LIBOR regulators (including the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA)) regarding the transition away from LIBOR to Sterling Overnight Index Average Rate (SONIA). The FCA has made clear that,  
at the end of 2021, it will no longer seek to persuade, or compel, banks to submit to LIBOR.

7.2 Financial risk management continued
In response to the announcements, the Group will be engaging the following work streams: risk management, tax, treasury, legal 
and accounting. The aim of the programme is to identify any LIBOR exposures that are within the business and prepare and deliver 
on an action plan to enable a smooth transition to alternative benchmark rates. This will involve considering appropriate alternative 
benchmark rates in line with those proposed by different working groups in the industry and engaging with counterparties to 
implement appropriate wording in relevant contracts.
The Group has not early adopted phase 2 of interest rate benchmark reform, as it has not currently replaced its existing interest 
rate benchmarks.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
financial instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the 
liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of a reasonably possible increase/
decrease in interest rates. The analysis assumes all other variables were held constant.

Profit after tax is sensitive to an increase/decrease in interest rates as a result of the impact on the interest payable in the period on 
any floating rate debt. The Group has reduced its exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt through the use of floating-to-
fixed interest rate swaps and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on profit after tax. The Group 
designates certain floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such, other 
components of equity are sensitive to an increase/decrease in interest rates in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these 
movements.
Certain of the Group’s variable rate debt and interest rate swaps have a floor of 0% for the benchmark interest rate. As a result of 
very low or negative benchmark interest rates, a 100 basis points increase has a much larger impact on profit after tax and other 
components of equity, than a 100 basis points decrease. Additionally, the group has hedges in place for debt that is committed  
but not yet drawn. As a result a change in basis points has a larger impact on the profit after tax than the variable rate debt due  
to the impact of the undrawn borrowings not being included. The undrawn borrowings were drawn down on 18 February 2021 and  
if the impact of these undrawn borrowings on profit after tax was included at the year end, the impact of the variable rate debt  
and interest rate swaps would have offset.
Interest rate risk management
The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to interest rate risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, the 
use of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast interest rate exposure.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps and the floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps  
as hedging instruments against interest rate risk. The GBP interest rate swaps are hedges of the interest payments relating to the 
£375 million private placement (2019) and the £98 million of facilities (£53 million drawn, £45 million committed) as part of the new 
infrastructure term loan. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
relating to the €95 million of committed infrastructure term loan facilities. As such this has been separated into synthetic floating-
to-floating cross-currency interest rate swaps and synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps. The synthetic floating-to-
floating cross-currency interest rate swaps swap the €95 million variable rate EURIBOR linked debt to variable rate LIBOR linked 
GBP debt with a principal of £85.8m. The synthetic floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps then swaps this for a fixed GBP 
interest rate. Details of the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swaps are included in the disclosures below.
Gains and losses on the interest payments on interest rate swaps are released to interest payable and similar charges at the same 
time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. 
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to interest rate risk hedges are differences in the critical terms, differences in 
repricing dates and credit risk.

7.2.4 Inflation risk
The Group is exposed to inflation risk on elements of its revenues and cost base. The Group’s ROC revenues are linked to UK RPI and 
its Contract for Difference revenue is linked to UK CPI. In addition, a proportion of the Group’s fuel costs are linked to US/CAD CPI. 
The Group has entered UK and US CPI swaps to hedge the future cashflows relating to a proportion of its exposure. The Group also 
benefits from a natural hedge arising from its inflation-linked borrowings (see note 4.3).
Inflation risk sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to inflation rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date.
The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of a reasonably possible increase/
decrease in inflation rates. The analysis assumes all other variables were held constant.

15.5
The Group designates the UK CPI inflation swaps as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such, other 
components of equity are sensitive to an increase/decrease in UK inflation rates in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve  
of these movements. The sensitivities in the current year have a much smaller impact on equity than in the prior year due to the 
Group crystalising gains on £235 million out of the £250 million notional that was initially hedged. Profit after tax is sensitive to an 
increase/decrease in UK inflation rates due to the impact these rate changes would have on the amount reclassified to the income 
statement. Profit after tax is sensitive to an increase/decrease in US inflation rates due to the impact this would have on the fair 
value of the unhedged US inflation swap.
Inflation risk management
The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to inflation risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, the use  
of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast inflation exposure.
Hedge accounting
As the Group has contracts for which the revenue is contractually linked to UK CPI inflation, the Group has been able to designate 
this risk component as a hedged item. UK CPI inflation swaps are utilised as the hedging instrument for this inflation risk.
Gains and losses on the inflation swaps are held in the hedge reserve and reclassified to the income statement within the revenue 
line at the same time the revenue from the inflation linked contracts impacts on the income statement.
During the year the Group crystalised the gains on a number of UK inflation swaps. The forecast cash flows that these inflation 
swaps were hedging are still expected to occur. Therefore the gain of £24.4 million that has been crystalised relating to these 
contracts has been deferred in the hedge reserve and will be reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item impacts 
the income statement.

7.2.5 Liquidity risk
The Treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board. 
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group 
maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient 
funding for business requirements.
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items 
(principally those related to ROC sales and Customers power sales). In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis and 
accordingly, the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. The Group also utilises 
standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on time. The impact on the Group’s 
cash flows is described in note 4.4.

The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on the Group’s borrowings was 3.88% (2019: 3.99%).
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial liabilities which are marked-to-
market based on the undiscounted cash flows. Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has 
been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or 
other forward curves existing at the reporting date. Where derivatives are expected to be gross settled the gross cash flows have 
been presented. Commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts are expected to be gross settled. Where 
derivatives are expected to be net settled, the net cash flows expected to occur based on the current fair value have been 
disclosed. Financial contracts and other foreign exchange contracts (excluding forwards) are expected to be net settled. Interest 
rate contracts and inflation rate contracts are presented based on net settlement of the interest rate and inflation rate 
differentials. Gross settlement of the principal of cross-currency interest rate swaps is expected and as such this element of the 
swap is presented gross.

7.2.6 Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of currency, sustainable biomass and other goods 
and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial 
difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost 
goods or services from other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of power to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these 
counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the 
Group.
7.2.7 Credit risk
The Group’s gross exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, 
as summarised below:

Of the Group‘s three operating segments, the Generation and Customers segments are exposed to different levels and 
concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production 
segment only trades intra-group.
The highest risk is in the Customers segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets.  
In particular, its SME customers carry lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk, owing to a customer base comprised 
largely of smaller retail and commercial entities.
In the Customers segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before 
commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. The Customers 
segment extended its trade credit insurance programme in the prior year to increase its mitigation to credit risk.
For the Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as the sale of by-
products from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by 
category of credit rating. Counterparty credit exposures are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements 
to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group 
employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, 
cash collateral, letters of credit and surety bonds. The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in 
related energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased 
credit default swaps.
Further details on the impact of credit risk on trade and other receivables is disclosed in note 3.6. 
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that 
funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value 
of those funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating 
requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty based on their rating, and the maturity profile. 
Whilst cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was 
immaterial.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on derivative contracts, but to which the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are not applied. 
The carrying amount of these financial assets, disclosed above, represents the Group’s maximum credit risk exposure. 
Capital management
The Group is disciplined in its management of capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern; maintain a strong credit 
rating underpinned by robust financial metrics; invest in its core business and pay a sustainable and growing dividend while 
maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of 
borrowings and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 4.3 and 4.2 respectively.

7.3 Hedge reserve
The Group designates certain hedging instruments that are used to address commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and inflation rate risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument 
and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an 
ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting 
changes in cash flows of the hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are 
recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.
The tables below detail of the gains/(losses) recognised in the year on hedging instruments, the amounts reclassified from equity 
due to the hedged item affecting profit or loss, and the amounts reclassified due to the hedged future cash flows no longer being 
expected to occur. See section 7.2. for further details on these amounts.

7.4 Cost of hedging reserve
The Group allocates unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of foreign currency derivative contracts to a cost of hedging 
reserve in accordance with IFRS 9.
A large proportion of the derivative contracts held relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and 
swaps. Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s 
cash flow hedge relationships. The Group designates the cost of hedging – being the change in fair value associated with forward 
points including currency basis – to equity. All amounts within the cost of hedging reserve relate to foreign currency exchange risk.

7.5 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where the Group has a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. The Group also has financial asset and liabilities with certain counterparties that are subject to master 
netting agreements. Financial assets and liabilities do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet, but are subject to  
an enforceable master netting agreement that in certain circumstances, such as a bankruptcy, would allow for the amounts to  
be offset and a single net amount payable.
The table below shows the impact if the carrying amounts that are subject to these agreements were offset.

7.6 Contingent assets and liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of  
the Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a 
number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2020, the 
Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the RCF amounted to £67.9 million (2019: £77.0 million).
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £86.7 million (2019: 
£96.1 million).
7.7 Commitments
The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are 
not recorded in the balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future 
purchase of coal and biomass, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily  
for the delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2021–2027 
and the delivery of gas to be used in the Gas-thermal plants. To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, 
they are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing to them not being within the scope of IFRS 9 and therefore not 
required to be measured at fair value (see note 7.1).
226 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2020
This section details reference information relevant to the compiling of the financial statements and provides the general 
information about the Group (e.g. operations and registered office). The Group also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts 
and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.
8.1 General information
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together, the Group) have three principal activities:
• Power generation;
• Gas and electricity supply to business customers; and
• Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US.
The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, 
United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial 
statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
8.2 Basis of preparation
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2020. The Group adopted the following from 
1 January 2020:
IFRS 3 (amended) – Business Combinations – effective from 1 January 2020
IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 (amended) Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors – effective from 1 January 2020
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (amended) – effective from 1 January 2020
These updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
In 2019 the Group elected to early adopt the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’ issued in 
September 2019. These amendments were therefore first reflected in the Group’s Annual Consolidated Financial Statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2019.
The amendments are relevant to the Group given that it applies hedge accounting to its GBP LIBOR interest rate exposure  
on the £375 million private placement that is hedged using the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap, and the £98m of new 
infrastructure term loan facilities. The amendments are also relevant to the Group’s EURIBOR exposure on the €95 million  
of new infrastructure term loan facilities. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending 
endorsement by the EU – marked by *):
IFRS 16 (amended) – Covid-19 related Rent Concessions – effective for periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020
IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts – effective from 1 January 2021*
IFRS 3 (amended) – Reference to the Conceptual Framework – effective from 1 January 2022*
IAS 16 (amended) – Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds before Intended Use – effective from 1 January 2022*
IAS 37 (amended) – Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract – effective from 1 January 2022*
Annual Improvements 2018-2020 Cycle – effective from 1 January 2022*
IAS 1 (amended) – Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current – effective from 1 January 2023*
IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
(2011) – effective date deferred indefinitely*
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of 
the Group. The Group will continue to monitor the developments of these new or amended standards as and when they are 
endorsed for use in the United Kingdom from 1 January 2021.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC).
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
The Company applied certain new and amended standards for the first time in 2020. The full list of standards adopted is set out in 
the consolidated financial statements in note 8.2. These updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Company.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in  
relation to presentation of a cash flow statement, financial instruments, share-based payments, capital risk management, 
standards not yet effective and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the 
consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted  
are summarised below and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Investment in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where relevant, provision for impairment.
Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records amounts by which the proceeds from issuing shares 
exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 are met, in which case 
the difference is recorded in retained earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies
The critical accounting judgements made in preparation of the Company’s financial statements are set out below:
Impairment of fixed asset investments
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimates of the investments’  
values in use. The methodology for calculation of value in use is consistent with that of the Group, as detailed in note 2.4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
There were no areas of significant estimation uncertainty within these accounts. 
4. Profit and loss account
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. The Company’s profit and loss account was approved by the Board on 24 February 2021. The net profit attributable to 
the Company is £68.0 million.
The Company received dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings totalling £70.0 million in 2020 (2019: £60.5 million).
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and a 
proportion was recharged to the Company.

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 11 16⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. 
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Issued under employee share schemes
From January to December 2020 a total of 373,203 shares (2019: 3,282,563 shares) were issued in satisfaction of options vesting  
in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan.
The total cash received, split between nominal value and share premium, is shown in the statement of changes in equity on 
page 157.
Full details of share options outstanding are included in note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
7. Distributable reserves
The Company considers its distributable reserves to be comprised of the profit and loss account, less credits in respect of share 
schemes, less treasury shares, with a total value of £191.5 million. Accordingly, the Company considers itself to have sufficient 
distributable profits from which to pay the current year final dividend of £41 million. Based on a total dividend for 2020 of £68 
million, the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay two years of dividend at the current level without generating 
further distributable profits. In addition to its own reserves, the Company has access to the distributable reserves of its subsidiary 
undertakings with which future dividend payments can be funded (see note 2.10 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information).
The Company is dependent upon its subsidiaries for the provision of cash with which to make dividend payments. The Group  
has sufficient cash resources with which to meet the proposed dividend (see note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements for 
additional information).

Drax shareholder queries
The Company’s share register is maintained by Equiniti Limited (“Equiniti”), who is primarily responsible for updating the share 
register and for dividend payments.
Shareholders should contact Equiniti directly if they have a query relating to their Drax shareholding, in particular queries 
regarding:
• transfer of shares;
• change of name or address;
• lost share certificates;
• lost or out-of-date dividend cheques;
• payment of dividends direct to a bank or building society account; and
• death of a registered shareholder.
Equiniti can be contacted as follows:
• Call Equiniti on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK. Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday,

• Write to Equiniti at Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA.
When contacting Equiniti by telephone or in writing it is advisable to have your shareholder reference to hand and quote Drax 
Group plc, as well as the name and address in which the shares are held.

The registration process is easy via Equiniti’s secure website www.shareview.co.uk.
Once registered with Shareview you are able to:
• elect how Drax communicates with you;
• amend some of your personal details;

to offer a range of services and tailor the communications to meet your needs.
A range of frequently asked shareholder questions can also be found on our website at www.drax.com/investors/faq.
Tax on dividends
The way that dividends are taxed changed in 2017. Below is a brief summary of the guidance provided by HMRC as it relates to the 
current tax year. If you are in any doubt as to the impact on your personal circumstances, you are recommended to seek your own 
financial advice from a professional adviser authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
There is a tax-free Dividend Allowance of £2,000 per annum in the 2020-2021 tax year (2019-2020: £2,000) This means that there 
is no tax to pay on the first £2,000 of dividend income, no matter what non-dividend income a shareholder may have. Dividends 
paid on shares held within pensions and ISAs are unaffected and remain tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income of more than £2,001 but less than £10,000 are required to 
notify HMRC that they have this source of income. 
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income of more than £10,001 are required to file a self-assessment 
return with HMRC. 
The above requirements apply to Share Incentive Plan participants receiving cash dividends on their plan shares.
Further information and updates on tax on dividends can be found on the Gov.UK website at www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends

Shareholder information
Beneficial owners and “information rights”
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, 
receive information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. In order for this to happen, you must contact the third 
party registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications by beneficial owners of shares where the shares are held 
by third party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder and not to Drax or Equiniti.
ShareGift
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing to 
dispose charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no capital 
gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. Further 
information can be obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org.
Share frauds (“boiler room scams”)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message in 
the correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. At the time of this 
report, the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such as those outlined are 
usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. Below is the advice from the Financial Conduct Authority 
(the “FCA”).
Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you 
buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud:
• Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
• Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
• Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
• Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
• Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
• Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
• Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.
• Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
• Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you 
can find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
