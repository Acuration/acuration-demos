Biomass Strategy Update
27 February 2020
25
Biomass Strategy
Ensure the long-term future of biomass power generation through world leading safety and 
sustainability, ongoing cost reduction and the delivery of negative emissions
Ambition: to create the world’s largest, 
low-cost sustainable biomass supply chain
Increase self-supply         
to 5mt
Optimisation and 
trading of biomass 
supply
World leading 
sustainability policy
Development of 
carbon negative 
technology
Reduce biomass self-supply 
cost to £50/MWh(1) by 2027
1)
From c.£75/MWh in 2018 to £50/MWh, assuming a constant FX rate of $1.45/£ and 5Mt pa by 2027. Interim target from established projects of £13/MWh on 1.85Mt by 2022
Biomass Cost Reduction Route
27 February 2020

Increased control of supply chain to reduce overall cost of biomass generation to c.£50/MWh(1)
Initiatives
2019
2027
Opportunities from existing self-supply business
-
Established programme of improvements and expansion to deliver £13/MWh(1) savings on 
1.85Mt by 2022
-
$30m run rate savings in 2020, rising to $60m pa in 2022 vs 2018 base
Expansion of self-supply to deliver 5Mt of capacity
-
Satellite pellet plants in US south – lower cost fibre and processing cost
-
Opportunity for up to 0.5mt
-
c.40kt sites, c.$10-15m per site
-
Potential to replicate in other geographies
-
Evaluating other opportunities
Expansion of fuel envelope – viable fuels 
-
Developing and scaling low-cost alternative biomass in multiple geographies
-
For example, bagasse (sugarcane residue) – potential for > 1Mt pa
