1 Methodology context  
The purpose of this methodology is to show how a project proponent (defined in chapter 2) may quantify 
its net contribution to climate change mitigation. Such proponents will be using power and/or heat 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) as a tool for permanent carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR). This methodology is built on the principle of conservativeness, calculating the net volume of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) removed from the atmosphere through BECCS, and containing measures to avoid 
overstating removals volumes. In addition, this methodology outlines robust quantification approaches 
and data sources that can be used to verify net removal volumes and in turn produce CDR credits. It also 
outlines strict eligibility criteria, such as detailed biomass sustainability requirements. 
BECCS technology performs the service of capturing CO2 and permanently storing it in geological 
reservoirs. The capture and permanent storage of CO2 from sustainably sourced biomass delivers 
permanent negative emissions. This methodology applies to BECCS projects using thermal combustion 
of solid biomass fuels, i.e. those projects generating CDR credits from energy-generation BECCS plants. 
It does not apply to other BECCS approaches, such as ethanol-production or waste-to-energy plants – 
although many of the principles may also be adapted for use with these technologies. 
This methodology lays out criteria and approaches that project developers shall adhere to in each step 
of developing a credit-generating BECCS project. The authors anticipate that it will be updated 
periodically to reflect the latest approaches and evidence. 
The following documents have informed the development of the methodology:

and Storage

1.1 Version notes 
This version of the methodology (v0.9) has been developed by Drax and Stockholm Exergi, with technical 
inputs from EcoEngineers.  It is pending validation by a third party validation and verification body.   
 
 
 
5  
 
 
The methodology may be revised in future iterations to, inter alia, reflect new best practices or 
accommodate other project types (e.g. BECCS from the pulp and paper industry), fuel sources or 
jurisdictions.  
 
 
 
 
 
6  
 
 
2 Project requirements  
This chapter lays out the scope of this methodology, as well as the applicability conditions, safeguards 
and crediting periods that the project proponent is required to follow.  
2.1 Methodology scope  
The current version of this methodology applies to power and/or heat BECCS projects storing CO2 in a 
defined set of jurisdictions. These are: the European Union (EU) and non-EU member states of the 
European Economic Area (EEA), the United States of America (USA), or the United Kingdom (UK). This 
jurisdictional limitation is based on  said jurisdictions’ robust regulations and high enforcement levels, in 
particular regarding permanent geological sequestration of carbon dioxide. This is not to say that other 
jurisdictions may not already have equally strong regulatory frameworks; in future iterations, the 
methodology’s scope may be opened to more jurisdictions.  
The methodology only applies to forest and agricultural biomass1, although it may be extended to other 
forms of biomass in the future. Projects may source biomass from any jurisdiction / source which meets 
the sustainable biomass criteria outlined in Appendix C.   
2.2 Project proponent  
The project proponent is defined as the party that has the overall contractual control over, and 
responsibility for, the BECCS project that generates CDR credits. Typically, this is the operator or owner 
of the carbon capture system. The project proponent is not required to directly operate all components 
of the BECCS value chain, and may choose to rely on contractual partnerships for delivery. For example, 
the project proponent need not be the entity which directly injects or stores the CO2. The project 
proponent shall be the sole beneficiary of any carbon credits generated in relation to activities using this 
methodology. 
2.3 Requirements 
Applicability conditions 
The project proponent shall demonstrate that their project:  
a. Uses only sustainable biomass feedstocks, verified appropriately against the conditions laid out in 
Appendix C of this methodology.  
b. Stores captured CO2 in geological storage only with storage operators that meet local and 
international applicable regulatory standards for permanent sequestration. Storage sites are to be 
verified appropriately against the conditions regarding permanence laid out in chapter 8.  
 
1  Note that Appendix C on sustainable biomass criteria currently only applies to forest biomass. A version of this appendix for 
agricultural biomass is in development.  
 
 
 
7  
 
 
c. CO2 captured through BECCS facilities cannot be used for purposes other than permanent storage, 
including enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR).2  
Safeguards 
The aim of projects under this methodology is to deliver climate change mitigation through the delivery 
of CDR. While this delivers a climate benefit, it is important to also consider the social and environmental 
impact on communities where projects are located. Therefore, at project validation, the project 
proponent shall demonstrate that their project has:  
a. Conducted all relevant stakeholder consultations following the requirements described in Appendix 
E. 
b. Reviewed the full list of safeguards outlined in Appendix F and either i) confirmed they have not 
identified any project risk of breaching any of these, or ii) provided a mitigation plan for any identified 
risks. These assessments shall be made available on request to the validation/verification bodies 
(VVB) engaged to validate the project. If any issues arise against these safeguards during project 
operation, the project proponent must develop and publish a mitigation plan. 
Crediting periods  
The project crediting period runs for 15 years and is renewable twice. Each renewal period will require a 
full review and update of the Project Design Document (PDD – see chapter 9) to ensure continued 
compliance with all methodology requirements. Renewals will be validated against the latest version of 
the methodology document, noting that the methodology requirements may be updated over time. 
 
 
2  In many cases, BECCS projects are likely to use shared infrastructure for CO2 transport, injection, or storage with other CO2 
capture projects. Shared infrastructure may also be used for non-applicable activities such as enhanced hydrocarbon recovery 
(EHR). In the case that a BECCS project uses shared infrastructure where a part of the overall CO2 is going to EHR, the project 
developer shall demonstrate that contractually their CO2 is only intended for applicable non-EHR storage sites. Furthermore, 
the developer shall provide mass balance evidence from the infrastructure provider that the amount of CO2 the developer is 
entitled to was injected in an applicable non-EHR storage site. 
 
 
 
8  
 
 
3 Project boundaries 
The project’s boundaries are defined both in terms of spatial extent and in terms of relevant project 
activities leading to carbon sources and sinks. The boundary is drawn to represent processes that are 
exclusively initiated by the anticipation of CDR credit revenue from the project. (See Appendix G for a 
detailed list of emissions included or excluded from the project boundary.)  
The spatial extent of the project boundary encompasses: 
• 
The physical, geographical sites where CO2 associated with bioenergy is captured by the project. 
• 
The sites where the captured CO2 is processed. 
• 
The sites where the processed CO2 is compressed and dehydrated. 
• 
The docking sites of the CO2 transport system. 
• 
The sites where CO2 is injected for storage. 
• 
The secure underground geological reservoirs where the injected CO2 is stored.3 
Furthermore, to ensure a conservative calculation of net removals, this methodology requires the 
quantification and deduction of both operational supply chain emissions and leakage generated in the 
BECCS value chain. By subtracting emissions generated along the value chain, this approach ensures that 
only net removals are credited (elaborated in chapter 7). 
3.1 Requirements 
3.1.1 
The formal project boundary shall be drawn around the carbon capture, processing, transport 
and storage components of the BECCS system (see figure 1). 
3.1.2 
The project proponent must provide the locations of each project site using global positioning 
system (GPS) coordinates. If pipelines are included in the CO2 transport process, then the project 
proponent shall provide a map showing the GPS coordinates for locations along the pipeline.  
 
 
3  As adapted from Gold Standard – Methodology for biomass fermentation with carbon capture and geologic storage – draft 
for public consultation (2023). Note that in cases where projects are connected to complex networks with multiple and 
evolving CO2 capture, processing and storage sites, the project boundary would be defined in contractual terms rather than 
spatial ones for simplicity, for example as the contractual destination of CO2.

Figure 1 Extent of BECCS project  
A BECCS project's boundary encompasses all activities initiated by the anticipation of CDR credit revenues: namely carbon capture, processing, transport, and 
injection and storage processes. Emissions that would have occurred anyway, absent the BECCS project, are considered baseline emissions, and are excluded 
from the net removals calculation - as described in chapter 5. For conservativeness, the quantification of net removals accounts for a broader range of activities 
beyond those strictly within project boundaries: namely operational supply chain emissions and leakages (i.e. indirect emissions), which are deducted from 
gross CO2 injected. Note that some market leakages may reduce emissions (e.g. through heat recovery processes on carbon capture units). These concepts are 
further discussed in chapters 6 and 7.

4 Additionality  
Under this methodology, BECCS projects are developed for the purpose of delivering carbon removals. 
Removals are additional if they would not have taken place without the incentive created by CDR credit 
revenues. Note that the additionality assessment described in this methodology is designed to follow a 
‘standardized approach’ as defined by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM). 
4.1 Requirements  
4.1.1 
The project proponent shall demonstrate the additionality of their BECCS project by following 
the approach outlined in figure 2 below: 
 
 
Figure 2 Additionality demonstration diagram 
1. Regulatory requirement: The project proponent shall demonstrate that there are no existing 
regulations requiring the proponent to capture and store CO2 on bioenergy plants within the 
jurisdiction of the capture unit. Where successfully demonstrated, projects are considered to comply 
with this requirement for the duration of their crediting period upon validation. This will be 
 
 
 
11  
 
 
revalidated at each crediting period renewal. If the project is able to demonstrate regulatory 
additionality, it must move to additionality step 2.  
2. Prior consideration of carbon market revenues: The project proponent must provide documented 
evidence (e.g. public announcements, internal decision documents) of ‘prior consideration’4 of 
carbon market revenues in the decision to develop a project. ‘Prior consideration’ is defined as 
reasoning used to justify action or investment in advance of operational commencement. If the 
project proponent can prove prior consideration, it must move to step 3.  
3. Private sector support: A project may receive funds from the private sector, other than those from 
sales of CDR credits or equity funding. Such funding may include grants, prize money and other non-
credit related contributions. If this is the case, the project will need to demonstrate additionality 
using step 6. If the project has no such funds, it must move to step 4.  
4. Government/institutional support: If a project proponent demonstrates that the project is not in 
receipt of sources of revenue from governments or public institutions, the project is additional. In 
cases where there is government / institutional support, the project must move to step 5.  
5. Government support envisages VCM participation: Government or institutional support may take 
several forms. Often support is granted with the assumption that the project will participate in the 
voluntary carbon market (VCM) and therefore that some portion of the project funding will come 
from the market. If a government envisages that the project will participate in the VCM, the project 
will be additional, since without the incentive created by CDR credit revenues it would not have 
received government aid, and therefore would not have taken place. Projects in receipt of 
government or institutional support that do not envisage VCM participation must move to step 6. 
6. Auditor Financial Statement: To confirm that projects receiving private sector, government or 
institutional support would not have taken place absent the incentive of carbon market revenues, a 
third-party financial auditor will review the finances of activities within the project boundary. The 
auditor will determine whether said revenues were a necessary factor in the project proponent’s 
decision to initiate the project. If the auditor states that carbon market revenue is necessary, then the 
project is additional.

5 Baseline determination and quantification 
5.1 Defining the baseline 
A project baseline describes what would have happened in the absence of a carbon removals project. 
Under this methodology, the baseline comprises activities in the BECCS process not encompassed in the 
project boundary. There are two possible baseline scenarios applicable under this methodology: 
• 
Scenario A – retrofit BECCS. The project enables the installing and/or operating of new carbon 
capture equipment on an existing biomass power and/or heat plant.  
• 
Scenario B – new-build BECCS. The project enables the installing and/or operating of carbon 
capture equipment on a new biomass power and/or heat plant.  
 
Under this methodology, retrofit refers to the introduction of new materials, products and technologies 
into an existing bioenergy plant to operate as a carbon capture and storage facility. To qualify as an 
existing biomass power and/or heat plant, it shall have been operational for more than 48 months before 
the installation of the new materials. 
Projects where CCS equipment has been installed on a bioenergy power and/or heat plant less than or 
equal to 48 months from the operational start date of the plant shall be considered newbuild. 
Projects where CCS equipment has been installed on a bioenergy power and/or heat plant more than 48 
months from the operational start date of the plant shall be considered retrofit.5 
Under both scenarios, transport and storage does not necessarily have to be at the capture location, and 
can be either retrofit or new-build. For both scenarios, the baseline has been designed to be conservative 
with respect to quantifying net removals. Examples of why the approach is conservative include:  
Scenario A – retrofit BECCS: 
• 
A part of operational supply chain emissions is allocated to carbon removals, even though an 
argument could be made that these emissions would have occurred in any case. 
• 
Energy leakage must be accounted for and subtracted from gross removals, even though the 
overall system is a net renewable producer. 
Scenario B – new-build BECCS: 
• 
The embodied emissions from the construction of the energy plant must be subtracted from net 
removals, even though an argument could be made for allocating these emissions to energy. 
 
5  Note that in a scenario in which an energy plant is transformed from using fossil fuels to biomass fuel sources, the decision 
of whether the BECCS project is new-build or retrofit depends only on the time between the completion of the bioenergy 
conversion and the completion of CCS installation. For example, a CCS unit that is installed within 48 months of a plant being 
successfully converted from fossil fuel to biomass usage would be considered a new-build BECCS project, regardless of the 
time spent on converting the plant. 
 
 
 
13  
 
 
• 
Any additional avoided emissions resulting from the renewable energy displacement of more 
carbon intensive forms of generation is not included in the quantification. 
The impact of the different scenarios on quantification is summarized in figure 3 below.  
 
5.2 Requirements 
5.2.1 
Any emissions not attributable to the project shall be categorized as baseline emissions (see 
description of applicable emissions in Appendix G). These shall not be considered in the net 
removals calculation (see chapter 7).  
5.2.2 
At point of project validation, the project proponent shall confirm whether the project shall be 
considered as a retrofit (Scenario A) or new-build (Scenario B). They should use the definitions in 
section 5.1 of this methodology. 
5.2.3 
In either baseline scenario (A or B), if the project developer provides evidence that the underlying 
biomass power and/or heat plant would generate power / heat even in the absence of CDR 
generation, a proportion of operational supply chain emissions may be allocated to baseline 
emissions using an allocation factor (further described in chapter 7).

6 Leakage 
BECCS projects may lead to indirect emissions or ‘leakage’ caused by activities within the BECCS value 
chain (including biomass production, processing, capture, transport and storage activities). This 
methodology accounts for all material leakage emissions by subtracting them from gross CO2 removed.  
6.1 Requirements 
6.1.1 
A project proponent must assess all sources of leakage across four categories of leakage6, as 
outlined in table 1 below.  
Table 1 Categories of emissions leakage 
Source of leakage 
Materiality 
Upstream/downstream emissions: removals can 
directly impact emissions that occur downstream 
or upstream, outside of net removals 
quantification boundaries. For example, if BECCS 
was to increase emissions intensity in upstream 
forestry (e.g. by requiring more emissions 
intensive equipment) or lead to embodied carbon 
from the development of non-project specific CO2 
pipeline and storage infrastructure due to the 
additional demand for such services.  
To be assessed through direct quantification of key 
upstream/downstream emissions sources outside 
of project boundaries likely to increase due to 
project activity. 
Activity-shifting: shifting emissions to locations 
not targeted, or emissions not monitored, by the 
activity. An example is the increase in agricultural 
emissions from the displacement of agricultural 
activities from land preferred for biomass 
production. 
Assessed to be non-material due to the stringent 
biomass sustainability requirements of this 
methodology. In particular, due to the following 
protections against land sector leakage: 
• 
Biomass feedstock shall not use feedstock 
suitable for use in long-lived wood 
products. These sources of fibre are of 
greatest value and therefore provide the 
main driver of land use and land 
management decisions in the forest sector  
• 
Biomass feedstock is only sourced from 
forest areas where the carbon stock is 
stable or increasing, or where biomass 
sourcing helps to reverse declines in forest 
carbon stock (e.g. to mitigate risk of natural 
disturbance). By assessing carbon stock 
changes at a jurisdictional or sourcing area

procedure, July 2023 
 
 
 
15  
 
 
Source of leakage 
Materiality 
level, the assessment captures both direct 
and indirect forest carbon stock changes 
associated with the project. (See Appendix 
C) 
Market leakage: removals can impact the supply 
and demand of emissions-intensive products or 
services. For example, energy leakage would occur 
if the installation of CCS equipment raises demand 
for carbon intensive energy.  
To be assessed following approach outlined in 
Appendix D.  
Note that energy leakage emissions are distinct 
from direct CCS energy use emissions, which are 
accounted for in the net removals quantification 
under CCS project emissions. Energy leakage are 
indirect emissions that would be caused by 
changes to the overall grid’s emissions intensity 
resulting from CCS operations. 
Note: in some cases, there can be negative leakage 
(i.e. lowering of emissions) – for example through 
the recovery of process heat replacing other heat 
production. This benefit may be specified but, due 
to conservativeness, will only be entered into the 
net removals calculation when positive leakage 
occurs, i.e. increase in emissions due to leakage. 
Ecological leakage: a removals project can have 
an indirect impact on emissions from 
hydrologically-connected areas. An example would 
be carbon dioxide emissions from soils in a wetland 
if the water level is lowered following increases in 
water demand from biomass feedstocks grown on 
land that is hydrologically- connected to the 
wetland.  
Materiality to be assessed through an 
environmental impact assessment. 
6.1.2 
For upstream/downstream emissions leakage and ecological leakage, the project proponent 
shall include the following steps:  
a) List sources of potentially relevant emissions and quantification estimates for these. 
b) Identify those sources of emissions most likely to increase in response to BECCS deployment, 
with an estimated potential impact (expressed as the % increase of emissions from these 
sources, relative to baseline level).   
c) Quantify any emissions sources estimated to potentially have material impact (>2% of gross 
injected CO2) using a life cycle analysis (LCA) approach and add the value to the leakage 
calculation in the quantification chapter. 
6.1.3 
To ensure no activity-shifting leakage, including land sector leakage, the project proponent shall 
meet all sustainable biomass criteria laid out in Appendix C. 
 
 
 
16  
 
 
6.1.4 
To quantify energy leakage, a component of market leakage, the project proponent shall follow 
the process outlined in Appendix D. 
 
 
 
 
 
17  
 
 
7 GHG removal quantification 
This chapter details the method that the project proponent must follow to quantify the number of CDR 
credits they can receive from removing greenhouse gases (GHGs) through BECCS activity. This number 
is determined by the amount of CO2 that has been permanently removed and stored through the BECCS 
project, minus all direct emissions associated with CCS operation and supply chain emissions, and minus 
indirect emissions from leakage.  
Any emissions will be converted to CO2e using the most recently available IPCC criteria.7 
7.1 Requirements 
7.1.1 
The project proponent shall measure total CDR credits generated by BECCS using the approach 
outlined in figure 3 below and the subsections and equations that follow. These equations have 
been designed to capture a conservative estimate of the ‘net’ volume of removals produced by a 
BECCS project. 
7.1.2 
The full quantification shall be carried out at validation and applied at each subsequent 
verification and credit issuance. Not all variables need to be updated at each quantification - 
certain variables only need updating annually (with updates required for each calendar year after 
validation). Each data/parameter shall be monitored according to the frequency outlined in the 
sampling plan noted in the PDD (an example is shown in chapter 9).

Gross injected CO2 removals 
The preferred approach for quantifying injected CO2 removal volumes is through documentation from 
the storage operator that certifies the gross volumes of injected CO2 attributed to the BECCS project. If 
certification showing injected CO2 volumes directly attributable to the BECCS project is provided, this 
figure shall be used directly,8 and fugitive emissions need not be estimated.  
Where certification is not available (e.g. if a storage operator is unexpectedly unable to verify CO2 
allocations from multiple CCS plants that may be feeding into a single injection site), then equation 2 
shall be used to estimate gross injected removal volumes. Equation 2 relies on metering data from the 
capture facility for calculating carbon removals, not on data from the point of injection.

mitigation reporting uses. Where this is the case, the project proponent shall provide evidence to the VVB of the volume of 
removals being used for these different purposes, and these volumes shall be subtracted from gross injected removals prior 
to the rest of the calculation.

Project developers shall make transparent in their PDD an estimation of fugitive emissions from carbon 
transport and injection processes. They should also estimate the uncaptured emissions from the burning 
of ancillary fossil fuels (e.g. for starting up the biomass combustion process or use in regenerative thermal 
oxidisers). Developers should review these estimates in their annual reporting to ensure fugitive 
emissions are not underestimated. 
Operational supply chain emissions 
Operational supply chain emissions include all emissions related to the supply of biomass feedstock used 
for BECCS, which is the sum of: 
• 
Biomass cultivation and harvesting emissions 
• 
Processing emissions (for example, processing woody biomass into pellets) 
• 
Transport emissions from moving feedstock (the project proponent will need to acquire and hold 
data on all transportation methods, their emissions factors, and the distances travelled) 
• 
Emissions from removing and transporting the waste generated through bioenergy or carbon 
capture activities (for example, removing ash). 
For biomass cultivation and harvesting emissions, note that only those emissions directly attributable to 
the cultivation and harvesting of biomass for BECCS purposes (e.g., collection of residues) shall be 
included in this quantification – all other emissions shall be excluded as these should be allocated to the 
timber operator.9 The emissions associated with the collection, transport, and processing of the 
feedstock for BECCS shall, however, be included in the quantification. 
Operational supply chain emissions will also include emissions from energy generated onsite. Note that 
the sustainable biomass criteria of this methodology, particularly those on sourcing from stable or 
increasing forest carbon stocks, ensure that BECCS operations shall not cause emissions from direct land 
use changes.

Operational supply chain emissions can either be fully allocated to carbon removals or be partially 
allocated against different energy products that may be produced through the bioenergy generation 
process. The use of the allocation factor is left to the discretion of the project proponent. If project 
proponents wish to partially allocate operational supply chain emissions to other products (e.g. heat and 
electricity), the split of emissions between these products shall be conducted in accordance with the 
GHGP standard10 for the Allocation of GHG Emissions. For example, operational supply chain emissions 
can be allocated to all “products” indicated as arrows in the below diagram: 
Figure 5 Allocation of emissions to heat and electricity 
 
 
Project proponents shall calculate the allocation factor (AFy), i.e. the share of operational supply chain 
emissions allocated to the CCS product, by multiplying the share of electricity production within the 
plant’s total energy output (including electricity and heat) with the share of electricity used in CCS 
activities. Operational supply chain emissions may be ‘allocated’ to different products according to this 
ratio of energy output. To the extent operational supply chain emissions are not being applied to energy 
products, those emissions shall be fully allocated to the carbon removal product. For avoidance of doubt, 
all emissions associated with the electricity used for CO₂ capture and transportation preparation (i.e.

(2017)

electricity required for carbon capture, liquefaction and interim storage) shall be fully allocated to the 
carbon removal product. In order to apply a conservative approach, none of the operational supply chain 
emissions will be allocated to any potential heat product based on heat recovery from the carbon 
capture, the liquefaction or the interim storage. 
Project emissions from energy production 
Emissions from energy production will not include CO2 emissions from the combustion of sustainable 
biomass due to their 'zero rated’ nature (as detailed in Appendix A and Appendix C). However, 
combustion of biomass typically results in the production of CH4 and N2O, which shall be taken into 
account. This may also include emissions from managing any waste streams from the energy production 
activities.

The quantification shall subtract all emissions generated from the construction and operation of CCS 
equipment. This includes all emissions regarding the installation and operation of carbon capture 
processes, and  involves:  
• 
Emissions from the operation of the carbon capture process, including chemical use and 
production, and energy use. 
• 
Emissions for processing captured carbon (including liquefaction). 
• 
Emissions from transport of CO2 to injection and storge sites following the capture process (the 
project proponent will need to acquire and hold data on all transportation methods, their 
emissions factors, and the distances travelled).

Emissions generated from injection and storage processes (including from any energy used in 
pumping and maintaining the CO2 in its storage location).

BECCS, emissions from the construction of the bioenergy power and/or heat plant.11 
Any construction emissions directly attributable to the project (e.g. installation of CCS equipment or 
bioenergy plant construction emissions for new-build) shall be identified, included and amortised over 15 
years. This reflects the duration of one crediting period as described under clause 2.3.3 above. Once all 
embodied emissions have been amortized over the first crediting period, they shall not be included as 
project emissions in future periods.

Project emissions from capture 
In most cases, the energy required to operate CCS equipment will come through the biomass energy 
generation process. Any energy used for CCS from on-site biomass generation will not need to be 
subtracted from gross removals as all relevant emissions are factored into the supply chain emission and 
project emissions from energy production calculations. Potential secondary effects on the grid – for 
example, energy leakage – are considered further in equation 7 and Appendix D. 
In some cases, however, the carbon capture process may be powered by energy purchased from third 
party sources. In these cases, the carbon emissions from energy can be determined by multiplying the 
energy used to operate the CCS equipment by the most locally available grid emissions factor. In cases 
where the CCS equipment is operated using a dedicated generation facility, with energy provided directly 
 
11  This will also include the embodied emissions from any construction activity for transport, injection, or storage directly 
caused as a result of the BECCS project, for example CO2 pipelines or storage sites. Only construction activity for transport, 
injection, and storage infrastructure occurring as a direct result of the BECCS project shall be counted as embodied emissions 
in this calculation. Any indirect impacts, for example increased demand for shared CO2 storage sites, will be accounted for 
under the upstream/downstream leakage calculations as described in chapter 6.

to the CCS facility (e.g. by direct wire, or PPAs fulfilling strict temporal and geographical constraints12), 
then an emission factor specific to the carbon intensity of the generation facility may be used. Energy 
attribute certificates (EACs) shall not be used for conferring the carbon intensity of energy used by the 
plant.13  
Chemicals produced for use in the carbon capture process shall also have their upstream emissions 
quantified using supply chain-relevant and chemical-specific emissions factors. Chemicals used in the 
carbon capture process are also likely to contain embodied emissions that are then released through the 
CO2 capture process. These emissions shall also be quantified using chemical-specific emissions factors 
(which shall be defined in the PDD and revised periodically during full verification). In addition, some 
methods may release other GHGs due to chemical use, and these shall also be quantified with chemical-
specific emissions factors.

As discussed above, all material leakages shall be considered in the calculation of net emissions removals. 
Leakages should be assessed against the four main leakage types introduced above, and those with 
leakage values higher than a materiality threshold of >2% of gross captured emissions (GCEy) shall be 
subtracted from gross injected emissions (GIEy). Leakages shall be assessed using the framework 
described in chapter 6 and summed up as in the equation below. See also Appendix D for further details 
on estimation approaches for energy leakages, considered as a sub-set of the market leakage category 
below.

13  Note that regardless of the emissions associated with any energy ‘drawn-down’ from the grid, energy leakage risks shall 
continue to be assessed as described in equation 7 and Appendix D. In the case where renewable energy is drawn from the 
grid to power a CCS process, energy leakage remains. Energy has been removed from grid capacity, and so this capacity 
would need to be replaced to fill demand.

Adjustments 
Exception adjustments allow for reductions to the number of credits that may be issued in a given period. 
In the case where a project proponent fails to meet particular requirements within this methodology, 
(e.g. the failure of certain biomass consignments against the sustainability criteria in Appendix C), the 
project proponent, VVB, and registry may propose conservative compensation mechanisms. Exact 
agreement on these compensation adjustments will require adoption by the VVB and registry. Such 
exceptions shall be quantified and verified by the VVB against the terms of the methodology. 
Additional subtraction adjustments to gross removals may be added at the discretion of the project 
proponent.

8 Storage and permanence 
For CDR activities to have sustained impact on lowering atmospheric carbon, and so for carbon credits to 
be issued, storage of captured CO2 must be permanent with a risk of reversal scientifically determined to 
be negligible. This chapter outlines requirements for all storage operators used by a BECCS project, to 
ensure that CO2 is stored permanently, and with transparent reporting in place.  
8.1 Scientific and regulatory basis for permanent storage of carbon 
Subject to the requirements contained in this methodology, CO2 may be considered permanently stored 
from the point of injection into its geological reservoir given the negligible risk of reversal.14 This level of 
permanence risk has been assessed based on robust scientific evidence and regulatory conditions. 
Scientific risk of reversal  
• 
The IPCC special report on carbon dioxide capture and storage15 states that: ‘For large-scale 
operational CO2 storage projects, assuming that sites are well selected, designed, operated and 
appropriately monitored, the balance of available evidence suggests the following: It is very likely 
the fraction of stored CO2 retained is more than 99% over the first 100 years; It is likely the 
fraction of stored CO2 retained is more than 99% over the first 1000 years.’  
• 
Similarly, the containment certainty study regarding ‘Deep Geological Storage of CO2 on the UK 
Continental Shelf’16 confidently concluded that less than 0.01% of injected CO2 is likely to escape 
into the atmosphere for typical UK offshore sites with permitted storage complexes after 25 
years of injection and 100 years of storage17. The study was based on a review of close to 100 
studies and analysis of failure data from a global database of well equipment reliability. 
Regulatory conditions 
• 
As per the applicability criteria, the methodology applies only to sequestration occurring in the 
Member States of the European Union, non-EU Member States of the European Economic Area 
(EEA), the UK, and the USA.  These jurisdictions require having a permit that guarantees safe and 
permanent storage of carbon through appropriate site selection and characterization and the 
adoption of safe injection and storage methods. These regulations require storage operators to 
monitor stored carbon during and post injection, as well as after site closure, to ensure that leaks 
do not occur. In addition, storage operators must report monitoring results at least once a year 
in the EEA and UK, and semi-annually in the USA.  
 
14  Reversal refers to any migration of carbon dioxide from its geological reservoirs post injection. This is also sometimes known 
as ‘leakage’, so to avoid confusion with the notion of indirect emissions, this document only uses the term ‘reversal’.  
15  IPCC special report on carbon dioxide capture and storage – Chapter 5 Underground geological storage, p.246, 2005 
16  BEIS Deep Geological Storage of CO2 on the UK Continental Shelf - Containment Certainty, p.9, 2023 
17  Probability across 125 years 
 
 
 
27  
 
• 
In these jurisdictions, permanence is further strengthened by the transfer of responsibilities to 
government following site closure. In the EEA and the UK, once all evidence demonstrates that 
stored carbon will be completely and permanently contained, operational and financial 
obligations pertaining to storage site maintenance, monitoring and implementation of 
corrective measures are transferred from the operator to the relevant competent authority. In 
the USA, transfer provisions are defined at the state level. As an example, in Louisiana18, 
ownership of the storage facility is transferred to the state by default 50 years after the end of 
injection operations if carbon sequestration is shown to be safe and permanent.   
• 
In the event of emissions released from the storage site, the storage operator will be required to 
take different mitigation measures depending on local regulations. These regulations, including 
the risk of having the license revoked, create strong incentives for the storage operator to 
operate the site in line with industry standards. For example: 
o If carbon dioxide stored migrates from its geological reservoir to the atmosphere, 
storage operators in the EEA must surrender ETS emissions allowances (EUA). A similar 
approach exists in the UK. This ensures that net emissions in the system do not change 
as a result of the project. 
o In the USA, remediation mechanisms are defined at the federal and state levels. At the 
federal level, EPA Class VI rules do not target emissions from leaks specifically but require 
storage operators to have an emergency remediation plan and to take corrective action 
to prevent dangerous movements of carbon underground. Storage operators may also 
lose access to government subsidies if carbon is not stored permanently. For example, 
benefits from USA’s tax credit on carbon sequestration 45Q19 will be ‘recaptured’ if the 
carbon ceases to be ‘disposed of in secure geological storage’. 
In future, this methodology may be extended to jurisdictions other than the EU, non-EU member states 
of the EEA, UK and USA if the project proponent can provide evidence that relevant local regulations 
meet or exceed the requirements set out in the ISO 27914:2017 standard on Carbon Dioxide Capture, 
Transportation and Geological Storage. 
8.2 Requirements 
In addition to adhering to relevant local regulations on the storage of CO2, the relevant party responsible 
for transport and storage of carbon shall provide evidence to the project proponent that they have carried 
out the below requirements: 
8.2.1 
Provide certificates of CO2 injection attributable to the project proponent to inform the net 
removal quantification described in chapter 7. 
8.2.2 
Store CO2 in geological storage sites within the list of jurisdictions detailed in Appendix B. 
 
18  Louisiana Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide act 2009 
19  US Code 45Q – credit for carbon oxide sequestration 2008 
 
 
 
28  
 
8.2.3 
Conduct a risk assessment prior to project implementation and produce a plan for monitoring 
reversals if this is not already required by relevant local regulations. 
8.2.4 
Adhere to ISO 9001 or 14033 or equivalent standard of procedure in relation to the management 
of data. 
Following these requirements, the relevant party will fulfil the permanence materiality assessment 
defined by criteria 9.1 c) in the ICVCM core carbon principles assessment framework.20 ICVCM criteria 9.1 
and 9.3 note that financial mechanisms to account for reversal risks, such as pooled buffer reserve or 
insurance, will not be required for projects with non-material risks of reversals. ICVCM notes that CCS 
projects with geological storage are likely to have non-material risk of reversal, and so unlikely to require 
financial mechanisms for mitigating reversal risks.

9 Reporting, validation and verification 
This chapter explains the reporting, validation and verification processes for BECCS projects. Reporting 
is defined as the submission of data and evidence to a third-party organisation (a VVB) for the purpose of 
independently assuring project outcomes. Validation is defined as the confirmation of a project’s 
adherence to all requirements in this methodology. Project validation also signifies the beginning of the 
crediting period. Verification is defined as the assurance of claims of net CO2 removal volumes that inform 
each credit issuance, following the quantification approach shown in chapter 7. 
9.1 Outline of reporting, validation and verification processes 
As described in 9.2, the project proponent is required to develop a Project Design Document (PDD) to 
describe all relevant technical components of a BECCS project. This PDD will be a ‘living document’ that 
will change over the life of the project. 
The project proponent may choose to validate their PDD before commencing any further project activity, 
such as the construction or installation of any carbon capture assets. PDD validation can give confidence 
that, should BECCS projects be developed according to the specifications of the PDD, their operations 
will be compliant with the requirements of this methodology. The PDD validation also gives the project 
proponent an opportunity to confirm additionality before construction.21 
A project proponent shall develop a monitoring plan within the PDD that describes how a project can 
provide evidence of compliance with all validation and verification requirements in this methodology. An 
independent VVB shall review this monitoring plan during PDD validation (or project validation, if PDD 
validation is not sought). The VVB may suggest edits to the reporting frequency of specific variables 
according to their best judgement on what is needed to determine high integrity BECCS removals. An 
indicative monitoring plan is shown in Annex J. 
An illustrative project timeline is shown in the table below, with validation and verification requirements 
for each stage shown in the appropriate column. Cells highlighted in blue represent formal reporting 
requirements as part of this methodology. Cells in white are included for information only, to describe 
how the project reporting processes may align with a typical BECCS project. Note: unless specifically 
detailed in the table below, VVBs will be required to assess data that the project proponent shares with 
them. Where more stringent validation or verification approaches are required (e.g. VVB site visits), these 
are noted in the table. 
 
21  Even if additionality is confirmed before the start of the project crediting period, this confirmation of additionality will apply 
for the full duration of the first crediting period once it begins.

validation and verification reports. This monitoring plan will outline the frequency for collecting, 
reporting on, and independently verifying data points. Monitoring plans shall show how the 
project proponent plans to provide data for all variables shown in the monitoring tables in 
Appendix I. 
9.2.3

sourcing areas, capture facilities and storage sites to assess compliance with the methodology’s 
sustainable biomass and storage and permanence requirements. The VVB may define the 
frequency and nature of such site visits, as well as any additional checks that are deemed 
necessary as part of project validation in the project data sampling and verification plan.  
9.2.6 
The project proponent may submit their PDD to the VVB ahead of project validation, to gain 
confidence that their operations will be compliant with the requirements of this methodology.  
 
Verification  
9.2.7 
At the point of project validation, full and streamlined verifications, and validation renewals, the 
project proponent shall provide the VVB with all data points necessary, as defined in the 
monitoring plan. 
9.2.8 
The project proponent shall submit a full verification report, as a minimum, once per year for 
each calendar year after the year of initial project validation. This full verification report shall 
provide updates to all quantification variables as described in the monitoring tables in Appendix 
I. In addition, VVBs shall conduct the following actions on the full verification report: 
a. Assess alignment of biomass sourcing sites with sustainable biomass sourcing requirements in 
Appendix C. 
b. Assess carbon capture site alignment with methodology requirements in chapter 2. 
c. Assess alignment of injection and storage sites with requirements shown in chapter 8.  
d. Confirm that project boundaries are accurate and relevant (as described in chapter 3). 
e. Review materiality assessments for leakages (see chapter 6) to ensure they are accurate, and 
review the accuracy of any leakage required to be quantified and subtracted from the net 
removal quantification. 
f. Validate that safeguard risks as detailed in Appendix F have been assessed, that risk assessments 
continue to be applicable, and that mitigation plans have been developed where necessary. 
 
 
 
37  
 
g. Disclosure of all areas of uncertainty. This may include any lapses in feedstock documentation, 
data irregularities, scientific uncertainty in LULUCF modelling for applicable regions, geological 
uncertainty involving formations or CO₂ plume modelling, and LCA considerations where 
subjective decisions were made regarding boundaries and exclusions of SSRs.  
h. Confirm the applicability of VVB credentials against the requirements of clause 9.2.13. 
 
9.2.9 
The frequency of streamlined verifications (and credit issuance) is at the discretion of the project 
proponent.  
9.2.10 Streamlined verifications will not be permitted if: 
a. It has been more than 12 months since the last full verification. 
b. A new VVB is used.  
c. If the VVB cannot fulfil requirements of reasonable assurance given identified project risks. 
d. The VVB concludes that significant risks or changes to project operations require more 
thorough review, such as changes to biomass sourcing policy or storage operator. 
9.2.11 All reports may include additional elements from the monitoring plan, as requested by the VVB. 
Validation/verification bodies  
9.2.12 Verification bodies shall use professional judgment in tailoring a verification process appropriate 
for each validation and verification event. 
9.2.13 All VVBs must be able to demonstrate accreditation from one of the following:  
a. A domestic or international accreditation body pursuant to ISO 14064-3:2019, or to the most 
recent version of this standard.  
b. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Accreditation Standard for Designated 
Operational Entities.  
c. A relevant governmental or intergovernmental regulatory body. 
9.2.14 Any conflict of interest must be avoided according to ISO 14065:2020. This includes potential 
conflicts of interest between the project proponent, VVBs, and individuals involved with the 
project and verification teams.   
9.2.15 The level of assurance for each verification is to be reasonable, with a materiality threshold of +/-
2%. All credits issued are to be ex-post after a positive project validation and subsequent positive 
verification report.

Appendix A - Zero-rating of biomass and basis of 
removal 
Biomass shall be treated in accordance with accounting conventions laid out in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories. 
In accordance, CO2 emissions from biomass shall be zero-rated at the point of use: “Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions from the combustion of biomass or biomass-based products are captured within the CO2 
emissions in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector through the estimated 
changes in carbon stocks from biomass harvest, even in cases where the emissions physically take place 
in other sectors. This approach to estimate and report all CO₂ emissions from biomass or biomass-based 
products in the AFOLU sector was introduced in the first IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas 
emissions (IPCC 1995), reflecting close linkages with data on biomass harvesting, and for the pragmatic 
reason to avoid double counting.”23 
The capture and permanent storage of CO2 from biomass may therefore deliver permanent negative 
emissions: 
“If the [carbon capture and storage] plant is supplied with biofuels, the corresponding CO2 emissions will 
be zero (these are already included in national totals due to their treatment in the AFOLU sector), so the 
subtraction of the amount of gas transferred to long-term storage may give negative emissions. This is 
correct since if the biomass carbon is permanently stored, it is being removed from the atmosphere.”24 
To ensure overall climate benefit, it is therefore imperative that biomass sourced for BECCS has a neutral 
or positive impact on carbon stocks in the land sector. The sustainability criteria laid out in Appendix C 
are to ensure that only sources of biomass delivering an overall net removal of carbon from the 
atmosphere are credited, while further ensuring that overall ecosystem health is protected.

Appendix B – Countries initially assessed under storage 
and permanence requirements 
The list below shows the jurisdictions against which the storage and permanence requirements in this 
methodology have been assessed. Only storage operators operating under these jurisdictions shall be 
considered compliant with the storage and permanence requirements expressed in chapter 8. Further 
countries will be added to the list over time as the methodology is expanded to more jurisdictions. 
Applicable storage and permanence jurisdictions (as of October 2023) and local regulations on storage and 
permanence: 
• 
European Economic Area (EEA): 
o The 2009/31/EC directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide 
• 
United States of America (USA) 
o At the federal level, the EPA’s Class VI rules from 2010 
o Relevant state level regulations, for example Louisiana’s 2009 geologic sequestration of 
carbon dioxide act 
• 
United Kingdom (UK) 
o The storage of carbon dioxide regulations of 2010 and 2011.

Appendix C – Sustainability criteria for forest biomass 
This appendix outlines the criteria that a project proponent must follow to ensure that the forest biomass 
used for BECCS is sustainable. Projects that fulfil the requirements below, or meet the exemption 
requirements, will be applicable for issuing CDR credits. Where biomass is sourced from multiple regions, 
each sourcing region shall comply with the requirements and provide appropriate evidence against the 
criteria below. Note that sustainability criteria for alternative biomass sources is detailed in Appendix K.25 
Stable or increasing forest carbon stock 
The project proponent shall conduct a carbon stock assessment for all sourcing areas that provide 
biomass inputs for BECCS processes. Assessments shall review changes in carbon stocks and conclude if 
the stock is stable, increasing, or declining. A carbon stock assessment shall be completed at project 
validation, and at each subsequent verification, and the results shall be verified by the VVB.  
For projects sourcing biomass from territories larger than 5 million km2, carbon stock assessments of the 
sourced biomass shall be conducted on the forest sourcing area level. For projects sourcing biomass from 
territories smaller than 5 million km2, carbon stock assessments of the sourced biomass shall be 
conducted either on the:  
a. Jurisdictional level as reported for forest land and harvested wood products within the LULUCF 
sector to UNFCCC; or 
b. Forest sourcing area level.  
Jurisdictional approach 
For projects that assess carbon stock changes at the jurisdictional level, national statistics for forest land 
and harvested wood products submitted to UNFCCC are required to demonstrate compliance with this 
carbon stock principle. Carbon stock changes shall be assessed using an average of the last five years of 
available UNFCCC data representing changes in emissions of forest lands and harvested wood products 
reported within the LULUCF sector26. This ‘rolling average’ shall be calculated with the most recently 
available primary data to the jurisdiction at each point of verification. Carbon stocks will be considered 
stable or increasing where the rolling average of these emissions is zero or negative27, whereby a negative 
value represents an increase in carbon stocks. 
 
25  As of version 0.9, requirements for agricultural biomass have not yet been developed. 
26  It is recognized that there is a delay in collecting LULUCF data submitted to UNFCCC, hence a five year rolling average is the 
preferred calculation approach. 
27  In UNFCCC inventories, an increase in land carbon stocks is reported as a negative value since this corresponds to negative 
emissions.  
 
 
 
41  
 
Forest sourcing area approach 
For assessments completed at the forest sourcing area level, assessment shall be conducted based on 
changes in carbon stock on attributable managed lands within the sourcing region. For undertaking the 
assessment, the following requirements shall be adhered to: 
• 
Assessment shall, as a minimum, consider carbon stock change in above ground biomass. Below 
ground biomass, carbon in dead matter and carbon in soils may either be quantified, or evidence 
provided, that such carbon stocks are not negatively impacted. 
• 
Assessments shall compare changes in carbon stocks using an average of the last five years of 
available data. This ‘rolling average’ shall be calculated with the most recently available primary 
data for each sourcing area, and at each point of verification. Carbon stocks will be considered 
stable or increasing where the rolling average is zero or positive. 
• 
Priority shall be given to data sources underlying the development of national LULUCF 
inventories. Use of alternative data sources (e.g. bespoke remote sensing) shall be duly justified, 
with particular consideration given to data accuracy and reliability.  
In exceptional circumstances, the carbon stock principle may still be fulfilled for biomass sourced from 
areas with declining carbon stocks. This applies for both jurisdictional and forest sourcing area 
approaches. Such exceptions will only be allowed where a third party VVB concludes that: 
• 
A reduction in carbon stock within the assessment area is beyond the reasonable control of the 
project proponent and is not a result of over-harvesting of forests. Relevant examples may 
include: 
o Excessive levels of natural disturbance such as fire, earthquake, or pests.  
o Reductions were planned to stabilize or reverse the decline of future forest carbon stock 
(e.g. thinning to reduce fire risk in regions prone to fire damage). 
• 
A mitigation plan is in place to stabilize or reverse the decline of carbon stocks. 
Sustainable management of forests and maintenance of biodiversity  
Biomass shall be sourced from sustainably managed forests requiring that:  
a. The country in which forest biomass was harvested has national or sub-national laws applicable 
in the area of harvest as well as monitoring and enforcement systems; or 
b. Management systems are in place at the forest sourcing area ensuring: 
• 
Legality of harvesting operations  
• 
Forest regeneration of harvested areas  
• 
That areas designated by international or national law, or by the relevant competent 
authority for nature protection purposes, are protected with the aim of preserving 
biodiversity and preventing habitat destruction.  
 
 
 
42  
 
• 
That harvesting is carried out considering maintenance of soil quality and biodiversity 
according to sustainable forest management principles, with the aim of preventing negative 
impacts in a way that:  
o Avoids harvesting of stumps and roots.   
o Avoids harvesting on vulnerable soils.  
o Ensures harvesting of large clear-cuts is within maximum thresholds as defined in the 
country where the forest is located.  
o Ensures extraction of deadwood adheres to locally and ecologically appropriate 
retention thresholds.   
o Ensures logging systems minimize impacts on soil quality and biodiversity features 
and habitats. 
• 
That harvesting maintains or improves the long-term production capacity of the forest.   
From an EU perspective, the criteria of this section leverage the EU RED Article 29.6, as amended by 
REDIII.  
Protection of primary forests and other highly biodiverse ecosystems 
Biomass shall not be sourced from lands with high biodiversity value, namely:  
a. Primary forest, defined as woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication 
of human activity and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed; and old growth 
forest, as defined in the legislation of the country in which the forest is located.  
b. Highly biodiverse forest, as identified by the relevant competent authority, unless evidence is 
provided that the harvesting of the biomass does not interfere with those nature protection 
purposes. 
c. Highly biodiverse grassland.  
 
From an EU perspective, the criteria of this section leverage the EU RED Article 29.3 and 29.6 as amended 
by REDIII. 
Protection of high carbon stock lands 
Biomass shall not be sourced from lands recently converted from a status with high carbon stock value, 
namely: 
a. 
Wetlands. 
b. 
Peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw 
material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil. 
From an EU perspective, the criteria of this section leverage the EU RED Article 29.4 & 29.5, as amended 
by REDIII. 
 
 
 
43  
 
Long-lived wood products  
To protect harvested wood product-based carbon sinks and their climate benefit in substituting carbon 
intensive products, biomass shall not be sourced from material suitable for use in long-lived wood 
products such as sawtimber or veneer within the sourcing area.  
Sources of roundwood, whose characteristics make them unsuitable for use in higher value markets 
when considering forest, market, and logistical conditions, are eligible. Sources may include thinning, 
pulpwood, or down-graded wood due to fire, storms, infestation, fungus or fiber that is logistically or 
otherwise unsuitable for use in long-lived products.   
Corruption  
Biomass shall not be sourced from any country with a Corruption Perception Index28 <50, except where a 
supplier demonstrates adequate mitigation of the risk of corruption.  
Exemptions  
Post-consumer forms of biomass (e.g. wood waste) shall be exempt from the sustainability criteria. 
However, such forms require verification that the waste has not been deliberately produced for the 
purposes of providing biomass for BECCS.  
Biomass residues from processing (e.g. sawmill residues) shall be exempt from the ‘Stable or increasing 
forest carbon stock’ criteria on the basis that demand for such biomass has little influence over land 
management decisions and consequently carbon stock changes. All other sustainability criteria shall 
apply. However, due regard shall be given to traceability challenges for such material when considering 
evidence necessary to demonstrate adherence. 
Traceability and mass balance  
Biomass shall be traceable throughout the value chain using either a physical segregation or mass 
balance approach. Where using a mass balance approach, the mass balance system shall:  
a. Allow consignments of biomass with differing sustainability and GHG characteristics to be mixed.   
b. Allow consignments of biomass with differing energy content to be mixed for the purposes of further 
processing, provided that the size of consignments is adjusted according to energy content.  
c. Ensure sustainability and GHG characteristics remain assigned to the mixture through the chain of 
custody.  
d. Provide for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the 
same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to 
the mixture and require that this balance be achieved over an appropriate period. 
 
28 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index: Explore the… - Transparency.org 
 
 
 
44  
 
e. Ensure that sustainability and GHG characteristics are not double-counted across consignments.  
f. Ensure that sustainable biomass is not mixed with illegally harvested sources. 
Certification/Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV)  
Verification of biomass sources against biomass sustainability requirements in this methodology shall be 
demonstrated through one or more of three routes:  
a. Certification – Biomass sources are verified against the relevant criteria through a biomass 
sustainability certification scheme, such as the Sustainable Biomass Programme (SBP), the Forestry 
Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), the 
Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), and received 
with the requisite claim. Alternatively, verification against maintenance or improvement of forest 
carbon stock criteria may be conducted in accordance with relevant corporate GHG disclosure 
standards such as the GHG Protocol.  
b. Regulatory compliance – Biomass sources’ compliance with the sourcing principles are verified by a 
third party or by national authorities in accordance with sustainability criteria set out in national or 
jurisdictional regulation.   
c. Independent assurance – Biomass is independently verified by a third party against the biomass 
sustainability requirements laid out in this methodology. Verification shall be conducted in 
accordance with ISAE 3000 limited assurance engagement or equivalent as a minimum. Verification 
shall be performed annually as a minimum.  
Where verification of a biomass source may be partially demonstrated through certification or 
regulation, independent assurance (c) may be additionally used against those requirements not covered. 
Where using a combination of both certification/regulation and independent assurance, it shall be clearly 
demonstrated which requirements are met through certification and regulation and which are met 
through independent assurance. 
Non-compliance 
If any consignments of sourced biomass fail to fulfil the requirements in this section, and do not fulfil the 
exception criteria described, then the project proponent shall not be issued with CDR credits from CO2 
removal volumes derived from these consignments.  
The project proponent shall decrease issuance of net removal certificates by the proportion of biomass 
feedstock sourced from consignments that fail to fulfil sustainability criteria, compared to the total 
volume of biomass feedstock sourced for the BECCS process. Compliance with the criteria shall be 
assessed based on the best available evidence at the time of crediting. 
 
 
 
45  
 
Revisions 
The sustainability criteria apply a risk averse approach to biomass sourcing. However, it is duly 
recognized that there can be substantial potential benefits of improved forest management within 
forests of high ecological value (including both carbon stocks and biodiversity), particularly in forests 
prone to natural disturbance events exacerbated by climate change. 
These criteria will therefore be subject to continuous review to ensure that the principles remain aligned 
with the latest scientific consensus on biomass sourcing, with a view to delivering meaningful climate 
and nature benefit through improved forest management.

Appendix D – Energy leakage 
Energy leakage is defined as the emissions impact from a rise in overall energy intensity resulting from 
CCS operations (e.g. an increased grid emissions factor or changes in heat emissions intensity). It is 
distinct from direct emissions from CCS operation, which are accounted for within the project boundary. 
Energy leakage is considered a form of market leakage under the classification structure defined in 
chapter 6. The treatment of energy leakage in this methodology depends both on the type of BECCS 
project – retrofit or new-build – and on the policy environment in which the project proponent operates. 
Requirements 
Project type 
New-build BECCS power and/or heat plants lower grid and/or heat energy intensity by adding new zero-
rated energy capacity (see chapter 5). Therefore, new-build BECCS projects do not require any energy 
leakage adjustments. 
Energy leakage only needs to be assessed, therefore, in the case of retrofit BECCS projects. Due to the 
addition of CCS installations, a BECCS plant may supply less net energy to the grid compared to the 
baseline, thereby potentially increasing energy emission intensity.29 If a retrofit BECCS project supplies 
less energy to the grid than before the project commencement, then the project proponent shall make 
energy leakage adjustments as described below. However, if a project proponent can demonstrate that 
the CCS project has increased plant energy output, they do not need to make any adjustments for energy 
leakage as it can be seen to add to renewable capacity. In the case of retrofit BECCS, the VVB shall assess 
the evidence of changes in energy output and outline whether any energy leakage adjustments will be 
required. 
Policy environment 
In jurisdictions with cap-and-trade schemes in place covering the power and heat generation sectors, 
energy leakage is non-material because any increase in energy emissions resulting from increased CCS 
energy use will necessitate reductions in emissions from other parts of the energy system due to the 
jurisdictional emissions cap. In this case, the CCS component of a retrofit BECCS project cannot be said 
to create energy leakage, as the emissions must be reduced from elsewhere in the energy system to keep 
emissions from the power and heat sector in line with the emissions cap. 
In jurisdictions without cap-and-trade systems for the power and heat sectors, the project proponent 
shall quantify net energy leakage emissions and subtract them from net removals. 
 
 
29 Note that for combined heat and power (CHP) plants, the effect on emissions intensity of heat may be the opposite. The 
project proponent shall assess this prior to each credit issuance. 
 
 
 
47  
 
Assessment 
In cases where assessment of energy leakage is required, the project proponent shall estimate the 
additional emissions that are being generated through the impact on regional grid emissions intensity 
resulting from retrofit CCS energy using the following equation:   
𝑀𝐿𝐸 = (𝑃𝑋𝐵 − 𝑃𝑋𝑃) × 𝑃𝐺𝐼 + (𝐻𝑋𝐵 − 𝐻𝑋𝑃) × 𝐻𝐺𝐼

In case the change in power and heat production in the BECCS plant impacts the Project proponent’s 
production system, including possible regional cooperation for heat, such impacts shall be included in 
the calculation above. For example, increased heat delivery from the BECCS plant may reduce the need 
for electricity in centralised heat pumps. Additional guidance will be provided in due course on how to 
account for change in carbon leakage over time, particularly for situations where energy delivered in the 
baseline and grid carbon intensities are anticipated to change over time. 
In cases where the regional electricity grid emission factor is less than 18g CO2e/MJ, leakage can be 
assumed to be zero.30 The regional electricity grid is defined as the bidding zone and/or national grid 
where the different CCS facilities are located. 
Retrofit BECCS plants where fuel switching from fossil fuel to sustainable biomass occurs (e.g. conversion 
from coal) is not considered to result in energy leakage, provided that the avoided emissions occurring 
as a result of the fuel switching activity is not separately credited under the voluntary carbon market. To 
be considered under this condition, the bioenergy power and/or heat plant shall have been operational 
for less than or equal to 48 months prior to installation of the CCS equipment.  
 
 
 
 
30 This is based on the European Union’s Delegated Act rules on hydrogen production, which allow for fuels produced using 
electricity from a grid with emissions intensity of less than 18g CO2e/MJ to be classified as renewable. Delegated Act available

Appendix E – Stakeholder consultation and grievance 
mechanism requirements 
Stakeholder consultation requirements 
For new-build BECCS facilities, the project proponent shall conduct a public consultation prior to 
breaking ground on the project. For retrofit projects, this is only necessary where the project will expand 
the physical footprint of the facility (e.g. additional pipelines, or expanded plant boundaries). This is to 
ensure that public feedback is considered, and any concerns are addressed appropriately by the time the 
project becomes operational. 
To promote inclusivity, the project proponent shall identify and invite all relevant stakeholders to engage 
with the project development process. Those invited shall include, as a minimum: 
• 
Representatives from local governing bodies. 
• 
Relevant non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
• 
Residents from surrounding areas where the project will be located. 
A physical or an online meeting link shall be set up for all consultations – to at least allow virtual 
participation in circumstances where all stakeholders cannot join meetings in-person. Invites shall be sent 
out no less than one month in advance to allow time for participants to plan to attend. Invites shall include 
the date, time, venue, reason for organizing the public consultation, and live link to the online meeting. 
Some consultations may be offered on a single stakeholder basis, as appropriate.  
The project proponent shall prepare documentation with evidence and outcomes of the consultations, 
which shall include at least the following: 
• 
List of invitees/target groups. 
• 
List of attendees. 
• 
Agenda of the meeting. 
• 
Minutes of the meeting. 
• 
Questions and feedback received from participants, including responses by the project 
proponent to those questions and any subsequent actions to be carried out. 
At the point of validation, the project proponent shall demonstrate to the VVB what action, if any, they 
have taken as a result of local stakeholder consultation and the reasons for taking, or not taking, action.  
Grievance mechanism 
Simultaneous to planning and organizing public consultation, the project proponent shall create and 
adopt a grievance redressal mechanism or equivalent community engagement mechanism. The project 
proponent shall make all stakeholders aware of the mechanism and its uses. The grievance redressal 
 
 
 
49  
 
mechanism will allow any parties affected by the project and acting in good faith to provide feedback or 
grievances directly to the project proponent. The grievance mechanism must be available through both 
the implementation and operation phases of the project, and have easily accessible points of contact 
such as: 
• 
A dedicated email address. 
• 
A help desk phoneline.  
• 
An in-person help desk at a local office of the project. 
The project proponent shall respond to grievances raised also in good faith and maintain a log of all 
grievances received, and their resolution, throughout the crediting period of the project. The project 
proponent may wish to publish grievance and resolution logs on relevant project websites to provide 
transparency to affected stakeholders, and to encourage public participation through the life of the 
project. 
 
 
 
 
50  
 
Appendix F – Safeguards 
The BECCS project shall adhere to safeguards which ensure that any negative social and environmental 
impacts are considered and mitigated. 
At the point of project validation, the project proponent must demonstrate that the project, including 
business partners, has obtained all required relevant environmental and business permits in the 
jurisdictions of sourcing, capture and storage operations. These safeguards shall apply to all stages of the 
BECCS value chain, including biomass sourcing, carbon capture and processing sites, CO2 transportation, 
injection, and storage. Furthermore, the project proponent shall review the full list of sustainable 
safeguards outlined below and confirm that they have considered each and, where requested, provide 
the VVB with copies of the assessments provided and mitigations to be implemented. 
Assessment and management of environmental and social risks 
• 
Abide by national and local laws, objectives, programs and regulations and, where relevant, 
international conventions and agreements; assess risks of negative environmental and social 
impacts with regard to the safeguards.  
•

Appendix H – Registry requirements  
The application of the methodology must be compatible with a registry that follows the requirements 
detailed in this appendix. A registry is a standardized platform for the issuance, trading, and retirement 
of carbon credits that provides a system for verifying the validity and authenticity of the credits, and for 
ensuring they are not double-counted or sold more than once. The registry can be held by a certification 
body, a body appointed by national authorities, or by an international organization.  
The registry shall operate a system that can uniquely identify each CDR credit, associated physical carbon 
removals, ownership of the credit, and any other relevant attributes. It shall have open interfaces to allow 
for cost-efficient integration with multiple CDR credit trading platforms and national or international 
registries for host nation positions.  
The registry shall carry the following information for each CDR credit:  
• 
Serial number  
• 
Issuing organization  
• 
Issue date  
• 
Last cancellation date  
• 
Feedstock (biomass or air)  
• 
Capture company  
• 
Capture plant  
• 
Capture method  
• 
Transportation method  
• 
Storage location  
• 
Storage method, with permanence classification (“Geological storage”)  
• 
Reversal mechanism  
• 
Transaction chain (price, date of sale, seller and purchaser)  
• 
Cancellation date  
• 
Cancelling party (holding corporation at the time of cancellation)  
• 
Volume (standardized to 1 tonne or appropriate multiple thereof)  
• 
Amount of CO₂ subtracted from gross tonne injected to arrive at net tonne (for issuance as CDR 
credits) 
It is noted that credits issued under this methodology are traded between corporations for voluntary 
purposes and corporate climate target claims. Consequently, it is possible that the underlying physical 
 
 
 
56  
 
 
removal and storage of CO₂ may in parallel be claimed by host nations for the achievement of national 
climate targets. This is consistent with the VCMI Claims Code of Practice requirements for reporting high-
quality carbon credits: “In the absence of a host country’s authorization and subsequent corresponding 
adjustment, companies must publicly communicate that the mitigation underlying the carbon credit may 
also be counted towards the host country’s NDC.”31

Appendix I – Managing data 
This appendix details how the project proponent must monitor, document and report all metrics 
identified within this methodology. Following this guidance will ensure the project proponent measures 
and confirms carbon removed and long-term storage compliance, and will enable quantification of the 
emissions removal resulting from the project activity during the project crediting period, prior to each 
verification.  
This methodology utilizes a comprehensive monitoring and documentation framework that captures the 
GHG impact in each stage of a BECCS project. Monitoring and detailed accounting practices must be 
conducted throughout to ensure the continuous integrity of the carbon removals and crediting. 
Requirements 
• 
The project proponent must develop and apply a monitoring plan according to ISO 14064-2 
principles of transparency and accuracy that allows the quantification and proof of GHG 
emissions removals.  
• 
The project proponent must monitor all the parameters listed below to ensure proper operation 
under this methodology.

are reported in the PDD for project validation but not in the verification reports since they have occurred prior to the project and hence will not change over the course of the 
crediting period.

tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases, 
which can be bought and sold on carbon markets to help individuals, 
organizations, or countries achieve their decarbonisation objectives. 
Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS) 
Process that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial 
processes, power plants, or the atmosphere, and stores them underground 
or in other long-term storage facilities. 
Carbon Dioxide Removal 
(CDR)

Union's single market to some member states of the European Free Trade 
Association (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein). 
Enhanced Hydrocarbon 
Recovery (EHR) 
Practice of recovering hydrocarbons additional to those produced naturally 
by injecting gas such as CO2 or water.

Geological Storage 
The storage of carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations. 
Greenhouse Gas, (GHG) 
Group of chemical compounds, including carbon dioxide, methane, and 
water vapor, that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to the 
warming of the planet. 
Global Warming 
Potential (GWP) 
A measure of how much energy the emission of 1 tonne of a gas will absorb 
over time compared to the emissions of 1 tonne of CO2. It is used to 
estimate the potential future impact of different gases on the climate 
system.

on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Scientific body established by the United Nations to assess the science, 
risks, and impacts of climate change, and provide policymakers with 
recommendations for addressing the issue. 
Issuance 
Act of generating or producing new carbon credits and making them 
available for purchase in a carbon market. 
Leakage 
Emissions sources outside of net removals quantification boundaries (see 
chapter 3 on project boundaries) that increase/decrease as a result of 
project operations. Four leakage categories are commonly recognised: 
upstream/downstream emissions, activity-shifting, market leakage and 
ecological leakage.  
Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) A method to quantify the environmental impacts of a product or service 
throughout its lifecycle. 
Mitigation 
reduction or prevention of greenhouse gas emissions and other actions 
taken to minimize the extent or impact of climate change. 
Monitoring, reporting 
and verification (MRV) 
Process of accounting for all the emissions, energy use, environmental and 
public health impacts associated with a carbon removal project to 
determine its net climate impact, thereby showing if the work was done 
safely and effectively. 
Partner (business) 
Any party involved in upstream and/or downstream BECCS value chain 
activities that is contracted by the project proponent.  
Project Design 
Document (PDD) 
A document that compiles all relevant project data and reflects the project 
proponent’s plan for adherence to the requirements of this methodology.  
Project proponent 
The project proponent is the party that has the overall control over and 
responsibility for the BECCS project that generates CDR credits, typically 
the operator or owner of the carbon capture system. 
Primary forest 
Naturally regenerated forests of native tree species where there are no 
clearly visible indications of human activity and the ecological processes 
are not significantly disturbed. 
Project boundary 
The project boundary covers all relevant activities leading to carbon 
sources and sinks that are exclusively initiated by the anticipation of CDR 
credit revenue from the project.  
Registry 
Standardized platform for the issuance, trading, and retirement of  carbon 
credits, providing a system for verifying the validity and authenticity of the 
credits, and for ensuring that they are not double-counted or sold more 
than once. 
Removal credit 
Type of carbon credit that is generated by a project or activity that removes 
carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and can, if 
it is stored geologically, be used to neutralise emissions. 
Reporting 
Submission of data and evidence to a third-party organisation (a VVB) for 
the purpose of independently assuring project outcomes. 
 
 
77  
Reversal 
Any migration of carbon dioxide from its geological reservoirs post 
injection. 
Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 
Set of 17 global goals established by the United Nations to promote 
sustainable development and address social, economic, and environmental 
challenges, including poverty, inequality, and climate change. 
Sequestration 
Process of capturing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in a way 
that prevents it from contributing to global warming. 
Transport and storage 
operators 
Operators of the carbon dioxide transportation and/or storage facilities, 
which hold the appropriate licenses and permits to transport, drill and 
operate injection and monitoring wells. 
Validation 
Process whereby a validation/verification body (VVB) confirms a project’s 
adherence to all requirements in this methodology. Project validation is a 
pre-requisite for CDR crediting.  
Validation/verification 
bodies (VVB) 
Independent third-party auditors that assess whether a project or program 
complies with rules or standards.  
Verification

credit issuance. 
Voluntary Carbon Market 
(VCM) 
Platform where organizations and individuals can purchase and sell carbon 
credits voluntarily to offset their greenhouse gas emissions or support 
climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. 
Zero-rated biomass 
Combustion of biomass or biomass-based products in the energy sector is 
counted as generating zero emissions of carbon dioxide, because net 
carbon dioxide emissions resulting from changes in biomass carbon stocks 
are already accounted for by the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use 
(AFOLU) sector. This accounting principle was introduced by the IPCC to 
avoid double counting of emissions.
