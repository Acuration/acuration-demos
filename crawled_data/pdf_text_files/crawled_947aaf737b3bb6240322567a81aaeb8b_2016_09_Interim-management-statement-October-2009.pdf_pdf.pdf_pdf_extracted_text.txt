Interim Management Statement 
 
 
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 July 2009 to date. 
 
Since publishing our Half Year Results on 4 August, trading conditions in the commodity markets in 
which we operate remain challenging.  However, given our strong forward contracted position, we 
continue to trade in line with expectations for the current year.  
 
Other than the refinancing of the group’s debt facilities, details of which were included in the Half 
Year Results published on 4 August, there have been no material events or transactions, nor any 
material change in the underlying financial position of the group during the period. 
 
We will issue a pre close statement on 16 December 2009 in which we will update the market on 
the Group’s positions under contract for 2009, 2010 and 2011.
