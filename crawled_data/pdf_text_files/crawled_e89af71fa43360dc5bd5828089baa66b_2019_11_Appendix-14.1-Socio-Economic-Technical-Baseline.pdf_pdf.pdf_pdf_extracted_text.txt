Appendix 14.1 Socio-economic Technical 
Baseline 
 
14.1.1 The socio-economic profile sets a context for the assessment and highlights 
key socio-economic issues.  The indicators are also used to determine the 
overall sensitivity of the labour market (socio-economic receptor).   
14.1.2 As indicated in Table 14.8, all areas have experienced population increases 
since 2001, a trend which is expected to continue to 2035.  Over the same 
period the population of the UK has increased and is expected to rise further 
at a greater rate than the local area, wider area and wider region. The local 
area population is expected to grow at a lower rate in the future than that 
experienced between 2001 and 2017.  Population growth in the wider area 
and wider region is expected be below that of the UK.   Across the local area, 
wider area, wider region and comparator area, household growth is expected 
to exceed population growth (See Figure 14.1).

14.1.3 Current population data indicates that the proportion of potentially 
economically inactive residents (i.e. those aged between 0-16 and over 65) 
make up 36% of the population locally. This is consistent with the wider area 
and UK average. Projections for the region indicate that there will be a 
reduction in the working age population and increases in their dependency 
ratio1 which is likely to put additional pressure on services in the local and 
wider areas and wider region.  By 2035 nearly a quarter of the regional 
population2 is expected to be of retirement age.  This is greater than the 
projected UK average.

14.1.5 Age band projections are not available for the local area. However, projections 
for the administrative areas (i.e. the county of Swansea and the West Wales 
                                                      
1 The dependency ratio (or proportion of working age people) is significant as it measures the relationship 
between the productive element of a population and the economically dependent. In Swansea there is to be a 
reduction in the proportion of working age population from 63% to 62%. In West Wales, it will decrease from 62% 
to 58%. 
2 Age band projections not available on local level. Experian estimate that the proportion of residents at retirement 
age will be 24% in Swansea and 28% in West Wales

14.1.6 The economic activity rate is a useful measure of the labour market 
opportunities available in the area3.  As Table 14.11 shows, economic activity 
in the local area, wider area and wider region is significantly lower than the 
national average.

14.1.7 The local area, wider area and wider region are all characterised by marginally 
lower levels of unemployment compared to the national average. However, 
each area has a higher proportion of people who are permanently 
sick/disabled than the UK average. This is summarised in Table 14.12.  
 
 
                                                      
3 The economic activity rate measures the percentage of the population, both in employment and unemployed 
that represent the labour supply regardless of their labour status.   The figure represents the degree of success of 
the area in engaging people in productive activity.

14.1.8 The primary industries of employment in the local area include retail, human 
health and social work, education, and public administration/defence. 
Together these industries account for just over half of local employment. This 
is comparable to the wider area and wider region but higher than UK levels.  
Construction and manufacturing employment accounts for almost a fifth of all 
jobs in the study area. These industries make up a higher proportion of 
employment than in the UK. This is summarised in Table 14.13.

14.1.9 Location Quotients for the Study Area shows how they differ in relation to 
national averages for employment.4 On this measure, the local area, wider 
area 
and 
wider 
region 
have 
particular 
concentrations 
in 
public 
administration/defence and water supply, sewerage, waste management & 
remediation. The local and wider area also indicates the importance of mining 
                                                      
4 The Location Quotient quantifies the concentration of an industry in a geographical area compared to a wider 
reference area. A value of ‘1’ indicates parity in terms of the proportion of jobs in that industry compared to the 
national average, whilst the values below/above indicate a smaller/greater proportion of local jobs in that industry 
compared to the national average.

14.1.10 National Readership Survey (NRS) social grades are a system of 
demographic classification widely used in market research5.  The NRS social 
grades provide an insight into the skills profile of a population.  
14.1.11 As shown in Table 14.14, the local area, wider area and wider region each 
have a lower than average proportion of people in the highest and second 
highest social grades (AB and C1). Each area also has a higher proportion of 
people in the lowest social grades (DE). The wider region is slightly more 
skilled than the immediate local area.

 
Slightly lower levels of unemployment comparable to the UK average; 
 
A higher proportion of people working in construction and manufacturing 
jobs; 
 
Above average levels of employment in electricity and gas related 
occupations;  
 
A lower proportion of people working in high value professional, scientific 
and technical activities, and finance & insurance occupations;   
 
A higher proportion of people employed in semi-skilled/unskilled jobs and 
lower proportion of people in highly skilled jobs; and 
 
A higher proportion of people achieving no qualifications and low level 
qualifications compared to the UK average. 
14.1.14 In summary, the socio-economic study area exhibits some characteristics 
consistent with a low sensitivity labour market (i.e. increasing population and 
above average levels of construction and electricity and gas workers).  
14.1.15 It is unlikely that the Project will lead to undue labour market pressure or 
distortions (i.e. wage inflation, skills and capacity shortages, import of labour).
