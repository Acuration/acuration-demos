Biomass Sustainability
Dr Rebecca Heaton, Head of Climate Change
Why is Biomass Sustainable?
Sustainable biomass is a renewable fuel
Biomass use contributes to healthy forests:
– We only source from managed forests or where we can help 
forests stay healthy
– Healthy managed forests support biodiversity
– Healthy managed forests are more productive and absorb 
more carbon than unmanaged forests
Significant carbon savings relative to coal-fired and gas-fired 
generation
– Assessment of supply chain emissions are detailed and 
audited – from the forest to Drax
– Biomass takes carbon out of the atmosphere when growing 
and returns it when burnt

Biomass is Recognised as Having an Important Role In Climate Change Mitigation
“Bioenergy use is substantial in [all] 1.5°C pathways with or without BECCS due to its 
multiple roles in decarbonizing energy use.”
“Sustainably harvested biomass can play a significant role in meeting long-term climate 
targets, provided it is prioritised for the most valuable end uses.”
“Our scenarios suggest the UK could access enough sustainable biomass to provide 
between 5% and 15% of primary energy demand in 2050.” 
Globally and in the UK
BEIS public attitudes tracker
“Support for biomass reached a high of 70% in September 2019. This follows a trend of 
increasing support since September 2015, when 63% supported biomass.”

Managing Sustainability Risk
Strong regulatory framework, internal processes and 
external certification
Externally
–
Strong UK regulatory framework
–
EU Renewable Energy Directive II – sets minimum standards 
Drax exceeds
Internally
–
Annual 3rd party audit of suppliers
–
92% of feedstocks certified by Sustainable Biomass 
Programme in 2018
–
No subsidy withheld on sustainability grounds
–
Close monitoring of supply chain and locations
–
Close relationship and monitoring of suppliers
Regulator approved scheme 
–
Demonstrating 100% compliance with regulation
Multi-stakeholder governance with best practice
Broad uptake of pellet industry players
–
9mt of SBP-certified pellets  
–
65% of the EU-28 pellet consumption
–
200 organisations certified

We take from regions with large areas of growing 
forests and established forest industries
These areas offer us sustainable, economic supplies 
of biomass
Taking wood from forests that are growing and remain

Managing Sustainability Risk
Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions
Compliance with UK regulations requires full carbon foot printing of supply chain
–
Biomass supply chain is highly audited
Other energy sources are not required to do this
–
Any comparison should take into account the supply chain emissions from other energy sources
–
Even with the inequitable comparison, biomass still produces major carbon savings vs. alternatives
Emissions
–
Drax Group – 131kgCO2e/MWh – including supply chain emissions
–
UK Government biomass target – 285kgCO2e/MWh – including supply chain emissions
–
Coal – 870kgCO2e/MWh  – excluding supply chain emissions
–
Gas – 340kgCO2e/MWh – excluding supply chain emissions
