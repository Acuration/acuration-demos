Information Report (“2018 PEIR”) (Volume II: Figures and Photomontages) 
 
It has been identified that the numbering for “Ancient Woodlands” within Figure 8.3 of the 2018 
PEIR is incorrect.  This has been corrected and a replacement figure published (copy attached), 
with the replacement Figure 8.3 now corresponding correctly with the numbering contained 
within Table 8-10 of Chapter 8, “Ecology”, of the 2018 PEIR. 
 
The main body text in Chapter 8 of the 2018 PEIR, as well as all other information previously 
published, is unchanged and is not affected by this amendment. 
 
This amendment does not affect the consultation period on the Project, which is running from 
16th January 2018 until 19th February 2018 (inclusive), and we therefore continue to welcome 
your views on the Project which should be made on or before 5.00pm on 19th February 2018.
