INTRODUCTION  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the non-technical summary of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) prepared for the proposed 
Abergelli Power Project (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’). The 
PEIR has been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff on behalf of Abergelli 
Power Limited (APL). 
1.1.2 
The Project proposed is a gas-fired power station with a rated electrical 
output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW).  It is intended to be a 
‘peaking’ plant designed to operate when there is a surge in demand 
for electricity associated with a particular stress event (e.g. where there 
is a sudden demand in power required by consumers or a sudden drop 
in power being generated by plants which are constantly operational, 
such as a sudden outage).   
1.1.3 
An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is being undertaken to 
determine the likely significant effects of the project on the 
environment. The purpose of the PEIR is to present preliminary 
environmental information relating to the Project, including the 
preliminary findings of the EIA.  This will enable consultees, including 
the local community, to understand the potential likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project, so they can provide a 
comprehensive response to the consultation.  
1.1.4 
Copies of the PEIR, NTS and other consultation material including 
APL’s Statement of Community Consultation will be available at five 
local libraries as well as City and County of Swansea Council offices 
during the statutory consultation period from 13th October 2014 to 16th 
November 2014. In addition, the PEIR, NTS and other consultation 
material 
will 
be 
available 
on 
the 
APL 
website 
(www.abergellipower.co.uk) from 13th October 2014 and at public 
exhibitions which will be held by APL in Llangyfelach, Felindre, Clydach 
and Tircoed between 22nd and 25th October 2014.  Feedback received 
during the consultation process will help inform the development and 
design of the Project. Further detail about how feedback can be 
provided to APL is available in the Statement of Community 
Consultation. 
1.1.5 
Once complete, the findings of the EIA will be reported in full in the 
Environmental Statement to be submitted with the Application for a 
Development Consent Order.

1.2 
The Project 
1.2.1 
The Project (see Figure 1.1) would comprise: 
 A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle 
Gas Turbine (SCGT) generating station fuelled by natural gas 
and with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW which will 
operate during peak demand comprising; 
o 
The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine 
Generators and Plant which are located on the Generating 
Equipment Site; 
o 
A new Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site.  
Two options are currently under consideration:  from the 
north via Rhyd-y-pandy Road (Option 1); or from the west 
via the B4489 (Option 2); 
o 
A temporary construction compound (Laydown Area); 
 A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System; and 
 A new Electrical Connection to export power from the 
Generating 
Equipment 
to 
the 
National 
Grid 
Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS) for distribution to homes and 
businesses. 
1.2.2 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are 
together known as the Power Generation Plant, and are located within 
the Power Generation Plant Site.  
1.2.3 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would 
be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the 'Project Site'. Figure 1.1 shows how the elements of 
the Project relate to each other.  
1.2.4 
The Generating Equipment would consist of between one and five Gas 
Turbine Generators (and associated stacks of up to 40m). However, 
the combined rated electrical output will not exceed 299MW. 
1.2.5 
In the Gas Turbine Generators air is compressed and natural gas is 
injected. The fuel will then burn in the combustion chamber producing 
hot, high pressure gases. This gas expands across the blades of the 
gas turbine which drives the electrical generators to produce electricity. 
The exhaust silencer will reduce noise pollution from this process.

The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released 
to the atmosphere via stacks. The stack(s) will be equipped with 
emissions control technologies which will reduce emissions released to 
the atmosphere.

1.2.7 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan will be prepared to 
mitigate environmental effects during construction.  This will include 
measures to control dust, litter, noise and spillages.  A Construction 
Traffic Management Plan will be prepared which will set out the routes 
construction traffic must use and during which hours.  A Travel Plan will 
be prepared to encourage construction workers to minimise use of the 
private car. 
1.3 
Application for Development Consent 
1.3.1 
In Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is considered to be a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the Planning 
Act 20081 if its generating capacity is more than 50 MW. As the Project 
would have an electrical generating capacity of more than 50 MW it 
would be classified as a NSIP and therefore a Development Consent 
Order is required. It is therefore intended that an Application for a 
Development Consent Order will be submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate for examination on behalf of the Secretary of State for 
Energy and Climate Change. 
1.4 
The Applicant 
1.4.1 
The Project Applicant is APL. APL is an energy development company 
established for the Project by Watt Power Limited.  Further information 
on the companies is provided at http://www.abergellipower.co.uk and 
http://www.wattpowerltd.co.uk. 
1.5 
Needs and Benefits of the Project 
1.5.1 
There is considerable national need for this type of development, 
acknowledged at all levels of Government policy. National planning 
policy supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the 
current ageing and closure of coal-fired power plants and the likely 
increase in demand for electricity over the coming decades. 
1.5.2 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as 
being essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s 
energy security. In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project 
provide back-up to power generation from renewable sources, 
particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent energy source. Modern gas-fired power plants are among 
the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity power generation.

SITE AND SURROUNDINGS 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is situated predominantly on farmland and will be 
accessed from Junction 46 of the M4 to the north of Swansea, in the 
administrative area of the City and County of Swansea Council.  It is 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 m west of Llwyncelyn 
and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. 
2.1.2 
From the M4 there are two access options being considered at this 
stage: Option 1 from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road utilising the 
existing farm road which runs north/south; and Option 2 from the west 
via the B4489 utilising the existing National Grid road and then via 
agricultural land to the west of the Generating Equipment Site and land 
following the southern boundary of the Gas Compressor Station. 
2.1.3 
Part of the Project Site is currently used for grazing as well as horse 
training and breeding. The western extent of the Project Site 
encompasses National Grid’s Swansea North electrical substation and 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
2.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily within fields used 
for grazing bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and 
defunct hedgerows with substantial gaps in them.  
2.1.5 
The Gas Connection is located north of the Generating Equipment Site 
crossing farmland.  The Electrical Connection is located to the south 
west of the Generating Equipment Site linking in to the existing Gas 
Compressor Station.  
2.1.6 
The area surrounding the Project Site is partly rural with some existing 
and planned urban fringe development (e.g. Park and Ride Facilities) 
together with a substantial amount of utilities infrastructure in the area.

 REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
3.1.1 
The EIA takes into account all relevant European Union Directives and 
National Policy Statements which relate specifically to NSIPs, Welsh 
and local planning policy, and other relevant policy and guidance. 
4 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT  
4.1.1 
In accordance with the Planning Act 2008, as amended, and the 
Infrastructure Planning (EIA) Regulations 2009, the EIA process for the 
Project includes the following: 
 
Establishing, through consultation, the scope of the EIA including 
obtaining a Scoping Opinion from the Secretary of State; 
 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives; 
 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the Project Site and the 
relevant study areas for each topic; 
 
Identifying the potential environmental effects resulting from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project; 
 
Determining how the potential environmental effects can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set; 
 
Assessing the significance of the potential environmental effects 
in conjunction with other effects arising from the Project and 
those 
from 
other 
reasonably 
foreseeable 
neighbouring 
developments and/or sources; and 
 
Proposing options as to how any significant adverse residual 
effects will be mitigated, managed and monitored. 
4.1.2 
APL requested a Scoping Opinion from Planning Inspectorate in June 
2014. The request was supported by a Scoping Report that described 
the anticipated significant environmental issues that will require detailed 
evaluation as part of the EIA process. The Scoping Opinion was 
received in August 2014. It has allowed for agreement on the potential 
likely significant environmental effects of the Project and, therefore, the 
aspects of the environment on which the EIA should focus. 
4.1.3 
The organisations that have been consulted so far include: 
  Natural Resources Wales; 
 South and West Wales Wildlife Trust; 
 Abertawe Bro Morgannwy;

 Civil Aviation Authority;  
 Ministry of Defence; 
 Cadw; 
 Brecon Beacons National Park Authority; 
 City and County of Swansea Council; 
 Network Rail; and 
 The Coal Authority. 
4.1.4 
The detailed design of the Project will take place at a later stage in the 
development process, and only after a successful DCO application. At 
this stage the Project is described using maximum (and in some cases 
minimum) parameters which cannot be exceeded. As described in 
section 2 above, the Project would include up to five Gas Turbine 
Generators each with a stack of up to 40m in height. Therefore, the 
assessment of the Project for each topic is carried out on the basis of 
the worst case scenario from within the parameters for that topic (this is 
known as the Rochdale envelope approach and is an accepted method 
for describing and assessing projects of this type).  
4.1.5 
The PEIR is an intermediate step in the EIA process which provides a 
preliminary assessment and highlights which issues needs to be 
assessed further.  
4.1.6 
Due to the nature and location of the Project, it is considered that there 
will be no impacts caused by the Project that will affect any other EU 
Member State.  A Transboundary Screening assessment has been 
undertaken by the Planning Inspectorate which confirms this approach. 
4.1.7 
This Report provides a non-technical summary of all of the topic areas 
with the PEIR, which are as follows: 
 Air Quality; 
 Noise and Vibration; 
 Ecology; 
 Water Quality and Resources; 
 Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology; 
 Landscape and Visual;  
 Traffic, Transport and Access; 
 Archaeology and Cultural Heritage; and  
 Socio-Economics.

ALTERNATIVES 
5.1 
Alternative Project Sites 
5.1.1 
The choice of site for the Power Generation Plant has been carefully 
considered with various sites investigated and a number of factors 
looked at during this process. The main factors determining the 
selection of the Power Generation Plant Site are: proximity to Gas and 
Electrical Connection points; setting; and road access. The Project Site 
has been selected as it presents the best option in terms of the 
determining factors detailed above. 
5.2 
Project Site Boundary 
5.2.1 
The Project Site boundary outlined in red on Figure 2.1 has been 
reduced in size from the ‘Scoping’ stage to take account of the design 
refinement, including seeking to avoid environmentally sensitive areas, 
in relation to Gas and Electrical Connection routes.   
5.3 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.1 
The Generating Equipment would be designed as a peaking plant and 
would operate for up to 1,500 hours per year. Peaking plants are 
required to operate when there is a ‘stress event’. This occurs when 
there is a surge in demand for electricity or where there is a sudden 
drop in power being generated from plants which are constantly 
operational. Given these parameters, it has been determined that a 
Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant is the preferred and most appropriate 
technology choice for the Project, based on a range of environmental, 
technical and feasibility considerations including visual impact, use of 
water resources, noise and available space. The other technology 
choices considered at this stage included aero-derivative gas turbine 
generators and industrial gas turbine generators.  
5.3.2 
The potential for using Combined Heat and Power opportunities with 
these technologies was also considered. However it is not technically 
or economically feasible with a peaking power station because the 
generation of electrical energy from the station cannot be guaranteed to 
coincide with the required heat demand of any potential customer. 
5.4 
Access Road 
5.4.1 
There are two options for road access which are being consulted upon 
at this stage as described in Section 1.2.  Option 1 will include 
implementing improvements to the local road network and the widening 
of the existing track within the Project Site.  Option 2 will include the

5.5 
Electrical Connection  
5.5.1 
Both underground cables and overhead lines were considered.  
Underground cables were identified as the preferred option due to the 
limited visual impact.   
5.5.2 
The area to the south west of the Generating Equipment Site is the 
area within which the route for the Electrical Connection has been 
identified.  In July 2014, the chosen route was identified during a site 
walkover of the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area. A limited 
number of route corridor options for the Electrical Connection were 
considered, as the most appropriate option i.e. the shortest, most direct 
route from the Generating Equipment Site to the substation, requiring 
the least amount of land take and avoiding any statutory designated 
sites or valued habitats, was available. This negated the need to 
assess any less favourable options.

5.6 
Gas Connection 
5.6.1 
Four connection options have been explored and further refined to a 
single Gas Connection Route.  Cost, length and complexity as well as 
the potential presence of protected species were the main factors 
considered in choosing the preferred route (see Figure 2.1).  
6 
AIR QUALITY 
6.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon air quality. To date, a desk-
based assessment, including a stack height sensitivity test, and site 
walkover has been undertaken to assess any potential impacts upon air 
quality from the proposed Project. A summary of the results from this 
preliminary assessment is provided below. 
6.2 
Assessment Methodology 
6.2.1 
The assessment of construction dust impacts on humans is considered 
within 350 metres of potential dust sources and ecological receptors 
were considered within 100 metres. In relation to operational impacts, 
the study area extends 10 km in all directions from the Generating 
Equipment Site. There are no operational impacts on local air quality 
anticipated from the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
6.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
6.3.1 
There is an Air Quality Management Area located 4.5 km south of the 
Project Site. Air pollutants and particulate matter at the Project Site are 
expected to be well within the relevant air quality objectives. In 
summary, NO2 and particulate matter concentrations across the study 
area are generally very low, both in rural and suburban areas.  At the 
roadside, outside of urban areas, concentrations are higher but likely to 
be well within the air quality objectives. 
6.3.2 
The area is largely rural in character although it is located on the urban 
fringe, interspersed with small residential settlements. Residential 
properties along B4489, Pant Lasau Road, Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road have 
also been considered. The study area also includes a number of nature 
conservation sites. 
6.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
6.4.1 
It is considered unlikely that there will be permanent residual adverse 
effects associated with the construction of the Project. The effects 
relating to construction activities are all temporary. Effects during

operation of the Power Generation Plant are not expected to be 
significant. 
7 
NOISE AND VIBRATION  
7.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon noise and vibration. To date, a 
baseline noise survey has been undertaken to assess any potential 
impacts upon noise sensitive receptors, such as residential properties, 
from the proposed Project. A summary of the results from this 
preliminary assessment is provided below. 
7.2 
Assessment Methodology 
7.2.1 
The assessment methodologies used in the PEIR are the same as 
those that will be adopted for the EIA. However, the level of detail 
available at the PEIR stage is only sufficient to form preliminary 
conclusions. 
7.2.2 
Construction and decommissioning noise and vibration assessments of 
the Project has been undertaken following the guidance in the relevant 
British Standards.  An outline construction programme has been 
developed based on knowledge and experience of other similar 
developments. Additionally, the typical make up of construction 
equipment at each stage of the Project programme has been 
ascertained in the same way. The desk study has outlined suitable 
measures for the mitigation of construction and decommissioning 
impacts, and an assessment of residual effects.   
7.2.3 
Vibration from construction activities may impact on adjacent buildings.  
The criteria used in this assessment relates to the potential for 
cosmetic damage, not structural damage.  The principal concern is 
generally vibration due to impact piling. Due to the minimum distance of 
a 230 m to the closest neighbouring structure (NG Compressor 
Station), a detailed construction vibration assessment has not been 
included in the PEIR. 
7.2.4 
A baseline noise survey has been undertaken in the vicinity of the 
Project Site to establish the current baseline noise levels. The 
monitoring locations for the baseline survey included a selection of the 
nearest noise sensitive receptors. These locations were agreed in 
advance with Swansea Council.

7.2.5 
The operation of the Gas and Electrical Connections is not anticipated 
to cause any significant increase in background noise or vibration and 
is therefore scoped out of the assessment. 
7.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
7.3.1 
The closest Noise Sensitive Receptors within 1 km of the Project Site 
include those within the nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau, 
Llwyncelyn and Felindre. In addition there are also isolated dwellings 
and farmsteads throughout the study area. 
7.3.2 
A noise survey was undertaken to determine the spread of noise in the 
area. A number of attended short term sampling measurements were 
taken over a period of 24hrs.  In addition, two unattended long term 
noise monitors were used. These measured noise levels continuously 
at two locations for 7 days.  Noise levels were measured at between 24 
and 34 decibels. 
7.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
7.4.1 
Predicted effects will range between Slight and Moderate adverse and 
therefore may or may not be significant at the construction and 
decommissioning stages of the Power Generation Plan. During 
operation, the effects are predicted to be slight adverse and therefore 
not significant. 
7.4.2 
The operation of neither the Gas Connection nor the underground 
Electrical Connection would give rise to any noticeable noise during 
operation.  Any increases in noise levels will represent a temporary 
increase which will be restricted to the duration of the construction 
activities.  The effects are predicted to be Slight adverse and therefore 
not significant. 
7.4.3 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant, Access Option 1 
will have a Moderate adverse effect for Felin Wen Farm, but for Option 
2 it will only be a Slight effect.  There is no discernable difference 
between Option 1 and 2 during operation, or for the construction and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection or Electrical Connection.

ECOLOGY 
8.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon ecology. To date, a desk 
based study and a range of protected species surveys has been 
undertaken (some are on-going) to assess any potential impacts upon 
ecology from the proposed Project. A summary of the results from this 
preliminary assessment is provided below.

Assessment Methodology 
8.2.1 
A desk study was carried out within a study area of 10 km to identify 
statutory designated sites and bat records, and 2 km for non-statutory 
designated sites and protected/notable species. An Extended Phase 1 
Habitat Survey was undertaken in February and July 2014. Surveys 
were also carried out for badgers, dormouse, otter, water vole, bats, 
breeding birds, Great Crested Newts, reptiles, terrestrial and aquatic 
invertebrates, flora and invasive species such as Japanese knotweed.  
Some of these surveys are still to be completed. 
8.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
8.3.1 
There are a total of 35 statutory designated sites within a 10 km radius 
of the Project Site and 23 non-statutory designated sites within 2 km of 
the Project Site, as well as 101 areas of Ancient Woodland. The Project 
Site is located predominantly on pastoral farmland, mostly agriculturally 
improved but with large areas of marshy grassland and interspersed by 
woodland and scrub. There are numerous watercourses on site, mostly 
in the form of ditches or streams along field boundaries.

8.3.2 
Signs of badgers were recorded during other surveys so they are 
known to be present in the wider area.  
8.3.3 
No dormice have been found to date, however further checks are yet to 
be undertaken.  
8.3.4 
The desk study provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search 
radius, with the closest record 0.5 km to the south west of the River 
Llan. During the 2014 surveys a single fresh otter spraint was found in 
the stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site. No 
other signs were observed that confirm otter presence within the 
Survey Site.  
8.3.5 
No records or fields signs provided evidence that water voles existing in 
close proximity to the Project Site, although historic records (from 1996) 
were provided from the River Llan, 1.9 km from the Project Site.  
8.3.6 
Surveys of buildings within the Survey Site confirmed at least four 
buildings are used as bat roosts. None of buildings will be directly 
affected by the Project. 35 trees were located within the Survey Site 
that were considered to present potential to support roosting bats.  
Surveys were carried out on eight of these trees and no bats were 
recorded.  Preliminary activity survey findings recorded at least eight 
species of bats using the Survey Site.  The highest numbers of passes 
were recorded along linear features such as hedges or streams. 
8.3.7 
Seven bird ‘species of principal importance for nature conservation’ 
were recorded on site, as well as other species of conservation concern 
in Wales. 
8.3.8 
Great Crested Newt presence/absence surveys have been undertaken 
and likely absence of species was recorded in all accessible 
waterbodies subject to survey.  Therefore, for the purposes of this 
assessment, the absence of Great Crested Nets is assumed in all 
waterbodies within 250 m of the Project Site boundary. 
8.3.9 
Reptile presence/absence surveys across the Project Site are currently 
on-going, however to date common lizard and grass snakes were found 
present. 
8.3.10 
A total of 217 invertebrate species were recorded from the Survey Site. 
8.3.11 
National Vegetation Classification survey results are yet to be 
analysed. 
8.3.12 
Invasive species surveys across the Project Site were completed and 
five species of plant were recorded during the survey.  The final design

will seek to avoid the locations where these species were recorded 
where possible. 
8.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
8.4.1 
Potential effects during the construction and decommissioning phases 
of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are envisaged to be mainly temporary. Effects are 
predicted to range between Slight and Moderate and therefore may or 
may not be significant.  However, there is potential for loss of Ancient 
Woodland and non-statutory designated sites, which cannot be 
mitigated against or replaced and this will result in a major effect, and 
therefore significant, if Access Option 2 is implemented.  
8.4.2 
Effects during operation, such as disturbance of protected species, are 
likely to be between Slight and Moderate.  Given that the Gas and 
Electrical Connections will be buried underground, with very small 
areas situated above ground, the residual effects are predicted to range 
between Slight and Moderate, depending on the level of disturbance 
and therefore may or may not be significant.  
8.4.3 
A Habitat Regulations Assessment Screening will be conducted to 
identify any potential impacts on internationally designated sites. 
9 
WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES  
9.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon water quality and resources. 
To date, a site walkover and desk-based assessment of risks has been 
undertaken to assess any potential impacts upon water quality and 
resources from the proposed Project. A summary of the results from 
this preliminary assessment is provided below. 
9.2 
Assessment Methodology 
9.2.1 
The study area generally includes features within 1 km of the Project 
Site boundary. However, more distant features that may be 
hydraulically connected to the Project Site have also been considered. 
9.2.2 
Hydrological features have been identified from OS mapping with 
information on geology, water quality and flood risk obtained from the 
Environment Agency website. All aspects of supply, demand and 
disposal of water and process effluents have been assessed for the 
construction, operational and decommissioning phases.

9.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
9.3.1 
The main watercourse that traverses the area is Afon Llan which flows 
in a south-westerly direction to the west and south of the Project Site, 
eventually discharging to the Loughor Estuary. There are a number of 
smaller watercourses within the vicinity of the Project Site that drain to 
the Afon Llan, along with a number of springs and small ponds. The 
Felindre Water Treatment Works with covered reservoir is situated 
immediately north of the Project Site.  
9.3.2 
The Afon Lliw, which also discharges into the Loughor Estuary, is 
located approximately 1.3 km north of the Project Site. With the 
possible exception of the northern boundary, the Project Site is outside 
of the Afon Lliw topographic catchment and therefore it is expected that 
any direct connectivity will be limited. 
9.3.3 
No surface water abstraction points have been identified within the 
Project Site boundary. 
9.3.4 
A small area of the Project Site towards the Afon Llan lies in area 
known to have flooded in the past. Lower lying parts of the Project Site 
may be susceptible to groundwater flooding.  A burst of the watermain 
flowing through the Project Site is a potential source of flooding.

9.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
9.4.1 
There are not anticipated to be any significant residual effects on the 
main water bodies resulting from the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection. Most effects predicted to be neutral or Slight 
adverse and therefore not significant. 
9.4.2 
Although the Project Site is at low risk from flooding, an event such as 
a burst watermain may cause damage to the Power Generation Plant.  
This may therefore result in a major adverse effect due to the sensitivity 
of the receptor, which would therefore be significant. 
9.4.3 
Mitigation measures to reduce the effects on groundwater and surface 
water features, such as the Afon Llan and its tributaries, will include 
settlement ponds, directional drilling techniques, careful siting of 
stockpiles and implementation of Sustainable Drainage Systems. 
9.4.4 
There is no discernable difference between Access Option 1 and 2 at 
this stage in terms of impacts on water quality and resources.  
10 
GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITION AND HYDROGEOLOGY 
10.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology. To date, a desk-based assessment and site 
walkover has been undertaken to assess any potential impacts upon 
geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology from the proposed 
Project. A summary of the results from this preliminary assessment is 
provided below. 
10.2 
Assessment Methodology 
10.2.1 
The study area for this topic is an area up to 1 km from the Project Site 
boundary.  A site walkover was undertaken in July 2014 in order to 
identify potential sources of contamination, and potential receptors 
which may be adversely affected by the presence of contamination. 
10.2.2 
The baseline conditions, including the identification of previous land 
uses, were determined with reference to a variety of sources, include 
consultation with the Coal Authority. 
10.2.3 
The assessment of risk is a three stage process commencing with a 
Preliminary 
Risk 
Assessment 
which 
comprises 
a

10.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors   
10.3.1 
Historical uses of the Project Site include agriculture, a gravel pit, a 
colliery and an inert landfill.  A Coal Authority Mining Report indicates 
that they have received no indication of the risk of the land being 
affected by subsidence. 
10.3.2 
The permeability of the bedrock geology ranges from low to high, 
depending on the degree of fracturing.  The superficial deposits located 
across the Project Site comprise predominantly glacial till.  There are 
also pockets of alluvium and peat present within the Project Site 
boundary. 
10.3.3 
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding 
the Project Site is poor quality agricultural land (Grade 4). 
10.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
10.4.1 
The construction and decommissioning works associated with the 
Power Generation Plant, such as ground disturbance and potential 
pollution incidents, will not result in significant effects.  Effects will range 
between Neutral and Slight adverse.   
10.4.2 
The construction of both the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
will result in the temporary sterilisation of agricultural land, and other 
potential mineral resources.  These effects will be neutral and therefore 
not significant. 
10.4.3 
There is the potential for a Moderate adverse, and therefore significant, 
effect resulting from ground instability on the Power Generation Plant, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.  This may affect any built 
structures during construction and operation. 
10.4.4 
Comprehensive Ground Investigation work will be carried out prior to 
construction of the Project to mitigate the potential effects described 
above. 
10.4.5 
There is potential for a Slight adverse, and therefore not significant, 
effect resulting from disturbance and remobilisation of existing 
contamination pathways to receptors through earthworks with Option 1.  
The effect of Option 2 is likely to be Neutral.  
11 
LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL IMPACTS 
11.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon landscape character and 
resources, designated landscapes, registered parks and gardens, 
recreational interests, and visual amenity. To date, a Zone of

11.2 
Assessment Methodology 
11.2.1 
A mixture of desk study and field work has been undertaken to identify 
and record the character of the landscape and the elements, features 
and aesthetic and perceptual factors. The Study Area for visual effects 
is set at 15 km.

11.2.2 
The computer-generated Zone of Theoretical Visibility indicates areas 
from which it might be possible to see part or parts of the Project. It has 
been compiled using topographical data and a model of the Project, 
assuming the highest point of the Generating Equipment will be the 
stack (between 35 and 40 m high). 
11.2.3 
Viewpoints have also been agreed with Swansea Council to represent 
the most visually sensitive locations.  Photomontages will be prepared 
for some of the locations to illustrate the effects of the Project. 
11.2.4 
The use of Landscape Character Assessments is also an important 
element of establishing the current baseline and potential forces for 
change.  LANDMAP has been used for this assessment, which is the 
national information system for Wales. 
11.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
11.3.1 
The nearest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is the Gower 
AONB which is physically remote from the Project Site and visually 
separated from the Project Site by intervening topography. The Project 
will also not be visible from the Brecon Beacons National Park. 
11.3.2 
Fields within and around the Project Site are medium to small and 
irregularly shaped, divided by combinations of hedge banks, low walls, 
and ditches. The Project Site is situated in the low lying parts of the 
Afon Llan Valley and consists of very gently sloping land. The Project 
Site is contained from the north, east and west by local topography and 
vegetation. Local roads are visually contained by high hedge banks. 
The M4 corridor and the northern suburbs of Swansea dominate the 
southern area, with more remote hill landscape to the north and east. 
11.3.3 
The Project Site and surroundings include a number of overhead lines 
as shown in Figure 11.1.

11.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
11.4.1 
The expectation is that the main visually prominent element of the 
Power Generation Plant will be the 40m high stacks, which represents 
a maximum height and therefore the worst-case scenario. These 
vertical elements are expected to have significant adverse effects on 
some viewpoints during construction and operation, as well as the 
landscape character of the Project Site.  However, much of the Project 
Site itself will be screened by existing vegetation and local topography 
and this will reduce the visual effects of the main generators. 
11.4.2 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are predominantly 
underground and are not expected to have significant effects during 
construction and operation other than where there is above ground 
infrastructure. 
11.4.3 
There is no discernable difference between Access Option 1 and 2 at 
this stage in terms of impacts on landscape character and visual 
amenity.

TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
12.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon the local transport network. To 
date, a preliminary assessment has assessed the local road network to 
identify any potential impacts upon the road network from the proposed 
Project. A summary of the results from this preliminary assessment is 
provided below. 
12.2 
Assessment Methodology 
12.2.1 
The assessment has established the existing capacity conditions 
around the Project Site and assessed network and corridor 
performance in relation to a number of receptors.  This is based on 
data collected on site and existing data. 
12.2.2 
The ES will present the findings of trip estimates from the Project, the 
mode split of all trips, and the likely distribution across the transport 
network. Forecasting of baseline traffic data will be carried out to 
establish a realistic worst case scenario for a future year. 
12.2.3 
An assessment of pedestrians, cyclists and other non-motorised users 
of the transport network will also be undertaken. 
12.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
12.3.1 
The B4489 lies west of the Project Site and runs north-south linking 
Felindre to Llangyfelach and is marked with a 40 mph speed limit. 
North of the access to the National Grid’s Swansea North electrical 
substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station, the B4489 is a 
narrow rural road. It then widens to a single carriageway road for the 
rest of its length, with the stretch leading to the junction with the A48 
having two lanes south-bound. 
12.3.2 
The Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road is an unclassified road which runs east and 
north of the Project Site, from Pant-lasau to Rhyd-Y-Pandy in an almost 
directly north-south direction. There are several other private roads in 
proximity to the Project Site, all of which are rural in nature. 
12.3.3 
Access Road Option 1 would use the Rhyd-y-pandy Road to access 
the site and Option 2 would use the B4489 to access the site. 
12.3.4 
An initial review of accident data shows that between 2009 and 2012, 
there was one accident on the Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road. This was a slight 
accident involving two vehicles and with one casualty. There were also 
several accidents along the B4489 within this time period, however,

none within close proximity to the Project Site or potential access 
routes.  
12.3.5 
There is no pedestrian footway or cycling infrastructure provision along 
the Access Road route options. There is one bus route in the vicinity of 
the Project Site, although there are several other bus routes that pass 
through nearby villages. There are no train stations or railway 
infrastructure in close proximity to the Project Site. 
12.4 
Preliminary Assessment 
12.4.1 
It is estimated that construction and decommissioning will result in 
approximately 200 car or van trips per day and around 150 HGV 
deliveries per day during the peak construction/decommissioning 
period. This assumes a 22 month construction period with the peak of 
HGV deliveries occurring during the first quarter of construction and the 
peak of car and van trips occurring during the fifth quarter of 
construction. The car or van trips would be limited to the start and end 
of the working day whilst HGV trips would be spread across the day.  
12.4.2 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection, there are anticipated to be Slight to 
Moderate effects resulting from traffic increases, which therefore may 
or may not be significant.  There will be Slight effects resulting from 
obstruction by abnormal loads which will therefore not be significant.  
These effects are likely to be similar for either access option. 
12.4.3 
Decommissioning is likely to cause the same effects as that of 
construction, but goods are taken away from site rather than to site. 
The decommissioning stage will generate fewer vehicle movements, as 
it is likely that the Gas Connection will be left in situ.  
12.4.4 
During operation, it is anticipated that approximately three people 
would be present on site during each shift. With three shifts per day, 
this would equate to 18 two-way car trips. 
12.4.5 
There are likely to be neutral effects during the operation of the Project 
as operational staff numbers will be low (approximately nine full time 
employees) and the delivery and removal of goods to the Project Site 
are also expected to be very low. Maintenance vehicles are expected to 
be very infrequent and are not anticipated to cause any detriment to the 
local transport network.

ARCHAEOLOGY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE 
13.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon heritage assets. To date, a

desk-based assessment and site walkover has been undertaken to 
assess any potential impacts upon heritage assets from the proposed 
Project. A summary of the results from this preliminary assessment is 
provided below. 
13.2 
Assessment Methodology 
13.2.1 
A Desk Based Assessment (DBA) has been undertaken in consultation 
with Cadw.  It included searches of records held by the Royal 
Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments, Swansea Historic 
Environment 
Record, 
aerial 
photographs, 
historic 
mapping, 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation. 
13.2.2 
Searches have been limited to 1 km from the Project Site for 
archaeology as the Project has the potential to impact on 
archaeological remains within the Project Site and the immediate 
surroundings only. 
13.2.3 
The Setting Assessment considers those designated Heritage Assets 
within a 5 km from the Project Site.  This assessment considers effects 
on the setting of Scheduled Monuments, Listed Buildings, Registered 
Parks and Gardens, World Heritage Sites and non-designated but 
important buildings. 
13.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
13.3.1 
No designated Heritage Assets have been identified within the Project 
Site. 30 designated Heritage Assets and 47 Grade II Listed Buildings 
have been identified within 5 km of the Project Site. Five non-
designated Heritage Assets have been identified within the Project Site.

Preliminary Assessment 
13.4.1 
At this preliminary stage of the assessment, it has been determined 
that there will be a neutral effect upon the setting of Heritage Assets 
within 5 km of the Project Site resulting from the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant. The effects will 
therefore be not significant.

There is the potential for adverse effects upon the standing remains of 
Abergelli Colliery resulting from damage to the asset by construction 
traffic using Access Road Option 1.  These effects are likely to be 
neutral, and therefore not significant, if the building is protected.  
13.4.3 
There is also potential for adverse effects upon a possible ancient field 
boundary if the Gas Connection is routed through the asset, although 
these effects will not be significant. However, these effects will be 
limited by implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, such as 
a programme of recording, which will be devised in consultation with 
the Planning Archaeologist. 
13.4.4 
There will neutral effects resulting from the operation of the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection which will therefore be not 
significant.

SOCIO-ECONOMICS 
14.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon the labour market and tourism. 
To date, a desk based assessment has been undertaken to assess any 
potential socio-economic impacts from the proposed Project. A 
summary of the results from this preliminary assessment is provided 
below. 
14.2 
Assessment Methodology 
14.2.1 
The socio-economic assessment is based on drive time catchment 
areas from the Project.  The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30-minute 
drive time, ‘wider area’ within a 45-minute drive time, and ‘wider region’ 
within a 60-minute drive time.    
14.2.2 
The tourism assessment is focussed on the area defined by a 15 km 
radius from the Project.  Facilities or notable points of focus of visitor 
attraction within this area have been reviewed.  Any significant tourism 
facilities located just outside the boundary have also been included.

14.2.3 
As proximity is likely to be the main determinant of impacts and their 
scale, the status (or catchment) of community facility receptors in an 
area determines the scale and significance of any effects. 
14.2.4 
The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using 
standard indicators relating to the economic/labour market, tourism, 
social and policy context.  The assessment has considered impacts on 
jobs and Gross Value Added. 
14.2.5 
A business survey has been carried out to gain a more detailed 
understanding of the local tourism economy and its current 
performance.  Businesses contacted include key visitor accommodation 
providers, leisure activity providers and other relevant tourism 
businesses. 
14.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
14.3.1 
The 
socio-economic 
study 
area 
surrounding 
the 
Project 
is 
characterised by; an increasing population; projected population 
increase of c.6% between 2013 and 2021; a growing retirement age 
population; an economic activity rate higher than the UK average; 
slightly higher levels of unemployment comparable to the UK average; 
a slightly higher proportion of people working in manufacturing; a 
comparable proportion of people working in the construction sector;   a 
higher proportion of people employed in semi-skilled/unskilled jobs and 
lower proportion of people in highly skilled jobs; and a higher proportion 
of people achieving no qualifications and low level qualifications 
compared to the UK average. 
14.3.2 
Domestic visitor tourism spending and bed-nights are at their highest 
level since 2006-08.  Visitor trips, despite falling recently, remain high 
and above average.  Overseas tourism appears to be declining in 
Swansea.  Overseas trips, bed-nights and spending are at their lowest 
level since 2006. 
14.3.3 
Two of the top ten visitor attractions in South West Wales are within the 
tourism study area. 
14.3.4 
An initial audit of community facilities indicates the provision of: 21 
schools within three miles of the Project Site; five GP surgeries; one 
hospital; six pharmacies; and one library. The level of existing 
community infrastructure is considered to be sufficient to accommodate 
additional demand.

Preliminary Assessment 
14.4.1 
No significant labour market, tourism and recreation, and community 
infrastructure adverse effects are anticipated during construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project given there is an 
availability of skilled, construction labour with a 60-minute drive time 
and there will be limited increased demand on community 
infrastructure.  
14.4.2 
There is no discernable difference between Access Option 1 and 2 at 
this stage in terms of impacts on the labour market, tourism and 
community infrastructure.   
15 
OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
15.1.1 
Each topic chapter where effects may result that may affect human 
health i.e. noise, air quality and ground conditions (potential land 
contamination) will consider those potential effects in the ES. 
15.1.2 
Electric and Magnetic Fields have been considered in the preliminary 
assessment, but will not be subject to further assessment since the 
Electrical Connection will be buried underground and therefore adverse 
effects are unlikely to occur. 
16 
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS 
16.1.1 
The findings of the preliminary assessment have concluded that there 
are unlikely to be any adverse cumulative effects in addition to those 
likely to result from the development of the Project when it is 
considered in combination with the following developments.  This will 
be reviewed in more detail in the full EIA as it is an on-going 
assessment. 
 
Planning Application 2013/1221 – Installation of 16 wind 
turbines at Mynydd y Gwair; 


The inter-relationship of effects of the Project on receptors identified in 
the PEIR i.e. more than one effect on the same receptor, will be 
considered as part of the full EIA.

SUMMARY 
17.1.1 
The preliminary assessment as described in the PEIR has identified the 
following potential significant residual effects resulting from the Project: 
 It is considered unlikely that there will be permanent residual 
effects associated with the construction of the Project relating to 
air quality. The effects relating to construction activities are all 
temporary. 
 During construction it is anticipated that there will be some 
increases in traffic and some disruption to the road network 
during off peak times.  These effects will all be temporary as 
there will be limited traffic during operation of the Project. 
 Where views of the stacks are possible these are unlikely to be 
mitigated by planting and adverse effects on visual amenity are 
likely to occur.   
 The risk of flooding is low.  However, should it occur, such as 
from a burst watermain, the effects may be significant due to the 
possible damage to the Project or harm to workers that may 
occur. 
17.1.2 
The adverse effects of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
will be similar to the Power Generation Plant during construction.  
During operation the effects will be limited as both will be underground. 
17.1.3 
The main differences between the two access options is that Option 2 
will result in permanent habitat loss, Option 1 will have a wider impact 
on the road network, as it is longer, and may also impact on a non-
designated heritage asset without mitigation. 
17.1.4 
As the design and EIA are completed, the Applicant will seek to identify 
further mitigation and design measures to seek to reduce the significant 
adverse effects where appropriate.
