CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
In 2017 we made significant progress with the strategy we announced in December 2016. 
First, we completed the acquisition of Opus Energy – a leading challenger brand in the UK Small and Medium-
sized Enterprise (SME) energy market; second, we acquired a third biomass pellet plant (LaSalle Bioenergy), 
which significantly increases our pellet production capacity; and third, we continued to develop options for flexible 
gas generation at four sites around the UK. 
We also began developing longer-term options for growth, with the exploration of coal-to-gas repowering at Drax 
Power Station, as we look to provide new sources of flexible generation backed up by long-term capacity 
contracts. To support our strategy, we completed a refinancing in May and announced a new dividend policy in 
June. 
At the same time, we have continued to provide a significant amount of the UK’s renewable electricity. With 
confirmation of Government support for further biomass generation at Drax Power Station we plan to continue 
our work to develop a low cost solution for a fourth biomass unit conversion, allowing us to provide even more 
renewable electricity, whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer. 
Opus Energy performed well, delivering on the plans we set out at the time of acquisition and, in North America, 
LaSalle Bioenergy is successfully commissioning. This performance alongside safety, sustainability and 
expertise in our core markets acts as a strong base from which the business can grow and deliver long-term 
sustainable value. 
We have a major role to play in supporting the UK energy system, as it becomes increasingly ambitious in 
decarbonising the electricity sector and subsequently transport and heating. In doing so, through our flexible, 
low-carbon and customer-focused approach we aim to deliver higher quality earnings, with a reduction in 
commodity exposure alongside opportunities for growth. 
Our people – employees and contractors – remain a key asset of the business. Their safety remains at the centre 
of our operational philosophy and we have performed well in this regard, although we continue to work to improve 
our performance across the Group. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND 
EBITDA in 2017 of £229 million was significantly ahead of 2016 (£140 million). This increase was principally 
from producing high levels of renewable power from sustainable biomass. We also benefited from our growing 
B2B Energy Supply and Pellet Production businesses. Through these activities we are improving the visibility of 
our earnings. 
In June we announced a new dividend policy. This policy is to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected 
to grow as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash 
flows. In determining the rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of contracted cash flows, the 
less predictable cash flows from the Group’s commodity based business and future investment opportunities. If 
there is a build-up of capital the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to 
shareholders.  
At the 2017 half year results we confirmed an interim dividend of £20 million (4.9 pence per share) representing 
40% of the full year expected dividend of £50 million (12.3 pence per share) (2016: £10 million, 2.5 pence per 
share). Accordingly, the Board proposes to pay a final dividend in respect of 2017 of £30 million, equivalent to 
7.4 pence per share. 
In addition, the Board has decided to announce today a £50 million share buy-back programme, which will take 
place during 2018, which is consistent with our capital allocation policy.  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In September, Dorothy Thompson CBE announced her intention to stand down as Group Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO). I would like to thank Dorothy for her enormous contribution to the Group over the last 13 years. During 
her tenure Dorothy led the transformation of the business and leaves the Group in a strong position with a clear 
strategy that lays the foundations for further success in a changing energy sector. 
Dorothy is succeeded by Will Gardiner, who was previously Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a key 
architect of the strategy. His appointment follows a thorough review of internal and external candidates and is a 
natural progression after two years working alongside Dorothy developing a strategy which I am confident will 
create significant benefits for all Drax’s stakeholders. 
A process to appoint a permanent CFO is underway and Den Jones has been appointed as Interim CFO. Den 
is highly experienced, having previously served as CFO of both Johnson Matthey and BG Group. Drax remains 
committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Board and its committees play an active role 
in guiding the Company and leading its strategy. We greatly value the contribution made by our Non-Executive 
Directors (NEDs) and during a time of transition their role is especially important. 
We indicated last year that we were seeking additional NEDs with experience in sustainability and energy supply 
to complement our already experienced Board. I am therefore delighted to welcome two new NEDs to the Drax 
Board. Firstly, David Nussbaum, whose in-depth knowledge of sustainability will support our continued focus in 
this area and secondly, Nicola Hodson; whose experience in technology, business transformation and energy, 
will provide real value as the Group delivers its strategy. 
OUR PEOPLE 
As the Group grows I would also like to welcome colleagues from Opus Energy and our other developments. 
On-boarding is proceeding well and by working together in our common goal to help change the way energy is 
generated, supplied and used, we are creating real value for all stakeholders. 
I must thank all the employees and contractors who have worked so hard to help the Group succeed in the last 
12 months. It is through their skill, expertise and hard work that we are able to deliver our strategy for the 
business. 
My sincere thanks to colleagues for their commitment and hard work. 
It only remains for me to say that your Board remains totally committed to the complementary aims of delivering 
sustainable long-term value for the Group, and of helping our country build a low-carbon economy.

CHAIRMAN 
 
 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
MARKET BACKGROUND 
The UK is undergoing an energy revolution – a transition to a low-carbon economy requiring new energy 
solutions for power generation, heating, transport and the wider economy. Through our flexible, lower carbon 
electricity proposition and business to business (B2B) energy solutions, the Group is positioning itself for growth 
in this environment. 
OUR STRATEGY 
Our purpose is to help change the way energy is generated, supplied and used. 
Through addressing UK energy needs, and those of our customers, our strategy is designed to deliver growing 
earnings and cash flow, alongside significant cash returns for shareholders. 
Our ambition is to grow our EBITDA to over £425m by 2025, with over a third of those earnings coming from 
Pellet Production and B2B Energy Supply to create a broader, more balanced earnings profile. We intend to pay 
a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders. Progression towards these targets is underpinned by safety, 
sustainability, operational excellence and expertise in our markets. 
SUMMARY OF 2017 
We made significant progress during 2017, but were below our expectations on the challenging scorecard targets 
we set ourselves in pellet production and biomass availability, the latter reflecting the significant incident we 
experienced on our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2017, which extended into January 2018. 
Energy Supply performed well with Opus Energy in line with plan and Haven Power exceeding its targets. 
Through a combination of this performance and the progress of our strategy we have delivered EBITDA of £229 
million, significantly ahead of 2016 (£140 million) and with each of our three businesses contributing positive 
EBITDA for the first time. 
On a statutory basis we recorded a loss after tax of £151 million, which reflects unrealised losses on derivative 
contracts and the previously announced accelerated depreciation on coal-specific assets as well as amortisation 
of newly-acquired intangible assets in Opus Energy. We also calculate underlying earnings, a profit after tax of 
£2.7 million, which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts to assess the 
performance of the Group without the income statement volatility introduced by non-cash fair value adjustments 
on our portfolio of forward commodity and currency futures contracts. 
During the year we refinanced our existing debt facilities, reducing our debt cost. We also confirmed a new 
dividend policy which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend (£50 million in respect of 2017), consistent 
with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth. At year end our net debt was £91m 
below our 2x net debt to EBITDA target, providing additional headroom.  
In the US, our Pellet Production operations recorded year-on-year growth in output of 35%, with our first two 
plants now producing at full capacity. During the second half of 2017 we also completed the installation of 
additional capacity enabling our Morehouse and Amite facilities to handle a greater amount of residue material, 
supporting efforts to produce good quality pellets at the lowest cost. 
As part of our target to expand our biomass self-supply capability we completed the acquisition of LaSalle 
Bioenergy (LaSalle) adding pellet production capacity. LaSalle commenced commissioning in November 2017 
and due to its close proximity to our existing US facilities, once complete, will provide further opportunities for 
supply chain optimisation. 
As in 2016, we benefited from the flexibility of self-supply. This often overlooked attribute of our supply chain 
enables us to manage biomass supply across the Power Generation business’ planned outage season and to 
benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the short-term spot market. 
In Power Generation, we experienced a significant incident on our biomass rail unloading facilities, including a 
small fire on a section of conveyor. We fully investigated the incident and following repairs over the Christmas 
period have now recommissioned the facility, with enhanced operating procedures. This is a timely reminder of 
the combustible nature of biomass and the need for strong controls and processes to protect our people and 
assets. 
Our biomass units continued to produce high levels of renewable electricity from sustainable wood pellets for 
the UK market – Drax produced 15% of the UK’s renewable electricity – enough to power Sheffield, Leeds, 
Liverpool and Manchester combined. In doing so, we are making a vital contribution to the UK’s ambitious targets 
for decarbonisation across electricity generation, heating and transport – an 80% reduction by 2050 vs. 1990 
levels. 
We benefited from the first year of operation of our third biomass unit under the Contract for Difference (CfD) 
scheme which provides an index-linked price for the power produced until March 2027. The unit underwent a 
major planned outage between September and November, with a full programme of works successfully 
completed. 
The flexibility, reliability and scale of our renewable generation, alongside an attractive total system cost, means 
we are strongly placed to play a long-term role in the UK’s energy mix. To that end we continue to see long-term 
biomass generation as a key enabler, allowing the UK Government to meet its decarbonisation targets and the 
system operator to manage the grid. 
The UK Government recently confirmed support for further biomass generation at Drax Power Station and we 
now plan to continue our work to develop a low cost solution for a fourth biomass unit, allowing us to provide 
even more renewable electricity, whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer. 
Our heritage is coal, but our future is flexible lower-carbon electricity. We are making progress with the 
development of four new standalone OCGT plants situated in eastern England and Wales and our work to 
develop options for coal-to-gas repowering with battery technologies. These options would be supported by 15-
year capacity market contracts, providing a clear investment signal and extending visibility of contract-based 
earnings out to the late 2030s. 
In B2B Energy Supply, we completed the acquisition of Opus Energy, a supplier of electricity and gas to 
corporates and small businesses. The transaction completed in February 2017 and the business has continued 
to operate successfully within the Group, achieving its targets and making an immediate and significant 
contribution to profitability. Alongside this good performance we have also implemented the operational steps 
necessary to realise further operational benefits of the acquisition, and we now source all of Opus Energy’s 
power and gas internally. 
Haven Power delivered a strong performance with the sale of large volumes of electricity to industrial customers. 
Through our customer focus and efficiencies, margins have improved and the business generated a positive 
EBITDA for the first time. 
Together, our B2B Energy Supply business now has over 375,000 customer meters, making it the fifth largest 
B2B power supplier in the UK. We are delivering innovative low-carbon power solutions, with 46% of our energy 
sold from renewable sources. As the power system transforms, we will be working closely with our customers to 
help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power. We see this as a significant 
opportunity for the Group in the medium to long term. 
In October 2017 we completed the sale of Billington Bioenergy (BBE) to Aggregated Micro Power Holdings 
(AMPH). Consideration for the transaction was £2.3 million, comprised of £1.6 million of shares in AMPH and 
£0.7 million of cash. 
The sale of BBE is aligned with our strategy to focus on B2B energy supply. However, through our shareholding 
in AMPH, we will retain an interest in the UK heating market, whilst gaining exposure to the development of 
small-scale distributed energy assets. 
POLITICAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 
We continue to operate in a changing environment. The full impact of the UK’s decision to leave the EU is still 
unknown. 
The immediate impact on the Group was a weakening of sterling and an associated increase in the cost of 
biomass, which is generally denominated in other currencies. Through our utilisation of medium-term foreign 
exchange hedges the Group protected the cash impact of this weakness. In 2017, sterling has generally 
strengthened, and we have been able to extend our hedged position out to 2022 at rates close to those that we 
saw before Brexit. 
In terms of UK energy policy, the Government’s main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of 
domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff (SVT) contracts. SVT’s are not a common feature of the 
B2B market. At the microbusiness end of this market, which is closer in size to domestic, most of our customers 
are on fixed price products and are active in renewing contracts. 
The UK Government’s response to its consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 has confirmed 
an end to non-compliant coal generation by October 2025. We believe our assets, projects and ability to support 
our customers’ electricity management will support the Government’s ambition to maintain reliability when coal 
generation ceases. 
Running a resilient, reliable grid is not simply about meeting the power demand on the system; there are also 
system support services which are essential to its effective operation. As the grid decentralises and becomes 
dependent on smaller, distributed generation the number of plants able to provide these services is reducing. 
Biomass generation, our proposed OCGTs and our repowering project would allow us to meet these needs, but 
this will not come for free. A reliable, flexible, low carbon energy system will require the right long-term incentives. 
In November 2017, the Government confirmed that the UK will maintain a total carbon price (the combined UK 
Carbon Price Support – CPS – and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme – EU ETS) at around the 
current level. CPS has been the single most effective instrument in reducing the level of carbon emissions in 
generation and we continue to support the pricing of carbon, a view echoed in a report prepared for the UK 
Government by the leading academic Professor Dieter Helm.  
(http://www.biee.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/Cost_of_Energy_Review.pdf)) 
Against this backdrop we continue to make an important contribution to the UK economy. According to a study 
published by Oxford Economics in 2016 (www.Draximpact.co.uk), Drax’s total economic impact – including our 
supply chain and the wages our employees and suppliers’ employees spend in the wider consumer-economy 
was £1.7 billion, supporting 18,500 jobs across the UK. 
 
SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY AND PEOPLE 
The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is vital to the Group, with safety at the center 
of our operational philosophy. We also recognise the growing need to support the wellbeing of our employees 
and their mental health. 
During the year we continued to use Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) as our primary KPI in this area. 
Performance was positive, at 0.27, but we expect this to improve in the coming year. 
The incident at our biomass rail unloading facilities in December did not lead to physical injuries but was 
nonetheless a significant event and caused disruption into 2018. We consequently launched an incident 
investigation to ensure our personal and process safety management procedures are robust. 
To promote greater awareness around wellbeing we have embedded this in our new people strategy and expect 
to focus more energy and resources on this important area during 2018. 
Strong corporate governance is at the heart of the Group – acting responsibly, doing the right thing and being 
transparent. As the Group grows the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and recognising the 
importance of strong corporate governance, we will publish a comprehensive overview of our sustainability 
progress in 2017 on our website (www.drax.com) when we publish our Annual report and accounts. We have 
also completed the process which allows us to participate in the UN Global Compact (UNGC) – an international 
framework which will guide our approach in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. 
During 2017 we published our first statement on the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in compliance 
with the UK Modern Slavery Act. We have added modern slavery awareness to our programme of regular training 
for contract managers and reviewed our counterparty due diligence processes. 
We have continued to maintain our rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability, ensuring the wood 
pellets we use are sustainable, low-carbon and fully compliant with the UK’s mandatory sustainability standards 
for biomass. The biomass we use to generate electricity provides a 64% carbon emissions saving against gas, 
inclusive of supply chain emissions. Our biomass lifecycle carbon emissions are 36g CO2/ MJ, less than half the 
UK Government’s 79g CO2/ MJ limit. 
Our people are a key asset of the business. Through 2017 we developed a new people strategy. The strategy 
focuses on driving performance and developing talent to deliver the Group’s objectives. We have established 
Group-wide practices, including a career development and behaviour framework focused on performance and 
personal development. 
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION 
A key part of our strategy is to identify opportunities to improve existing operations and create options for long-
term growth. To that end we have established a dedicated Research and Innovation (R&I) team led by the Drax 
engineers who delivered our world-first biomass generation and supply chain solution. 
We are actively looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our operations, notably in our biomass supply chain. 
Biomass is our largest single cost and as such we are focused on greater supply chain efficiency and the 
extraction of value from a wide range of low value residue materials. 
In B2B Energy Supply we are using our engineering expertise to help offer our customers value-adding services 
and products which will improve efficiency and allow them to optimise their energy consumption.

OUTLOOK 
Our focus in 2018 remains on the delivery of our strategy and long-term ambitions for earnings growth, 
underpinned by safety, sustainability, operational excellence and expertise in our markets. We also recognise 
that being the most efficient operator in each of our markets is a key factor in our success. 
Our objective in Pellet Production remains the commissioning of LaSalle, the production of good quality pellets 
at the lowest cost, cross-supply chain optimisation and identifying attractive options to increase self-supply. 
Our biomass proposition is strong – reliable, flexible, low-carbon renewable electricity and system support which, 
combined with an effective fuel hedging strategy, will provide long-term earnings visibility. We remain focused 
on ways to increase supply chain efficiency and make biomass competitive beyond 2027. As part of this we 
remain focused on the optimisation of our assets in the US Gulf and reduction in pellet cost. To support this 
focus we are moving our US headquarters from Atlanta to Monroe Louisiana, which benefits from a much closer 
proximity to these assets. 
In Power Generation, we continue to explore ways to optimise our existing operations, whilst meeting the needs 
of the changing UK electricity system. 
We remain supportive of the UK Government’s decarbonisation targets and will continue our work to deliver four 
OCGTs and a low cost biomass unit conversion utilising existing infrastructure at Drax Power Station, alongside 
developing the option to repowering the remaining coal units to gas. 
In B2B Energy Supply, we will continue to grow our B2B offering, with significant opportunities to grow market 
share. At the same time, we will invest in supporting infrastructure to ensure we can continue to grow, offer 
market leading digital propositions and smart metering services. 
We have made good progress on the delivery of our strategy and will continue to build on this as we progress 
our targets for 2025, whilst playing an important role in our markets and helping to change the way energy is 
generated, supplied and used.

GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW 
INTRODUCTION 
The Group’s performance for 2017 was significantly improved from 2016, with EBITDA of £229 million (2016: 
£140 million). This principally reflects contributions from recently acquired Opus Energy and the operation of a 
biomass unit in Power Generation under a CfD. This was delivered alongside a well-supported refinancing, a 
positive result for the Pellet Production business and good operational performance. 
Profit before tax was adversely impacted by higher depreciation (£13 million), which included the previously 
announced accelerated depreciation of coal-specific assets, one off costs associated with the Opus Energy 
acquisition (£8 million) and the refinancing (£24 million), as well as amortisation of newly acquired intangible 
assets in Opus Energy (£37 million). Non-cash unrealised losses on derivative contracts in the period of £156 
million (2016: profit £197 million), principally a result of foreign exchange rate movements, materially affected 
the result and led to a loss before tax of £183 million for the period. 
The underlying profit performance, which excludes the volatility of open derivative contract valuations and 
associated tax charges and one off transaction costs, resulted in underlying earnings of £2.7 million, as shown 
in note 7 to the financial statements. 
The financial structure of the business has changed over the year and the Group benefits from increasingly 
visible and growing earnings from a broader base, with reducing exposure to commodity prices, and strong cash 
generation potential. We expect the CfD will provide high quality earnings through the life of the contract (to 
March 2027), supported by growing contributions from expanding Pellet Production operations and B2B Energy 
Supply. 
On 10 February 2017 we completed the acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy) or total 
consideration of £367 million. The acquisition was funded from the Group’s own resources and £200 million from 
an acquisition facility and resulted in £159 million of goodwill and £224 million of intangible assets (see note 13 
to the financial statements). 
The Group is supported by a strong balance sheet, strengthened in the period by the refinancing and 
restructuring of the Group’s debt and a continued focus on working capital and cash optimisation. Net debt was 
£367 million at 31 December, increased from £93 million in 2016, largely driven by debt funding drawn to finance 
the acquisition of Opus Energy. However, continued focus on working capital and cash optimisation resulted in 
net debt at 1.6x EBITDA at the end of the year. 
The results for 2017 demonstrate clear progress with the Group’s strategy. Positive contributions were made 
from across the Group, the balance sheet was restructured and investment targeted in areas with the potential 
to deliver strong returns. This provides an excellent platform from which to increase shareholder value. 
INCOME STATEMENT 
REVENUE 
Consolidated revenue for 2017 of £3,685 million was £735 million greater than 2016, driven by higher Power 
Generation sales and the acquisition of Opus Energy. 
Electrical output from Power Generation of 20.0TWh was in line with our plan, 65% from biomass units and 35% 
from coal units. This included the impact of maintenance outages for two biomass units and the impact of low 
load factors on coal units during the summer. 2017 saw the first year of generation under the CfD, contributing 
£248 million of revenue. 
Revenues from system support services and the business’ ability to respond flexibly to grid demands grew during 
the year, contributing £88 million (2016: £47 million). The revenues available from flexibility recognises the value 
of the Drax Power Station plant in an increasingly volatile and intermittent generation market. 
Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) revenues, recognised when we sell ROCs to third parties, of £368 
million were recorded during the year (2016: £362 million). 
B2B Energy Supply revenues increased from £1,326 million in 2016 to £1,999 million in 2017. This included 
contributions from Opus Energy (from 10 February) and included sales of gas, a key contributor to revenues 
over the winter period. 
Revenues of our US-based Pellet Production business continued to rise, as we increased production from 
607,000 tonnes in 2016 to 822,000 tonnes in the year. Revenues are based on sales of pellets from the US to 
our Power Generation business, based on an arms-length contract. Volumes included 18,000 tonnes of 
commissioning production from our new plant at LaSalle Bioenergy. 
GROSS MARGIN 
Consolidated gross margin for 2017 of £545 million (2016: £376 million) was primarily derived from our 
generation and supply activities. 
Power Generation delivered £398 million of gross margin from biomass units operating under a CfD and the 
ROC regime and coal units providing system support. ROCs continue to form a key component of financial 
performance and the expected benefit of ROCs earned is recognised as a reduction in our biomass fuel costs at 
the point of generation. Each ROC is subsequently recognised as revenue when that ROC is sold to a third party. 
We earned ROCs, reducing costs, with a total value of £481 million in 2017 (2016: £536 million) as CfD replaced 
ROC generation. 
B2B Energy Supply gross margin improved from £24 million in 2016 to £117 million in 2017, with positive 
contributions from Haven Power and Opus Energy. Electricity sales were supplemented, for the first time, with 
gas sales by Opus Energy.  
Pellet Production gross margin relies on pellet sales and close control over production and operating costs. 
Increasing volumes and stable costs allowed margins to improve to £39 million during the year and deliver a 
positive EBITDA contribution for the first time. 
Further segmental financial performance data is provided in note 2 to the financial statements. 
OPERATING COSTS 
Operating costs of £316 million increased from the previous year (2016: £236 million). This increase largely 
reflected the addition of Opus Energy to the Group and the expansion of the Pellet Production business. 
Operating costs in Power Generation included a major planned outage on one of the biomass units. 
Central costs for 2017 were £34 million, compared with £21 million in 2016. The increase reflected investment 
in strategy, innovation and development activities, the majority of which is not expected to be recurring. 
We incurred transaction costs of £8 million during the year (2016: £nil), supporting the delivery of strategic 
options, including the acquisition of Opus Energy. Transaction costs were also incurred as part of the disposal 
of Billington Bioenergy to Aggregated Micro Power Holdings plc on 31 October. These costs were all one off in 
nature, related to asset acquisitions and disposals, and were therefore excluded from EBITDA. 
EBITDA 
As a result of the financial performance described above, consolidated EBITDA for 2017 was £229 million, 
compared to £140 million in 2016. 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION 
Depreciation of £123 million in the year was £13 million higher than 2016, largely driven by the acceleration of 
charges following the shortening of useful economic lives for certain coal-specific assets and including write off 
of obsolete assets. We assume that assets which are only able to support coal-fired generation will not operate 
beyond 2025, in line with the Government’s declared intention to cease unabated coal generation, resulting in 
accelerated depreciation charges between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2025. 
Amortisation charges of £44 million included £37.5 million relating to intangible assets arising from the Opus 
Energy acquisition. These assets totalled £224 million and were comprised of customer contracts, brand value 
and software, as shown in note 13 to the financial statements. Charges in the year also include the impact of 
reclassifying software assets in use across the Group as intangible assets, following investment in new systems 
capability. 
UNREALISED LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS 
A key component of the Group’s risk management strategy is the use of forward contracts to secure and de-risk 
the future cash flows of the business. Whilst these contracts are all entered into for risk management purposes, 
a proportion of our portfolio is not designated into a hedge accounting relationship under IFRS. Where this is the 
case, the unrealised gains and losses arising from the change in fair market value of these contracts is 
recognised in our income statement. 
In 2017, we recognised unrealised losses of £156 million (2016: gain £177 million) within the income statement 
in respect of outstanding contracts for future delivery. This was recorded below EBITDA and excluded from 
underlying earnings. In our balance sheet a similar loss of £209 million (2016: gain £330 million) was recognised 
in the hedge reserve. The losses, which do not impact cash, principally relate to forward foreign currency 
purchase contracts designed to fix the Sterling cost of future purchases of biomass. The majority of our fuel 
purchases are denominated in US dollars, with the remainder in Canadian dollars and Euros. The losses reflect 
the change in value of our hedge as Sterling has strengthened against the US and Canadian dollar during the 
year. The strengthening in sterling during 2017 partially reversed the significant mark to market gains posted 
during 2016 as its value fell following the Brexit vote. 
In addition to hedging foreign currency commitments we also forward purchase, as required, coal, oil, gas and 
carbon. An increase to oil prices during 2017 drove an unrealised gain from forward contracts for these 
commodities, which partially offset the unrealised losses on forward foreign exchange purchases. 
Despite the loss in the year the Group continues to benefit from the hedging programme, securing medium-term 
fuel costs and other liabilities. 
The term of our hedges is limited by available credit lines and market liquidity. We have hedges in place to cover 
anticipated exposures until 2022, beyond which there is a risk that the cost of our fuel purchases will materially 
increase. We remain very focused on reducing the long- term cost of biomass fuel to preserve gross margins 
beyond the current currency hedge period. 
EBIT 
Loss before interest and tax (Operating loss) fell from a profit of £204 million in 2016 to a loss of £117 million in 
2017, influenced by the items described above, a loss on disposal of Billington Bioenergy (£4m), but principally 
reflecting the volatility in the unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. The impact of movements on 
derivative contracts is excluded in the calculation of underlying earnings (see below). 
NET INTEREST CHARGES 
Net interest charges of £66 million include costs incurred as a result of the Group’s refinancing. This includes 
acceleration of deferred financing costs and the one-off cost of early repayment charges for loans outstanding 
at the refinancing date (£24 million), in addition to interest costs driven by a higher quantum of debt than the 
previous year. A full breakdown of interest payable is shown in note 5 to the financial statements. 
PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE AND AFTER TAX 
The Group’s loss before tax, calculated in accordance with IFRS, was £183 million for 2017, compared to a profit 
of £197 million for the previous year. The reduction predominantly reflects improvements to EBITDA, offset by 
higher depreciation and amortisation and unrealised losses on forward foreign currency purchase contracts. 
The net tax credit for 2017 of £32 million compares to £3 million in 2016. It includes two one-off items arising in 
the year. 
Firstly, a tax credit of £13 million arising from a patent relating to biomass was granted to the Group in late 2016. 
Under the UK Patent Box tax regime, this enables the Group to pay corporate taxes at a lower rate on profits 
which arise from the use of the innovation. We have agreed the claim with HMRC for prior years 2013 to 2016 
(£10 million) and have included our best estimate of the benefit arising under the tax regime for 2017 (£3 million). 
However, for accounting purposes our best estimate is made of the benefit arising under the tax regime from 
2013 to 2017. 
Offsetting this credit is a non-cash deferred tax charge of £16 million arising from the reduction in US Federal 
tax rates to 21% from 1 January 2018. 
Applying the tax credit results in a loss after tax of £151 million (2016: £194 million) and a basic loss per share 
of (37.2) pence (2016: earnings of 47.7 pence). 
UNDERLYING EARNINGS 
Underlying profit (also referred to as underlying earnings) is used to assess the performance of the Group without 
the P&L volatility caused by derivative contracts and any other material, one-off items. The reconciliation of IFRS 
earnings to underlying earnings is shown in note 7 to the financial statements. 
Underlying profit before tax for 2017 of £5 million reduced from £21 million in 2016, reflecting higher EBITDA 
offset by higher depreciation, amortisation and interest charges. 
The underlying tax charge for the year of £2 million (2016: £nil) excludes the tax effect of non-underlying 
translations. 
Underlying profit after tax for the year was £3 million (2016: £21 million), resulting in underlying EPS of 0.7 pence 
per share (2016: 5.0 pence per share). 
FINANCIAL POSITION 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE 
The Group has a disciplined approach to capital expenditure, with all projects subject to review by investment 
committees and large projects requiring Board approval. Investment is prioritised to address safety and 
regulatory requirements, ensure plant is fully maintained and fit for purpose, and only released to enhancement 
projects where incremental returns have been identified. 
Capital expenditure in the year was £181 million, increased from £97 million during 2016. This included the 
purchase, at auction, of the pellet-production assets at LaSalle Bioenergy and investment to recommission the 
plant and achieve throughput of 450k tonnes of wood pellets per annum. In total the LaSalle investment was £48 
million. Details are shown in note 2 to the financial statements. 
At Drax Power Station investment reflected routine asset replacement and upgrades (£62 million), including the 
purchase of strategic spares, and payments to secure development options for four OCGT power plants. 
In B2B Energy Supply the development of a new information technology platform and preparations for Smart 
meters adoption added £9 million and an office facility was purchased in Northampton (£17 million), which will 
be used to consolidate existing Opus Energy operations from four offices into a single facility, enhancing 
operational effectiveness. 
CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS 
Cash generated from operations was £315 million in 2017, an increase of £125 million from the previous year. 
Key drivers were the improvement in EBITDA and cash inflows generated from working capital management. 
Working capital management included use of a committed facility to manage receivables in our B2B Energy 
Supply business, providing cash in advance of normal payment terms.  
A cash inflow was also generated from ROC sales. Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after 
the ROC is earned however, we have optimised our trading activities to enable us to accelerate the cash flows 
over a proportion of these assets. This provided a £142 million cash benefit during 2017. In 2016, three 
uncommitted ROC facilities were used to accelerate ROC receivables, these were unused at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £111 million). 
The net cash outflow for the year was £6 million (2016: £95 million inflow), after cash payments for capital 
expenditure of £159 million (2016: £93 million) and dividend payments of £22 million (2016: £11 million). Cash 
taxes paid during the year were £14 million (2016: £2 million). 
 
NET DEBT AND FUNDING 
The cash position of the Group during the year was significantly impacted by a full Group refinancing, which was 
executed on 5 May 2017. The Group successfully raised £550 million of publicly traded bonds, supported by a 
revised revolving credit facility and indexed loan notes totalling £350 million. The newly raised funds were used 
to repay the £200 million Opus Energy acquisition facility. The remaining funds will provide support for the 
Group’s investment and strategic programmes. 
The use of the receivables facility and ROC sales mentioned above accelerated cash flows to a value of £110 
million (2016: £74 million) with a corresponding reduction to net debt. We expect to continue to use the 
receivables facility throughout 2018. In addition we expect to maintain the flexibility to accelerate ROC cash flows 
through optimising our trading activities or through uncommitted ROC receivable facilities. 
The Group also has access to secured trading lines, available with certain counterparties, providing support to 
the trading programme. 
Net debt at 31 December 2017 was £367 million, an increase of £273 million from 31 December 2016 (£94 
million). 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and maintaining an appropriate credit rating. Cash optimisation 
contributed to achieving a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 1.6x at 31 December and we remain focused on further 
reductions, supported by improved cash generation. 
Further information on funding arrangements is included in note 11 to the financial statements. 
PENSIONS 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme in each of its operating companies and, in addition, 
the Power Generation business operates a defined benefit scheme within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme 
framework. The triannual valuation for this scheme (dated 31 March 2016) completed during the year, resulting 
in an agreement with the Trustees for the Company to make deficit repair contributions, totaling £52 million, from 
1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025. The agreement also establishes a legally binding journey plan, involving 
the deficit contributions, improved investment returns and liability reductions, targeting financial self-sufficiency 
for the scheme by 2025. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
ACQUISITION OF OPUS ENERGY GROUP LIMITED 
On 6 December 2016 we announced the proposed acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy), a 
well-established and proven B2B energy supply business serving the SME market, for consideration of £340 
million cash, plus locked box interest. 
The acquisition was partly financed by a short-term debt facility of up to £375 million, of which £200 million was 
initially drawn down and then repaid during the year. 
The proposed acquisition was approved by shareholders at a general meeting on 8 February 2017 and 
concluded on 10 February 2017, with Drax obtaining control of Opus Energy at that date. Opus is expected to 
deliver enhanced margins to Drax’s energy supply business and drive our growth in the SME market. The 
business made a positive contribution to performance during 2017. 
Financial information on the assets and liabilities acquired, plus an assessment of the impact of the acquisition 
on our financial statements, is provided in note 13 to the financial statements. 
IMPACT OF BREXIT 
We have continued to monitor the progress of the UK’s Brexit negotiations and the potential impact on the Group. 
Whilst we continue to expect limited impact on our operations, any associated sterling weakness may influence 
the future cost of fuel used by the Power Generation business. To manage this risk a number of financial 
instruments, including FX options, were added to the foreign exchange hedging programme during the year, 
effectively capping future FX liabilities on an additional proportion of the future foreign currency fuel exposures. 
 
DISTRIBUTIONS 
On 15 June we announced a new dividend policy, consistent with maintaining the Group’s credit rating and 
investing in its business. As part of this announcement the Board expected to recommend a dividend of £50 
million with regard to the 2017 financial year, with growth expected in future years. 
The Board is confident that this level of dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow from this level as the 
implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In 
determining the rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and 
the less predictable cash flows from the Group’s commodity-based businesses. If there is a build-up of capital 
the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders. 
At the Annual General Meeting on 13 April 2017, shareholders approved payment of a final dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 of 0.4 pence per share (£1.6 million). The final dividend was subsequently paid on 12 
May 2017. 
On 18 July 2017, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2017 of 4.9 
pence per share (£20 million), representing 40% of the expected full year dividend. The interim dividend was 
paid on 6 October 2017. 
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, on 25 April 2018, the Board will recommend to shareholders that a 
resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence 
per share (£30 million), payable on or before 11 May 2018. 
Shares will be marked ex-dividend on 19 April 2018. 
In addition, in line with our capital allocation policy, the Board has agreed to undertake a £50m share buy back 
programme during 2018 to return cash to our shareholders.  
 
 
VIABILITY STATEMENT 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a period significantly longer than the 12 months required by the going concern provision. 
The assessment of viability was led by the Group Chief Executive and Interim Chief Financial Officer in 
conjunction with divisional and functional management teams and presented to the Board. In reviewing this 
assessment the Board has considered the principal risks faced by the Group, relevant financial forecasts and 
sensitivities, the availability of adequate funding and the strength of the Group’s control environment. 
ASSESSMENT PERIOD 
The Board conducted this assessment over a period of three years, which was selected for the following reasons: 
– 
The Group’s Business Plan, which is reviewed and assessed on a quarterly basis and is used for strategic 
decision making, includes a range of financial forecasts and associated sensitivity analysis. This Plan 
covers a three-year period in detail.  
– 
Within the three-year period liquid commodity market curves and established contract positions are used 
in the forecasts. Liquid curves typically cover a one to two-year window and contracts cover periods 
between one and ten years. In particular, we benefit from the stable and material earnings stream available 
from the CfD until 2027. Selecting a three-year period balances short-term market liquidity against our 
longer term contractual positions.  
– 
Within a three-year horizon there is limited certainty around markets and regulatory regimes. However, in 
selecting this period the Board has assumed no material changes to the Group’s mid-term regulatory 
environment and associated support regimes.  
REVIEW OF PRINCIPAL RISKS 
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties have been considered over the period. 
The principal risks with the potential to exert significant influence on viability are: commodity price changes, 
political and regulatory changes, biomass acceptability changes and plant operating failures. A significant 
adverse change to the status of each risk has the potential to place material financial stress on the Group.  
The risks were evaluated, where possible, to assess the potential impact of each on the viability of the Group, 
should that risk arise in its unmitigated form. The potential inputs were included, where appropriate, as 
sensitivities to the Plan and considered by the Board as part of the approval process required before the Plan 
was adopted by the Group. 
In this regard, the Group has a proven track record of adapting to changes to its environment and deploying 
innovative solutions to protect financial performance. Recent developments suggest that this will continue in the 
future as the Group invests in new plant, equipment and systems and broadens the business in line with the 
strategy. 
REVIEW OF FINANCIAL FORECASTS 
The Plan considers the Group’s financial position, performance, cash flows, covenant compliance and other key 
financial ratios and was most recently updated to reflect current market and external environment conditions in 
December 2017. It is built by business and segment, and includes growth assumptions appropriate to the 
markets each business serves. 
The Plan includes certain assumptions, the most material of which relate to commodity market price curves and 
levels of subsidy support available to the Group through the generation of biomass-fueled renewable power. It 
is underpinned by the stable revenues available through the generation of CfD-backed electricity and sales to 
B2B Energy Supply customers. 
The Plan is subject to stress testing, which involves the construction of reasonably foreseeable scenarios, 
including those aligned to the principal risks, which test the robustness of the Plan when key variables are flexed 
both individually and in unison. Where such a scenario suggests a risk to viability, the availability and quantum 
of mitigating actions is considered. 
The Board considers the most significant of these scenarios in the assessment period to be a significant 
deterioration of commodity market prices, leading to a fall in the available price for power and thus a fall in the 
margins available to the Group from power generation and supply activities. This impact would however be 
partially mitigated through the earnings stability provided by the CfD and a reducing reliance on commodity price-
dependent earnings. Based on its review the Board is satisfied that in such a scenario sufficient actions could 
be taken to preserve the viability of the Group. 
AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FUNDING 
The sources of funding available to the Group are set out in note 11 to the financial statements. The Board 
expects these sources, along with cash flows generated by the Group from its normal operations, to provide 
adequate levels of funding to support the execution of the Group’s Plan. 
Refinancing of the Group’s debt facilities during the year, and in particular the placement of a new bond facility, 
has provided the Group with enhanced facilities and the ability to access debt markets, should that need arise 
during the viability assessment period. 
EXPECTATIONS 
The directors have considered all the factors in their assessment of viability over the next three years, including 
the latest Plan, scenario analysis, levels of funding, control environment and the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group. The directors have also considered the availability of actions within their control in the event 
of plausible negative scenarios occurring. They have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment. 
 
 
 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
We manage the commercial and operational risks faced by the Group in accordance with policies approved by 
the Board. We have reviewed the principal risks and consider they are broadly unchanged from the previous 
year. 
The Board is responsible for defining risk appetite and ensuring the effectiveness of risk management and 
internal controls across the Group. The Group has a comprehensive system of governance controls to manage 
key risks. 
GROUP APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT 
The effective identification and management of risk across the Group is integral to the delivery of our strategy. 
The Group has a Risk Management Policy, approved by the Board, which defines the Group’s approach to risk 
management. The key elements of the policy are as follows: 
– 
identify principal risks that threaten the achievement of our strategic objectives then assess their 
significance to the business;  
– 
put in place appropriate mitigating controls to manage identified risks to an acceptable level;  
– 
escalate and report principal risk and control information to support management decision making;  
– 
assign responsibility and define accountabilities for risk management and put these into practice across the 
Group;  
– 
continuously monitor the changing risk environment, the Group’s principal risks, the effectiveness of 
mitigation strategies and the application of the risk framework.  
The approach manages rather than eliminates the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and provides 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES 
The risk management governance structure includes seven business risk management committees (RMCs). 
Each RMC: 
– 
reports to the executive management of that area, assisting in the management of their risks. In turn, each 
executive is responsible for their risks to the Group Executive Committee with responsibility for ensuring 
that all risks associated with their specific area of the business are identified, analysed and managed 
systematically and appropriately. This includes new and emerging risks and changes to existing risks. New 
risks are also identified during development of the Business Plan.  
– 
has terms of reference that require local level risk policies and control systems to be approved, 
implemented and monitored in order to ensure that activities are commensurate with the risk appetite 
established by the Board, are adequately resourced and comply with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.  
The Group Executive Committee and the Board review reporting on risks from each RMC and from Group Risk. 
In addition, the Audit Committee reviews the suitability and effectiveness of risk management processes and 
controls on behalf of the Board. 
INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Group has a comprehensive and well-defined internal control system with clear structures, delegated 
authority levels and accountability. The Board has adopted a Schedule of Matters which are required to be 
brought to it for decision. The internal control system is designed to ensure that the directors maintain full and 
effective control over all significant strategic, financial and organisational issues. 
Through the Audit Committee, the Board has implemented a programme of internal audits of different aspects 
of the Group’s activities. The programme is developed based on an assessment of the key risks of the Group, 
the existing assurance and controls in place to manage the risks and the core financial control framework. 
The results of each internal audit are documented in a report for internal distribution and action. A full copy of 
the report is distributed to the Group Executive Committee and the Chair of the Audit Committee, with an 
executive summary going to the other members of the Audit Committee. Each report includes management 
responses to Internal Audit’s findings and recommendations and an agreement of the actions that management 
will take to improve the risk management and the internal control framework. In addition to the results of work 
undertaken by Internal Audit, the Audit Committee also satisfies itself that an action plan is in place and 
management are addressing issues raised by the external auditor in their yearly management letter. 
Based on the reporting from the RMCs and from the Audit Committee in 2017, the Board determined that it was 
not aware of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal control. 
 
 
CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE 
Risks are reported to the Board and disclosed in the Annual report and accounts under eight principal risk 
headings. These are unchanged from 2016.

1. Strategic risks 
Context 
The Group has a strategy 
designed to strengthen the 
long-term future of the Group. 
The strategy includes: 
– 
Higher quality, diversified 
earnings and management 
of commodity market 
exposure by increasing 
contractual and non-
commodity related 
earnings and;  
– 
Targeted long-term growth 
opportunities with priority 
on post 2027 earnings and 
creating new opportunities 
in all the markets in which 
we operate.  
Risk and impact 
– 
Development of the four 
OCGT plants acquired in 
2016 and re-powering of 
coal units to gas with 
battery storage option is 
dependent on winning 
contracts with acceptable 
returns in capacity market 
auctions which is uncertain.  
– 
Post 2027 biomass 
generation dependent upon 
cost of generation relative 
to market prices.  
– 
Biomass self-supply 
requires acquisition and/or 
expansion in order to 
achieve the 30% self-
supply target. Acquisition 
opportunities are 
dependent on willing 
vendors or distressed 
plants coming to market.  
– 
The energy markets in 
which we operate are 
 – Continue work on 
reducing projects costs to 
increase competitiveness 
in the capacity market 
auction; a disciplined 
approach to the auction 
means such projects will 
only go forward upon 
obtaining a 15-year 
capacity market contract 
(‘CM’ contract) which 
meets our hurdle rate.  
– Continued work on cost 
reductions from biomass 
supply and generation 
efficiency to support post 
2027 operations.  
– We continue to actively 
pursue potential 
acquisitions of pellet plant 
facilities and evaluate the 
case for expansion of 
existing facilities.  
– We continually analyse 
the changing dynamics of 
the markets in which we 
operate. A programme of 
product incubation to 
bring new energy services 
to market and 
research/development 
into new technologies is 
in place.

 – Acquisition of Opus 
Energy and integration 
into the Group provides 
support to diversification 
of earnings.  
– Acquisition and start of

CM contracts.  
evolving at a rapid pace 
with new entrants 
competing with existing 
players in both Power 
Generation and B2B 
Energy Supply. 
2. Political and regulatory 
risks 
  
  
  
Context 
We remain vulnerable to 
changes in government policy 
at UK and EU level. The 
energy sector is subject to 
detailed legislation and 
regulation that is frequently 
changing as the economy 
decarbonises and 
decentralises and is ever more 
stringent. Regulation and 
compliance generally 
applicable to businesses is 
also increasing with a trend 
towards transparency and 
accountability. 
Risk and impact 
– 
Changes to UK policy and 
regulations may reduce our 
ability to deliver our 
forecast earnings from our 
base business and our 
growth strategy putting 
pressure on our financial 
results and cash flows.  
– 
More complex and 
challenging regulations 
increase the potential for 
non-compliant outcomes, 
regulatory investigation and 
sanctions.  
 – Engagement with 
politicians across the 
political spectrum and 
Government officials to 
influence thinking.  
– Communication of our 
socio-economic value to 
the UK.  
– Working with think tanks 
and specialist consultants 
to establish Drax as a 
thought leader on priority 
policy and regulatory 
issues.  
– Engagement with 
regulators to influence 
strategic direction of, and 
ensure compliance with, 
regulatory requirements.  
– Working with Energy UK 
to identify market 
improvements, enhance 
competition and develop 
voluntary codes of 
practice.  
– Regulatory and 
compliance programmes 
in place proportionate to 
the risk of non-
compliance. Key 
programmes include 
compliance with the 
Criminal Finances Act 
2017 and the General 
Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and 
associated data 
protection laws.  
 
= 
 – The Government has 
confirmed the Carbon 
Price Floor will remain in 
place and at its current 
level until the end of coal 
generation in the power 
sector (by 2025).  
– The Government has 
unveiled a successor to 
the Levy Control 
Framework to monitor the 
cost of subsidies and 
confirmed no new funding 
commitments until 2025.  
– Brexit continues to create 
uncertainty over UK 
participation in, and 
influence over, 
discussions on new EU 
legislation.  
– The Government has 
published a Bill to 
introduce a price cap for 
domestic power retailers; 
we remain vigilant to the 
risk this could be extended 
to some SMEs.  
– The smart meter roll out 
continues and the 
obligation to install a smart 
meter for every customer 
(where reasonable steps 
have been exhausted) 
remains.  
– Many ancillary services 
require policy, regulatory 
and market change to 
ensure generators are 
suitably compensated for 
these services.  
– Ofgem is reviewing the 
way in which network 
businesses are 
remunerated, which will 
impact network charging 
and access rights for 
generators and demand 
users.  
– New Data Protection Bill 
announced due to Brexit 
to ensure the UK is 
regarded as an “approved 
country” to continue to 
process EU citizen 
personal data.  
– The introduction of the 
Markets in Financial 
Instruments Directive 2 
(MiFID2) increases the 
regulatory requirements 
placed on businesses 
participating in non-
physical commodity 
markets.  
3. Biomass acceptability 
risks 
  
  
  
Context 
The biomass market is still 
relatively new, sustainability 
legislation at both an EU and 
UK level and public 
understanding of the benefits 
of the technology are evolving. 
Risk and impact 
– 
EU or UK sustainability 
policy changes could be 
excessively onerous and 
make it difficult for us to 
comply with policy 
requirements and claim 
subsidy in support of 
economic biomass 
generation.  
– 
Detractors and some 
eNGOs try and influence 
policymakers against wider 
biomass use and future 
biomass conversions, 
which could make it difficult 
to gain support for further 
conversions.  
 – Increased engagement 
across all European 
Institutions (Commission, 
Parliament, Council), and 
relevant UK Government 
departments.  
– Strong coalition with other 
utilities and those 
engaged in forest 
industries including using 
EU and US forestry 
expertise to brief 
Brussels.  
– Increased transparency in 
how we evidence 
sustainability.  
– Working with academics, 
think tanks and specialist 
consultants to improve 
understanding and 
analysis of the benefits of 
biomass.  
– Engagement with key 
NGOs to discuss issues 
of contention.  
– Media, including social 
media, presence to 
respond in the public 
domain to eNGOs.  
 
= 
 – EU consultation on the 
next version of the 
Renewables Energy 
Directive, including the 
sustainability requirements 
for biomass. 
– Forging closer 
relationships with 
suppliers on sustainability 
through the supplier 
relationship programme.  
– Strong processes to 
ensure compliance with 
regulation.  
4. Plant operating risks 
  
  
  
Context 
 
The reliability of our operating 
plant is central to our ability to 
create value for the Group. 
 
Risk and impact 
 
– 
Single point failures of 
plant and incidents arising 
from the handling and 
combustion of biomass 
could result in forced 
outages in our generation 
or pellet production plants. 
 
– 
Successful generation 
using biomass requires 
stringent quality throughout 
the supply chain, which 
continues to evolve and 
mature. Poor quality could 
result in unplanned loss of 
generation. 
 – Robust management 
systems designed to 
mitigate risk. 
 
– Comprehensive risk-
based plant investment 
and maintenance 
programme. 
 
– Stringent safety 
procedures in place for 
handling biomass and 
dust management. 
 
– Plant designed to prevent 
and control major 
hazards. 
 
– Significant research and 
development on the 
production of wood 
pellets as well as the 
handling and burning of 
biomass. 
 
– Adequate insurance in 
place to cover losses from 
plant failure where 
possible. 
 
– Full testing of all biomass 
supplies prior to 
acceptance and the use 
of contractual rights to 
reject out of specification 
cargoes. 
 
– Sampling and analysis 
through the supply chain 
to increase understanding 
of causes of fuel quality 
issues. 
 
= 
 – Acquisition and start of 
commissioning of LaSalle 
Bioenergy plant. 
5. Trading and commodity 
risks 
  
  
  
Context 
The margins of our Power 
Generation and B2B Energy 
Supply businesses are 
influenced by commodity 
market movements, which are 
inherently volatile. 
Risk and impact 
– 
Fluctuations in commodity 
prices, particularly gas and 
power, could result in lower 
margins and a reduction in 
cash flow in our generation 
business.  
– 
Drax Power may fail to 
secure future grid system 
services contracts which 
are a source of revenue 
diversity for the Group.  
– 
The value of ROCs 
generated may be lower 
than forecast if the recycle 
value outturns below BEIS’ 
projections due to higher 
than anticipated renewable 
generation.  
 – High levels of forward 
power sales for 2018 and 
a CfD for one generation 
biomass unit.  
– Hedging energy supply 
commodity price 
exposures when fixed 
price sales are executed 
with third parties.  
– Wood pellets purchased 
under long-term contracts 
with fixed pricing.  
– Significant forward foreign 
exchange hedging in 
place.  
– Hedging fluctuations in 
ROC generation from 
wind farms through 
weather derivatives.  
 
= 
 – Sterling exchange rates 
against the euro and dollar 
remain weak.  
– Power prices remain low 
with increased volatility in 
short-term prices.  
– Prices for wood pellets 
increased as oversupply 
reduced.  
– Opus Energy’s supply to 
smaller customers, 
including gas, increases 
commodity exposure 
relating to weather 
impacts on demand 
patterns.  
6. Information systems and security risks 
  
  
Context 
The availability, integrity and 
security of our IT systems and 
Company data are essential to 
support operations of the 
Group. 
Risk and impact 
– 
Non-availability of IT 
systems, or a breach in 
their security, could result 
in the inability to operate 
systems or our information 
could be compromised.  
– 
If our IT architecture does 
not meet the increasingly 
demanding and complex 
requirements of the Group, 
we may not deliver our 
growth plans effectively.  
 – Business continuity, 
disaster recovery and 
crisis management plans 
in place across the 
Group.  
– Cyber security measures, 
including a defence, 
detect, remedy strategy, 
in place.  
– IT transformation 
programme in place to 
deliver upgraded 
architecture.  
 
 
< 
 – Significant investment in 
our critical IT systems has 
improved the general 
resilience of the core 
systems.  
– Implementation of the IT 
transformation 
programme.  
7. People risks

performance and focusing 
on talent. This is placing 
greater onus on 
performance, learning, 
equitable treatment and 
consistency in approach 
across the Drax Group. 
8. Environment, health and safety risks 
  
  
Context 
 
The health and safety of all our 
employees, contractors and 
visitors is of paramount 
importance to us. We believe 
that a safe, compliant and 
sustainable business model is 
critical to the delivery of our 
strategy and crucial for 
sustained long-term 
performance. Safety is at the 
heart of our operational 
philosophy and we continue to 
work across the Group to 
maintain high standards and a 
culture of safe working. 
Compliance with environmental 
legislation and our 
environmental permits and 
consents is essential to ensure 
the long-term future of the 
business.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), set out in FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
– 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
– 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  
– 
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and  
– 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.  
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: 
– 
properly select and apply accounting policies;  
– 
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;  
– 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; and  
– 
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
– 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;  
– 
the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and  
– 
the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.  
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of directors on 26 February 2018 and is signed on its 
behalf by:

The Group received shares with a value of £1.6 million as part-consideration for the disposal of Billington 
Bioenergy during 2017. The net cash disposed of in the transaction was negligible. There were no other non-
cash transactions in either the current or previous year. 
 
 
 
1 GENERAL INFORMATION & BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The consolidated financial information for Drax Group plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together, the 
Group) set out in this preliminary announcement has been derived from the audited consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 (the financial statements). 
This preliminary announcement does not constitute the full financial statements prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial statements were approved by the Board of 
directors on 26 February 2018. Statutory accounts for 2016 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies 
and those for 2017 will be delivered in due course. 
The report of the auditors on the financial statements was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by 
way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and did not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of 
the Companies Act 2006 or equivalent preceding legislation. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and 
therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IFRS Regulations and the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis, except 
for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out in the 2017 
Annual report and accounts. These policies have been applied consistently to both years presented. 
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central 
corporate office providing certain specialist and shared functions. Our businesses are: 
– 
Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK, including at Drax Power Station and the 
development of OCGT projects; 
– 
Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the 
US; and 
– 
B2B Energy Supply: the supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK. 
The operating segments have been renamed to align more closely with the strategy, but are consistent with the 
prior year, except for changes due to business combinations as noted below. Each business is an operating 
segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of 
assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments. The 
measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA. 
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that 
segment. Corporate office costs are included within central costs. 
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited (see note 13), 
an energy supply business providing electricity and gas to business customers. Its activities are closely-related 
to those of the existing B2B Energy Supply business and the B2B Energy Supply management structure has 
been reorganised to integrate Opus Energy into the existing structure. Financial results are reported to the 
Board for the larger combined business. Accordingly, this new acquisition forms part of the B2B Energy Supply 
segment in the year ended 31 December 2017. Note 13 details the additional revenue and profit attributable to 
the Group from the new acquisition. 
The Group sold its interest in Billington Bioenergy in the year. The B2B Energy Supply segment includes £6.3 
million of revenue and £0.2 million EBITDA losses in respect of this business for the 10-month period to the 
date of disposal.

Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions. 
The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and 
liabilities are the same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial 
statements. The external revenues and results of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality with 
higher dispatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £175 million (2016: £93 million). The 
increase in capital expenditure compared to the previous year principally reflects the acquisition of the LaSalle 
pellet plant and subsequent investment to bring the site into operation in the Pellet Production segment, and 
investment in office space for Opus Energy in the B2B Energy Supply segment. 
Intra-group trading 
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, equate to 
market prices at the time of the transaction. During 2017, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with 
a total value of £135.7 million (2016: £72.9 million) to the Power Generation segment and the Power 
Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of £1,033.4 million (2016: £868.2 million) 
to the B2B Energy Supply segment. 
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£9.8 million at 31 December 
2017), is eliminated on consolidation. Following the increase in output from Pellet Production during the year 
and reduced generation in Power Generation at the end of the year, intra-group stocks were higher at the end 
of 2017 than previously, resulting in an increase in this provision. 
Major customers 
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 does not include any amounts from individual customers 
(2016: amounts of £541.5 million and £399.3 million derived from two customers) that represent 10% or more 
of total revenue for the year. The Group’s largest two customers contributed 9% and 8% of total consolidated 
revenue respectively. These revenues arose in the Power Generation segment. 
3 REVENUE  
Accounting Policy 
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net 
of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies. 
Revenues from the sale of electricity from our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered 
output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable. 
Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK 
Government’s Renewables Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income 
statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the 
cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet. Revenue from sale of 
ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party. 
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD (see below) in the income statement, as a 
component of revenue, at the point the flow of economic benefit becomes probable. This is considered to be 
the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due. 
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through our B2B Energy Supply 
businesses, Haven Power and Opus Energy, is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract 
exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the 
receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon 
metered consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured 
or billed, the revenue is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is included 
as accrued income on the balance sheet. 
Other revenues derived from the provision of services (for example, the supply of system support services, 
such as black start and frequency response) to National Grid are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract. Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-
hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the amount of the 
contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in 
estimating probable future outcomes. 
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as 
ash and gypsum) are recognised at the point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, 
typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises. 
CfD payments 
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with The Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a 
Government-owned entity responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform 
Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched 
from a specific biomass-fueled generating unit. The payment is calculated with reference to a strike price of 
£100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK 
Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2017 was 
£106 per MWh. 
When market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an 
additional payment to/from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of 
dispatch and the strike price. Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in 
the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the relevant 
generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract. 
The year ended 31 December 2017 is the first full year of generation under the CfD contract, which 
commenced on 21 December 2016. 
ROC sales 
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme started 
in April 2002 and places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their 
electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable 
electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations under the 
RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced 
in April 2002. At 31 December 2017 we are in CP16. 
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The 
buy-out price was set at £30/ ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation. The buy-out price in CP16 is £45.58/ROC. 
ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically 
slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers 
paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators. 
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised 
of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the 
expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP.

4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT 
Accounting policy 
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units 
(CGUs)) whenever there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group 
assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. The Group considers the smallest collections of 
assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus 
Energy and Drax Biomass) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four CGUs. 
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is 
assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the 
continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset 
to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of recoverable amount is 
normally based on value in use. 
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved 
business plan and includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows 
from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. 
Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGU’s activities. 
Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities 
and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow 
hedges. 
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, 
nor the potential benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate 
of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable 
to the CGU in question. 
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is 
made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 14). 
Assessment of indicators of impairment 
The Group’s market capitalisation has remained below the carrying value of its net assets this year. As part of 
the most recent annual review, the Group considered this and concluded that a potential indicator of 
impairment existed in respect of the Drax Power CGU. This assessment was based upon continued weakness 
in commodity markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates, perceived levels of regulatory uncertainty and the 
sensitivity of the recoverable amount of Drax Power’s assets to changes in these factors. 
Accordingly, an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date. A 
review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment. 
Significant estimation uncertainty 
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon 
a number of assumptions. In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s estimates 
of future prices, output, costs, economic support for renewable energy generation and access to contracts for 
electricity generation and supply. Where relevant and to the fullest extent possible, the key assumptions are 
based on observable market information. However, observable market information is only available for a 
limited proportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review. 
Impairment review 
The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was £1,430 million. The value in use of the 
Drax Power CGU was tested using the Group’s established planning model. 
The analysis assumed that Drax Power’s three biomass-fueled generating units will continue in operation until 
the end of their estimated useful lives, currently considered to be 2039. In line with our assumption that coal-
fired generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the Government’s announced intention to close coal-fired 
generation following recent consultations, the three remaining coal-fired units were assumed to cease coal-
fired generation by this date but will then be available for conversion to alternative fuels. No account has been 
taken of any cash inflows that could result from such a conversion (which could take place earlier than 2025) in 
measuring the value in use of the Drax Power CGU. This includes potential cash flows arising from the fourth 
unit conversion to biomass and possible repowering of the fifth and sixth units to gas. 
The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating 
units and the regulatory regime under which they might operate. The key assumptions (i.e. those most 
sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome for impairment) are considered to be: 
– 
The expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above; 
– 
Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments, 
notably power prices and biomass prices; 
– 
Future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments; and 
– 
The continuance of existing biomass support regimes – CfD and RO – until 2027 and the existence of a 
favourable economic environment for biomass generation thereafter. This includes future Capacity 
Market and system support revenues. 
These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements. The historic volatility in these 
assumptions is reflected in the financial performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a 
reliable indicator of future values. 
Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third 
parties. Intra-group purchases of biomass are included at contract prices which are based on our view of future 
market prices. Transactions beyond contracted positions are valued using market data and forward price 
curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third party source, independent to the 
Group. In particular, longer-term power prices are based on assumptions from Aurora Energy Research. The 
contracted period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts expiring in 
2027. Beyond this point, estimated biomass prices are largely based on our internal models which reflect our 
assessment of future market prices. 
Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible. 
Beyond our contracted position, exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves. 
Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume 
these cease in 2027. The impairment analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these 
support mechanisms beyond this date. The biomass-fueled units that are assumed to continue to generate 
power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary services to the UK grid 
and an expectation that capacity market revenues will be available to these units. Our power price forecasts 
reflect increased volatility between peak and baseload prices. Assumed revenues from ancillary services and 
the capacity market are based on projections derived from current contracts and capacity market outcomes 
and how we expect the market to evolve. These assumptions reflect our expectation that Drax will be required 
to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of the UK’s energy mix 
throughout the life of the units. 
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 7.3%. The discount rate is 
supported by observable market reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and specific to the 
circumstances, of the Group and the Power Generation business. This indicated that the recoverable amount 
of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment were 
required. 
Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 
21% in market power prices, an increase in biomass prices of approximately 31%, or a depreciation of Sterling 
against the US dollar of approximately 24% throughout the 22-year term of the valuation would result in a 
recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount. Furthermore, the valuation 
includes cash flows for the period from 2027-2039 in line with the assumed useful economic lives of the assets. 
If the value from this period was removed in its entirety, it would not result in an impairment charge. The 
analysis does not consider the interaction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions 
simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any mitigating actions that could be taken should 
the changes referred to materialise. In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable change in the 
method of allocation would result in an impairment charge. 
 
5 NET FINANCE COSTS 
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our 
bonds) as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for 
reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives and net interest charged on the Group’s defined 
benefit pension scheme obligation. These are offset by interest income that we generate through efficient use 
of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds. 
On 5 May 2017, the Group refinanced its external debt. The resulting cost of £24.2 million (2016: £Nil) reflects 
the costs incurred to extinguish the existing debt together with the release of the related deferred borrowing 
costs. As described in note 7, these costs have been excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings. 
Further information about the new finance structure can be found in note 11.

Foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in interest arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances 
and investments denominated in foreign currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. Sterling 
strengthened against the US dollar and Euro during 2017, resulting in losses being recognised on assets the 
Group holds denominated in these currencies. 
6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION 
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on 
this year’s taxable profits (which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some 
cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay 
additional tax) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which 
reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and 
tax rules (reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits). The tax credit reflects the 
estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the 
movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income 
statement. 
Accounting policy 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in 
the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other 
years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts 
expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. 
Significant estimation uncertainty 
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and 
expenditure for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior 
experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax 
prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to 
losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other 
than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20%) of the 
assessable profit or loss for the year. Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the 
respective jurisdictions. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. In December 2017, US Tax Reforms were legislated and introduced a 
package of tax measures, including a reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21% from January 2018. 
This rate reduction has been reflected in the US deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017. We do not 
anticipate any other impact of the US Tax Reforms on the deferred tax balances. 
The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the loss before tax as follows:

The Group’s underlying effective tax rate is sensitive to the mix of operating results between our UK and US 
businesses and the tax rates which apply in those jurisdictions. However, as a result of the reduction in the US 
federal tax rates from 2018 to 21%, and tax relief now arising to the group from the UK Patent Box regime (see 
below). In the medium term we anticipate our group underlying effective tax rate to be marginally lower than 
the main rate of corporation tax in the UK. 
The adjustments in respect of prior periods principally relate to a Patent Box claim. Drax Power was granted a 
patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to 
manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company 
is now entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of 
that technology. The Company has agreed a claim with HMRC for tax relief covering the period from the patent 
application in 2013 to 2016 amounting to £10.4 million. In line with the policy intentions of IFRIC 23 
“Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, the Group has also recognised an estimated benefit from the tax 
regime for the financial year 2017 of £2.6 million (included in the ‘Other’ line in the table above).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise 
are shown separately in the balance sheet. 
Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £22.7 million in relation to start-up losses 
and other temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and 
reflecting continuing improvement in operational performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient 
profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset. 
7 UNDERLYING EARNINGS 
Following the announcement of the change in the Group’s dividend policy on 15 June 2017, there is no longer 
a link between underlying earnings and the calculation of distributions. We have continued to present 
underlying earnings, an alternative performance measure, to provide a consistent, comparable measure of the 
overall financial performance of the Group year on year. 
Underlying earnings is defined as profit after tax, as measured in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and material one-off items that do not reflect the underlying 
performance of the business. 
This note analyses the items which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from underlying 
earnings: 
– 
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts: calculated in accordance with IAS 39 on derivative 
contracts not designated into hedge relationships for accounting purposes but held for the purposes of 
de-risking future cash flows, excluded due to their inherent volatility which does not reflect current 
operational performance 
– 
Acquisition-related costs: material one-off costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of Opus 
Energy during 2017 
– 
Cost of debt restructure: material one-off costs incurred as part of the restructuring of the Group’s debt in 
May 2017 
– 
In 2016, deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences: a material one-off credit arising 
from the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the Pellet Production business.

8 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that is attributable to each 
ordinary share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings (profit after tax calculated in 
accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. 
Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under our 
employee share schemes), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated 
as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS. Underlying EPS is based upon underlying earnings as 
defined in note 7. 
The effect of potentially dilutive options on the weighted average number of shares in issue at the balance 
sheet date is shown below:

9 RETAINED PROFITS 
Retained profits are a component of our equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits we have 
generated over our lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit we have distributed to our shareholders. The

Distributable profits 
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained 
distributable profits and cash resources. 
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £222 million and the recent history of cash generation are 
shown in note 12. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate 
Limited. 
The Parent Company financial statements disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £230 
million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in 
accordance with the Group’s updated dividend policy for the foreseeable future. 
The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management 
actively monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves 
are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the parent company has access to these reserves. 
The Group’s new financing facilities (see note 11) place certain conditions on the value of dividend payments 
to be made in any given year. We expect to be able to make dividend payments, in line with our new policy, 
within these conditions for the foreseeable future.

11 BORROWINGS 
On 10 February 2017 the Group entered into a £375 million acquisition finance facility, of which £200 million 
was drawn and utilised in the purchase of Opus Energy (see note 13). This facility, along with the existing term 
loans at 1 January 2017, was repaid in full on 5 May 2017, when the Group undertook a refinancing exercise. 
The new financing structure consists of £550 million of high-yield publicly-traded bonds listed on the 
Luxembourg exchange. This includes £350 million 4.25% fixed rate notes and £200 million floating rate notes 
of 4.00% above LIBOR, which all mature in April 2022. 
On the same day the Group entered into a £350 million Facility comprised of a revolving credit facility (RCF) 
with a value of £315 million (2016: £400 million) and an index-linked term loan of £35 million. 
The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points 
over LIBOR. At 31 December 2017, the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value 
of £35.7 million (2016: 57.9 million). 
The Group also has access to a $25 million revolving 30 day facility in the US business. This facility was fully 
drawn down at 31 December 2017 and had a sterling equivalent value of £18.5 million at that date. 
The term loan was fully drawn at inception and remains fully drawn at 31 December 2017 (2016: term loans of 
£325 million fully drawn). 
The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it does have access to certain non-recourse trade 
receivable finance facilities as described on note 12 which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash flows. 
 
 
Accounting policy 
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, 
which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, 
debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any 
such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the 
calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the 
instrument. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred 
until the draw-down occurs.

The borrowings from the refinance exercise in May, including the term loan, the loan notes and the RCF are 
secured against the assets of a number of the Group’s subsidiaries, with the exception of the US subsidiary’s 
land and buildings. 
In addition, the Group has a secured commodity trading line, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of 
commodity trades without the requirement to post collateral and FX trading lines with certain banks. 
Counterparties to these arrangements are entitled to share in the security as described above. At 31 
December 2017, the value of security provided under these arrangements was £3.6 million (2016: £0.9 
million). 
The US revolving facility is unsecured.

Note: 
(1) During 2016 we closed out a number of in-the-money forward foreign currency purchase contracts with a 
total value of £14 million. As these contracts were designated into hedge accounting relationships under 
IAS 39, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement in the period the hedged transaction 
occurs. The net loss for 2017 includes £10 million of income in relation to the unwinding of this position, for 
which the cash was received in 2016.  
The Group has access to a facility that enables it to accelerate the cash flows associated with trade 
receivables arising from B2B Energy Supply sales on a non-recourse basis. The net cash benefit derived from 
this facility during 2017 was £110 million (2016: £74 million) and is recognised as a reduction in receivables in 
the table above. We estimate that approximately 30% of this cash would have been received in the ordinary 
course of business by 31 December 2017 had the facility not been in place. 
The Group also has access to similar non-recourse facilities to accelerate cash flows on ROC receivables. No 
ROC receivables have been sold through these facilities in 2017 (2016: net cash benefit of £111 million). The 
reduction in ROCs in the table above reflects reduction in the number of generation units that give rise to 
ROCs following the approval of the CfD contract for one of our biomass-fuelled units in December 2016, and 
the increase in ROCs sold during the year. 
13 ACQUISITIONS  
Accounting policy 
Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition 
date). The consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on 
the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and 
the profits of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition 
date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs in 
the transaction costs line. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. 
Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy) 
The acquisition of Opus Energy was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently 
completed on 10 February 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital on this date. 
Opus Energy is a well-established B2B energy supply business serving business customers principally in the 
SME market providing diversification of our Retail offering and a robust platform for growth in line with our 
strategy. Opus Energy has contributed positively to earnings and cash flow immediately following the 
acquisition. 
The purchase consideration was £340 million plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energy’s net 
assets from 31 March 2016 to the acquisition date. The total consideration of £367 million was funded by a 
combination of existing cash reserves (£167 million) and partial drawing of a £375 million acquisition facility 
(£200 million). This facility was repaid as part of the refinancing. 
Acquisition-related costs amounted to £7.8 million. 
Following a detailed exercise to review the assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, the fair values 
acquired were as follows: 
 
 
Opus

The revenue and results of Opus Energy from the date of acquisition to the year end were as follows: 
 
Income statement items for the period from 10 February to 31 December 2017 
 
Revenue 
610.7 
EBITDA

The figures above have changed from those disclosed in the Interim Financial statements published on 19 July 
2017. The Group has continued to review and align estimates for the B2B Energy Supply business. This 
process resulted in a number of remeasurements reducing the fair value of the net assets acquired by £4.4 
million, with a corresponding increase in goodwill. The values shown above are now final. 
Following the acquisition, the Group has been able to identify and measure the fair value of existing customer 
contracts, the Opus Energy brand and software. The assets will be amortised over their useful economic lives 
as follows: 
– 
Existing customer contracts 11 years (reducing balance) 
– 
Brand 10 years (straight line) 
– 
Software 3 years (straight line) 
The fair value measurement of the existing customer contracts requires assumptions to be made, in particular 
regarding margins on current customer contracts, future contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed 
contracts. The goodwill of £159 million recognised on acquisition is largely reflective of potential customer 
contracts and growth opportunities together with the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill is deductible 
for tax purposes. 
The financial assets acquired include £130 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables 
for energy supplied to customers. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered 
to be the contractual amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts 
as at the acquisition date was £20 million. 
Additional financial information 
The consolidated results of the Group, assuming Opus Energy had been acquired at the beginning of the year, 
would show revenue of £3,775.7 million (compared to reported revenue of £3,685.2 million), EBITDA of £231.6 
million (compared to the reported EBITDA of £228.9 million) and a loss after taxation of £149.0 million 
(compared to reported loss after taxation of £151.1 million). This information includes the revenue and profits 
made by Opus Energy between 1 January 2017 and 10 February 2017, without accounting policy alignments 
and/or the impact of fair value uplifts resulting from acquisition accounting adjustments. This information is not 
necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the acquisition 
actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group. 
14 GOODWILL 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the 
assets acquired. During 2017, we recognised additional goodwill on the purchase of Opus Energy (see note 
13), and wrote off goodwill of £3.8 million in respect of Billington Bioenergy following the sale of the business. 
Accounting policy 
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it 
relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed. The table below shows movements and balances:

Goodwill 
Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017 was £170 million, with £11 million 
arising on the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and £159 million arising 
on the acquisition of Opus Energy in the year attributed to the Opus Energy CGU. 
The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value 
in use calculation using the Group’s established planning model. The elements reflected in this calculation are 
the same as those used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 
2017 and are disclosed in note 4. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using 
a growth rate of 1%. 
The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was £23 million. The expected future 
cash flows of the CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (calculated based on 
independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk factors 
affecting the Group’s B2B Energy Supply business). We believe that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-
established B2B Energy Supply business. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, 
was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. 
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2017 was £366 million, including intangible 
assets with a net book value of £186 million as described in note 15. Following the acquisition in 2017, the 
appropriate discount rate was assessed as being higher for Opus Energy than for Haven Power. The expected 
future cash flows were discounted using a range of discount rates from the Group’s central B2B Energy Supply 
assumption (8.1%) to the rate used in the valuation of Opus Energy at the acquisition date (10.7% - see note 
13). The application of discount rates across this range does not result in a recoverable amount for Opus 
Energy below its carrying amount. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU. This 
analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins 
and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill. 
15 INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible 
assets can be acquired in business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or 
purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, 
which are considered intangible assets. 
Accounting policy 
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other 
intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and 
any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by 
management. 
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date. No changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2017. Amortisation calculations are 
specific to each category of assets and are explained in further detail below. 
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related 
assets and brand are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this 
CGU are included in note 14. 
Significant estimation uncertainty 
The valuation of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Opus Energy is dependent upon a 
number of assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are explained under each of the asset 
headings below.

Customer related assets 
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in 
February 2017, which provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. 
The asset valuation of £211 million reflects the estimated acquisition-date value of the future cash flows 
associated with this customer base and is dependent upon estimates of both current and expected future 
contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has a useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate 
analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract 
renewals over time. 
Opus Brand 
The Opus brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017, and valued at £11 million on a relief-
from-royalty method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed ten-year useful 
life. 
Computer software 
In light of continued investment and the increased significance of the carrying amount, the Group’s software 
assets are presented separately within intangible assets (2016: included within tangible fixed assets). Additions 
in the period include assets acquired in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course 
of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the B2B Energy 
Supply segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging 
between three and five years. 
Computer software assets in the course of construction of £11.1 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £nil 
million) were capitalised in the year. 
 
Development assets 
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 
and reflect the value of planning and consents acquired as part of that transaction. Until operations commence, 
the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and will be subject to 
impairment testing at each balance sheet date. 
At 31 December 2017 the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value in use 
calculation derived from the Group’s established planning model, consistent with the approach described in 
note 4. The assessment incorporated assumptions related to likely capacity market clearing prices, 
construction costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the direct costs 
of generating those revenues. The analysis indicated a recoverable amount for the development assets in 
excess of their carrying amount. 
Carbon assets 
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under 
the Emissions Trading Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of 
any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not amortised. 
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to 
satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to 
the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, the market price at the balance 
sheet date. 
Post balance sheet events 
The 2021 T-4 capacity market auction closed in February 2018 at a clearing price of £8.40/kW. The Group 
secured agreements to provide a total of 1,217MW of capacity from two existing coal units, worth a total of £10 
million for the period October 2021 to September 2022. 
Two of the Group’s Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects also participated in the auction but exited above 
the clearing price. The Group will continue to develop these options with an expectation that they will go on to 
participate in the next T-4 auction. This outcome does not change the Group’s view of the recoverable amount 
of the existing investments in the OCGT projects or the fair value of the contingent consideration that may 
become payable following future capacity market outcomes.
