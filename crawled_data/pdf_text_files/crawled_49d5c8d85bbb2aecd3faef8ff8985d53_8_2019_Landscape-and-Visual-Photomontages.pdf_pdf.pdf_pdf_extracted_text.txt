Visually Verified Montages and 
Methodology 
A.1 
Visually Verified Montages Methodology 
2.1.1 
This section has been prepared by AECOM to explain the 
methodology used for the production of the Visually Verified 
Montages (VVMs) for the Project. 
2.1.2 
The purpose of a VVM is to present an accurate visualisation of 
the Project, enabling its impact on the skyline, surrounding area 
and setting to be objectively evaluated. This methodology complies 
with the current photography and photomontage advice note, 
which can be found here:

phyAdviceNote01-11.pdf
2.1.3 
Photographs and VVMs often form an important part of planning 
applications and Environmental Statements, in which the 
preparation and presentation of reliable visual information is 
integral to the assessment of landscape and visual effects. 
Photographs and VVMs are technical documents in this context, 
and should be produced and used in a technically appropriate 
manner. 
a) Objectives
2.1.4 
The overall aim of a VVM is to represent both the landscape 
context under consideration and the proposed development, as 
accurately as is practical. 
2.1.5 
The objective of a VVM is to simulate the likely visual changes that 
would result from a proposed development, and to produce printed 
images of a size and resolution sufficient to match the perspective 
in the same view in the field. 
2.1.6 
VVMs use photographs of an actual scene modified by the 
insertion of an accurate representation of the visible changes 
brought about by the Proposed Development. They are subject to 
the same inherent limitations as photographs, for example only 
showing the scene as it would appear under the same conditions 
that prevailed when the original photograph was captured. A 
properly constructed VVM can serve as a useful tool to illustrate 
the likely visual change that would result from a proposed 
development 
b) Photography
i.
Digital Photography
2.1.7 
Changes in all aspects of photography and VVMs have taken 
place over the last ten years. 35mm colour film and the associated 
cameras and lenses have been almost completely supplanted by 
digital cameras; digital image processing is now a fundamental 
element of photography, both within the firmware of the camera 
and as a subsequent operation on a computer. Printing has 
similarly become wholly digital, using a wide variety of devices 
offering different qualities of output. Future changes will 
undoubtedly further change the parameters for landscape 
photography. A good quality camera and lens are essential to the 
production of photographs and VVMs for landscape and visual 
impact assessment work. 
ii.
Digital Camera & Lenses
2.1.8 
High resolution digital photography was captured with a Canon 
EOS 5D Mk III, a full-frame digital camera using a variety of fixed 
focal-length lenses to accommodate the necessary scope of the 
Development and relevant context. The camera was fixed to a 
tripod 1.5m above ground. 
iii.
Data capture
2.1.9 
The photographer was provided with location information indicating 
the position of each viewpoint from which the required 
photographs were to be taken, plus a digital photograph of the 
desired view. For each photograph, the camera was positioned at 
a height of 1.5m above the ground level to approximate the human 
eye level. OS Location of the camera position was captured, as 
well as the focal length, date, time, weather and lighting conditions 
of the photograph. A variety of control points within the view were 
also accurately surveyed, in order to allow the 3D data to be 
camera matched or keyed into each photograph. 
c) Image Processing
iv.
File conversion
2.1.10 
The camera outputs a ‘raw’ file format, which was processed 
digitally to ensure colour accuracy. The final image was then 
outputted as a standard compressed file-type (JPG). 
v.
Image correction
2.1.11 
The compressed photographs were processed and stitched using 
the package Hugin, which provides a suite of advanced features 
and libraries for re-projecting and blending multiple source images 
into panoramics with exposure, vignetting and white balance 
correction. Despite the advances in digital photography over the 
last 10 years, the circular nature of lenses results in a small 
amount of distortion on the perimeter of images. Due to this, the 
very outer edges of an image are often not taken into 
consideration to minimise the risk of inaccuracy. 
d) 3D model
vi.
3D model creation
2.1.12 
A three-dimensional computer model of the development and the 
various assessment features was supplied by the Engineers, in 
house GIS teams and other designers. 
vii.
Scale, height & position check
2.1.13 
Once received, the model was positioned using Architectural 
general arrangement drawings, OS site plans and surveyed level 
information. The surveyed control points were then brought into the 
model, in an easily visible contrasting colour. Virtual cameras of 
matching specifications to the recorded camera and lens used for 
each view were then placed within the scene at the correct 
surveyed location. The virtual 3D camera was then rotated to the 
correct position using the captured photography as a backplate. 
e) Rendering
viii. Sunlight & daylight
2.1.14 
The VRaySun and VRaySky are special features within our 
rendering software which are provided as part of the Chaosgroup 
Vray renderer, utilised by AECOM. Developed to work together, the 
VRaySun and VRaySky reproduce the real-life Sun and Sky 
environment of the Earth. Both are programed so that they change 
their appearance depending on a number of factors, such as the 
direction of the VRaySun; which was dynamically linked and geo-
referenced to the real world position of the site, the time, day and 
month. Different sky options were also chosen (clear, overcast, 
etc.) to match the digital photography. 
2.1.15 
Using this lighting system, alongside the physically accurate 
material properties, the software calculated the effects of the sun 
and sky conditions on the appearance of the proposed scheme, 
maximising fidelity of the illustrated structures. 
f)
Post production
ix.
Post production
2.1.16 
Once the rendering stage was complete, the images were brought 
into Adobe Photoshop to superimpose the proposed development 
onto the digital images of the site. The foreground details such as 
trees, buildings or signage were then overlaid as masks; ensuring 
the depth of the various items was represented correctly. If 
required, the rendered image was then further edited to accurately 
match the colour, saturation and environmental effects shown in 
the photograph. This is a qualitative or subjective process, but 
effort is made to ensure it provides objectively accurate views of 
the Development as proposed. 
g) Review
x.
Review
2.1.17 
A final qualitative check of all of the AVRs was carried out with 
other members of the project team to ensure that they provided 
objectively accurate views of the Project from the information 
provided.
