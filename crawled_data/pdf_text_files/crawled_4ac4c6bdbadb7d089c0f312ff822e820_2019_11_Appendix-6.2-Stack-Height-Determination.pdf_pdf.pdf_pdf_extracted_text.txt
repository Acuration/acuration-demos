Stack Height Determination
Appendix 6.2 Stack Height Determination 
6.1.1 
Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using Cwm Level Park 
meteorological data from 2012 to 2016 with the maximum ground-level 
concentrations predicted across a grid of receptors with a model resolution 
of 30 m.  
6.1.2 
Dispersion model runs were undertaken for various stack heights between 
20 m and 50 m with the stack height models in 2 metre incremental heights 
within this range. Table  and the associated Figure A6-1 to Figure A6.3 show 
the results of the stack height sensitivity testing. The appropriate stack height 
was determined as the point at which the change in maximum predicted 
annual and 99.79th percentile NO2 concentrations with each stack increase 
ceased to be significant.  When plotted as a graph this is the point at which 
the curve flattens of after an initial rapid decrease with each increase in 
stack height.

Note: Annual mean NO2 AQS objective 40 µg/m3, daily 99.79th percentile NO2 AQS 
objective 200 µg/m3, CO 8 hour running 10,000 µg/m3. 
6.1.3 
Significant benefits are seen as the stack height increases from 20 m to 32 
m, in terms of maximum ground level concentrations of NO2 (both annual 
and 99.79th percentile hourly concentrations) and CO, as the impacts of 
building downwash reduce. Beyond this height, there is only a slight benefit 
seen, in terms of maximum ground level concentrations, with increasing 
stack height further, though there is a further decrease between 32 and 34 m 
when looking at 99.79th percentile hourly NO2 concentrations though this 
also flattens out after 34 m. The continuing small decrease in maximum 
concentrations above 32/34 m is driven by the fact that with each stack 
increase the plume disperses slightly more before reaching ground-level, 
however, as thee changes above 34 m are so small this indicates that the 
dispersion is no longer influenced by building downwash. When the stack 
height is increased to 34 m, the maximum impact on ground level 
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide is less than 1% of the annual mean 
objective and both NO2 and CO are well below 10% of their relevant short-
term AQS objectives.   
6.1.4 
A minimum stack height of 35 m has been proposed by APL for the Power 
Generation Plant and a maximum height of 45 m.  The assessment of 
impacts at both human health and ecological receptors has, therefore, used 
a stack height of 35 m as this represents the worst-case in terms of 
dispersion.  For other disciplines the maximum stack height of 45 m has 
been assumed as this represents a worst-case e.g. in terms of landscape 
and visual impacts etc.
