This publication contains the main fndings of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 
2020 (FRA 2020). The data in FRA 2020 – the “backbone” of the assessment –  
have been obtained through a transparent, traceable reporting process and  
 
The application of a standardized reporting methodology enables the monitoring of 
change over time in parameters such as forest area, management, ownership  
and use and the aggregation of data at the regional and global levels. 
The information provided by FRA presents a comprehensive view of the world’s 
forests and the ways in which the resource is changing. Such a clear global picture 
forests and forestry. 
FRA is the mechanism for collecting data on two forest-related indicators of the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the United Nations General Assembly 
adopted in 2015. Specifcally, data submitted to FRA contribute to reporting on SDG 
indicator 15.1.1 (forest area as a proportion of total land area in 2015) and indicator 
15.2.1 (progress towards sustainable forest management).

1     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
Forests cover nearly
one-third of the land globally
 
The world has a total forest area of 4.06 billion hectares (ha), which is 31 percent 
of the total land area. This area is equivalent to 0.52 ha per person1  – although 
forests are not distributed equally among the world’s peoples or geographically. 
The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the world’s forests (45 percent), 
followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.
More than half (54 percent) of the world’s forests is in only five countries – 
the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America 
and China.

2     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
The world’s forest area is decreasing,
but the rate of loss has slowed 
 
The world has lost 178 million ha of forest since 1990, which is an area about  
the size of Libya. 
The rate of net forest loss decreased substantially over the period 1990–2020  
due to a reduction in deforestation in some countries, plus increases in forest 
area in others through afforestation and the natural expansion of forests. 
The rate of net forest loss declined from 7.8 million ha per year in the  
decade 1990–2000 to 5.2 million ha per year in 2000–2010 and 4.7 million ha
per year in 2010–2020. The rate of decline of net forest loss slowed in the most 
recent decade due to a reduction in the rate of forest expansion.
FAO defines deforestation as the conversion 
of forest to other land uses (regardless 
of whether it is human-induced). 
“Deforestation” and “forest area net change” 
are not the same: the latter is the sum of  
all forest losses (deforestation) and all forest 
gains (forest expansion) in a given period. 
Net change, therefore, can be positive  
or negative, depending on whether gains 
exceed losses, or vice versa.

3     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
Africa has the highest net loss of forest area
 
Africa had the largest annual rate of net forest loss in 2010–2020,  
at 3.9 million ha, followed by South America, at 2.6 million ha. 
The rate of net forest loss has increased in Africa in each of the three decades 
since 1990. It has declined substantially in South America, however, to about half 
the rate in  2010–2020 compared with 2000–2010.
Asia had the highest net gain of forest area in 2010–2020, followed by Oceania 
and Europe.2 Nevertheless, both Europe and Asia recorded substantially lower 
rates of net gain in 2010–2020 than in 2000–2010. Oceania experienced net losses 
of forest area in the decades 1990–2000 and 2000–2010.

4     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
Deforestation continues, but at a lower rate
 
An estimated 420 million ha of forest has been lost worldwide through 
deforestation since 1990, but the rate of forest loss has declined substantially.  
In the most recent five-year period (2015–2020), the annual rate of deforestation 
was estimated at 10 million ha, down from 12 million ha in 2010–2015.

More than 90 percent of the world’s forests
have regenerated naturally  
Ninety-three percent (3.75 billion ha) of the forest area worldwide is composed of 
naturally regenerating forests and 7 percent (290 million ha) is planted. 
The area of naturally regenerating forests has decreased since 1990  
(at a declining rate of loss), but the area of planted forests has increased by  
123 million ha. The rate of increase in the area of planted forest has slowed in 
the last ten years.
 
5     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
Plantations account for
about 3 percent of the world’s forests
 
Plantation forests cover about 131 million ha, which is 3 percent of the global 
forest area and 45 percent of the total area of planted forests.  
Plantation forests are intensively managed, composed of one or two 
species, even-aged, planted with regular spacing, and established mainly 
for productive purposes. Other planted forests, which comprise 55 percent 
of all planted forests, are not intensively managed, and they may resemble 
natural forests at stand maturity. The purposes of other planted forests may 
include ecosystem restoration and the protection of soil and water values.

6     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
The highest share of plantation forest is in South America, where this forest 
type represents 99 percent of the total planted-forest area and 2 percent of the  
total forest area. 
The lowest share of plantation forest is in Europe, where it represents 6 percent 
of the planted forest estate and 0.4 percent of the total forest area. 
Globally, 44 percent of plantation forests are composed mainly of introduced 
species. There are large differences between regions: for example, plantation 
forests in North and Central America mostly comprise native species and those in 
South America consist almost entirely of introduced species.

7     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
More than 700 million ha of forest is 
in legally established protected areas
 
There is an estimated 726 million ha of forest in protected areas worldwide.  
Of the six major world regions, South America has the highest share of forests in 
protected areas, at 31 percent.
The area of forest in protected areas globally has increased by 191 million ha 
since 1990, but the rate of annual increase slowed in 2010–2020.  
Primary forests cover about 1 billion ha
The world still has at least 1.11 billion ha of primary forest – that is, forests 
composed of native species in which there are no clearly visible indications 
of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly 
disturbed. Combined, three countries – Brazil, Canada and the Russian 
Federation – host more than half (61 percent) of the world’s primary forest. 
The area of primary forest has decreased by 81 million ha since 1990, but the 
rate of loss more than halved in 2010–2020 compared with the previous decade.

More than 2 billion ha of forest has management plans
Most of the forests in Europe have management plans; on the other hand, 
management plans exist for less than 25 percent of forests in Africa and less 
than 20 percent in South America. The area of forest under management plans is 
increasing in all regions – globally, it has increased by 233 million ha since 2000, 
reaching 2.05 billion ha in 2020.

Fire is a prevalent forest disturbance in the tropics 
 
Forests face many disturbances that can adversely affect their health and vitality 
and reduce their ability to provide a full range of goods and ecosystem services. 
About 98 million ha of forest were affected by fire in 2015;3 this was mainly in 
the tropical domain, where fire burned about 4 percent of the total forest area in 
that year. More than two-thirds of the total forest area affected was in Africa  
and South America. 
Insects, diseases and severe weather events damaged about 40 million ha of 
forests in 2015, mainly in the temperate and boreal domains.
9     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
4 As of 2015, the latest year for which global data are available.
The world’s forests are mostly publicly owned, 
but the share of privately owned forests 
has increased since 1990 
 
Seventy-three percent of the world’s forests is under public ownership,4 
22 percent is privately owned, and the ownership of the remainder is categorized 
as either “unknown” or “other” (the latter mainly comprising forests where 
ownership is disputed or in transition). 
Public ownership is predominant in all regions and most subregions.  
Of the regions, Oceania, North and Central America and South America have 
the highest proportions of private forests.
Globally, the share of publicly owned forests has decreased since 1990 and the 
area of forest under private ownership has increased.

10     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
Public administrations hold management rights to 83 percent of the publicly 
owned forest area globally. Management by public administrations is particularly 
predominant in South America, where it accounts for 97 percent of management 
responsibility in publicly owned forests. The share of public administration 
management rights has decreased globally since 1990, with an increasing 
share of publicly owned forests managed by private businesses, entities and 
institutions and by indigenous and tribal communities. 
 
The world’s forest growing stock 
is declining 
 
The world’s total growing stock of trees decreased slightly, from 560 billion m3  
in 1990 to 557 billion m3 in 2020, due to a net decrease in forest area. On the 
other hand, growing stock is increasing per unit area globally and in all regions;  
it rose from 132 m3 per ha in 1990 to 137 m3 per ha in 2020. Growing stock  
per unit area is highest in the tropical forests of South and Central America and 
West and Central Africa. 
The world’s forests contain about 606 gigatonnes of living biomass  
(above- and below-ground) and 59 gigatonnes of dead wood. The total biomass 
has decreased slightly since 1990 but biomass per unit area has increased.

Total forest carbon stock
is decreasing 
 
Most forest carbon is found in the living biomass (44 percent) and soil organic 
matter (45 percent), with the remainder in dead wood and litter. The total carbon 
stock in forests decreased from 668 gigatonnes in 1990 to 662 gigatonnes  
in 2020;  carbon density increased slightly over the same period, from 159 tonnes 
to 163 tonnes per ha.
About 30 percent of all forests 
is used primarily for production
 
Globally, about 1.15 billion ha of forest is managed primarily for the production 
of wood and non-wood forest products. In addition, 749 million ha is designated 
for multiple use, which often includes production. 
Worldwide, the area of forest designated primarily for production has been 
relatively stable since 1990 but the area of multiple-use forest has decreased by 
about 71 million ha.  
12     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings
About ten percent of the world’s forests
is allocated for biodiversity conservation 
 
Globally, 424 million ha of forest is designated primarily for biodiversity 
conservation. In total, 111 million ha has been so designated since 1990, 
of which the largest part was allocated between 2000 and 2010. The rate of 
increase in the area of forest designated primarily for biodiversity conservation 
has slowed in the last ten years.  
The area of forest designated primarily for
soil and water protection is increasing
 
An estimated 399 million ha of forest is designated primarily for the protection 
of soil and water, an increase of 119 million ha since 1990. The rate of increase in 
the area of forest allocated for this purpose has grown over the entire period but 
especially in the last ten years. 
More than 180 million ha of forest
is used mainly for social services
 
An area of 186 million ha of forest worldwide is allocated for social services 
such as recreation, tourism, education research and the conservation of cultural 
and spiritual sites. The area designated for this forest use has increased at a rate 
of 186 000 ha per year since 2010. 
Note that numbers may not sum to the totals indicated and percentages may not tally to 100 due to rounding. 
Not all countries reported on all parameters mentioned here.
The full report of FRA 2020, including an in-depth analysis 
and individual reports from the 236 countries and territories 
covered by the assessment, will be published in June 2020. 
The complete FRA 2020 database and the 236 individual 
reports will be available online from mid-2020.

Since 1946, FAO has been monitoring 
the world’s forest resources through 
periodic assessments conducted  
in cooperation with its member countries. 
The Global Forest Resources Assessment 
2020 (FRA 2020), the latest of these 
assessments, examines the status of, 
and trends in, more than 60 forest-related 
variables in 236 countries and territories 
in the period 1990–2020.
This publication, which contains 
the key findings of FRA 2020, presents 
a comprehensive view of the world’s 
forests and the ways in which the resource 
is changing. Such a clear global picture 
supports the development of sound 
policies, practices and investments 
affecting forests and forestry.
