INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
PROJECT BACKGROUND  
1.1.1. 
The Hirwaun Power Project (henceforth referred to as the HPP or the Project) involves the construction and 
operation of a single gas turbine generator of circa 299 Megawatts electrical (MWe) output and associated gas 
pipeline on land at Hirwaun Industrial Estate, South Wales.   
1.1.2. 
The Project obtained a Development Consent Order (DCO) in 2015 (2015 No. 1574), giving legal consent for 
the Project to go ahead subject to a number of Requirements being discharged. This DCO was later amended 
by the Hirwaun Generating Station (Amendment) Order 2016 and the Hirwaun Generating Station 
(Amendment) Order 2017 to provide for non-material changes to the DCO as made – hereafter referred to as 
‘the DCO’. The DCO provides for the power generation plant component of the Project, to which this document 
relates. 
1.1.3. 
The gas pipeline component of the Project was subject to full planning permission which was granted by 
Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC) in October 2015 (ref: 15/1213/10). This document 
does not relate to the gas pipeline component of the Project, as this will be dealt with under a separate 
application.  
1.1.4. 
Figure 1 shows the location of the Site within which the power generation plant component of the Project will 
be located and to which the DCO and this document relates. This area will henceforth be referred to as the 
Site.  
Figure 1 – Site Location Plan (power generation plant) 
 
1.1.5. 
The Project has been the subject of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and, therefore, has been 
assessed for significant environmental effects from construction, operation and decommissioning activities 
through an Environmental Statement (ES). This informed the commitments required as part of the DCO and

the planning permission (ref: 15/1213/10) including the requirement to submit and have approved a 
Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP).  
1.1.6. 
The CTMP is being prepared in two stages to address demolition and construction aspects of the project 
separately.  This Stage 1 CTMP considers the demolition stage only (Numbered Work 1 of Schedule 1 of the 
DCO) and relates only to the power generation plant component of the Project (i.e. that part of the Project 
authorised by the DCO).  A separate Stage 2 CTMP will be prepared to consider the construction stage of the 
Project, which will cover both construction of the power generation plant and the gas pipeline.   
1.2 
PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT 
1.2.1. 
The purpose of this Stage 1 CTMP is to address the demolition requirements attached to the DCO in respect 
of the power generation plant component of the Project, specifically in relation to Schedule 1 Numbered Work 
1 and: 
Schedule 2 Requirement 13 of the DCO 
13.—(1) No numbered work of the authorised development other than tree felling and the bat 
mitigation structure forming part of numbered work 2E(g) of the authorised development is to 
commence until a construction traffic management plan covering that numbered work has 
been submitted to and approved by the relevant planning authority in consultation with Welsh 
Government Transport. The construction traffic management plan is to detail the proposals for 
the movement of construction traffic and abnormal indivisible loads associated with the 
authorised development and is to include- 
(a) construction vehicle routing plans at 1:2,500 scale for all traffic including abnormal 
indivisible loads showing 
(i) swept path analysis from the point of entry onto the highway network to the 
Order land; 
(ii)highway mitigation in respect of any identified constraints on vehicle 
movements such as embargo periods, route traffic sensitivity, temporary road 
works and other highway restrictions to be developed following consultation 
with the South Wales Trunk Road Agent, and, where relevant, referring to 
supporting HD19/03 safety audit documentation (as contained within the Design 
Manual for Roads and Bridges Volume 5 Section 2 Part 2 and as amended or 
replaced); and 
(iii)land ownership boundaries for any required holding areas, passing areas and 
layover areas; 
(b)evidence of appropriate trial runs that demonstrate the suitability of the route from point of 
entry onto the trunk road network to the Order land for the proposed types of abnormal 
indivisible loads; 
(c)site access plans at 1:2,500 scale that include supporting HD19/03 safety audit 
documentation (as contained within the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges Volume 
5 Section 2 Part 2 and as amended or replaced); 
(d)proposals for the management of junctions to and crossings of the public highway during 
delivery of abnormal indivisible loads; 
(e)proposals for the scheduling and timing of movements of delivery vehicles, to be developed 
following consultation with the Welsh Government and potentially affected undertakers, and, 
in relation to any abnormal indivisible loads, details of vehicle parameters, number of vehicles 
in convoy size, dimensions (width, length, height) and weight (total vehicle with load and axel 
loading);  
(f)details of escorts for abnormal indivisible loads highlighting where and when along the route 
private vehicles, banksman and Police vehicles escorts will be used (including emergency 
contingencies); 
(g)proposals for temporary warning signs and banksman for abnormal indivisible loads, 
including provision of plan drawings and associated traffic signs schedule highlighting

locations along the route where temporary traffic management (including cones and 
temporary signs) needs to be deployed; 
(h)a methodology for undertaking a conditions survey of Main Avenue, Fourth Avenue 
and any other land identified during the trial runs that may have a constraining impact 
on the abnormal indivisible load movements including the timescales for undertaking 
the surveys and the method(s) of reporting the findings to the relevant planning 
authority, comprehensive photographs and potential compensation arrangements; 
(i)details of any temporary or permanent improvements to highways; 
(j)proposals for the making good of any incidental damage to highways by construction 
traffic associated with the authorised development including street furniture, 
structures, drainage features, highway verge and carriageway surfaces; 
(k)proposals for traffic management controls (such as temporary signals), diversion routes and 
signage required during any of the activities, operations or works set out in Schedule 4; and  
(l)proposals for the notification of occupiers of land adjacent to the construction traffic route of 
the scheduling and timing of abnormal indivisible load movements from the point of exit from 
the trunk road network to the Order land.  
 
(2) The construction traffic management plan must be implemented as approved. 
(3) During the operation or decommissioning of numbered work 2 no abnormal indivisible loads must 
be transported into or out of the Order land without the prior written approval of the relevant planning 
authority in consultation with Welsh Government Transport. 
1.2.2. 
This Stage 1 CTMP supports an application for the partial discharge of DCO Requirement 13 and specifically, 
includes those items set out in bold above. This is because only the items bolded are of relevance to the 
demolition phase. Items 13(1)(b), (d), (f), (g) and (l) are not relevant to the Stage 1 CTMP for demolition as no 
abnormal indivisible vehicles are required as part of the demolition stage. Item 13(1)(a)(iii) is not relevant to 
this CTMP as no holding areas or passing areas will be required within the highway network for the demolition 
phase and there is space within the proposed laydown area to hold HGVs within the Site itself if necessary. 
Item 13(1)(e) relates to scheduling and timing for delivery vehicles, which also is not relevant to the demolition 
stage and is, therefore, not dealt with in this Stage 1 CTMP. Item 13(1)(k) is not relevant to this Stage 1 CTMP 
as none of the works set out in Schedule 4 of the DCO will be undertaken during the demolition stage.  
1.2.3. 
All of those items in regular text (i.e. not bolded) that are of relevance to the construction stage will be included 
in the Stage 2 CTMP dealing with the construction stage. The requirements of planning condition 14 (ref: 
15/1213/10), which relate to the gas connection, will also be dealt with under the Stage 2 CTMP.   
1.3 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1.3.1. 
The HPP will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and has been designed to provide 
an electrical output of up to 299 MWe. The plant will be fuelled by natural gas. The three main elements of the 
HPP comprise: 
� A new Power Generation Plant - a SCGT gas fired ‘peaking’ power generating plant, capable of providing 
up to 299 MWe; 
� A new underground electrical cable connection (the Electrical Connection) to export electricity from the 
Power Generation Plant into the National Grid at Rhigos Substation; and 
� A new underground gas pipeline connection (the Gas Connection) to bring natural gas to the Power 
Generation Plant from the existing high pressure gas network National Transmission System in the vicinity 
of the Project site. This element of the Project also includes the above ground installation (AGI) for the gas 
pipeline at the point of connection to the National Transmission System (NTS), as well as a new permanent 
access to the AGI. 
1.3.2. 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection together are referred to as the HPP 
and are all integral to the generation of electricity and the subsequent export of that electricity to the National 
Grid.

EXISTING HIGHWAY CONDITIONS 
2.1 
LOCAL HIGHWAY NETWORK 
2.1.1. 
The A465 runs north-west to south-east to the north of the Site and is a dual carriageway between the Rhigos 
Roundabout and Glyneath to the west.  To the east of the Rhigos Roundabout, the A465 is a single three lane 
carriageway with two lanes in the uphill direction and one in the downhill direction.  The section of the A465 to 
the east has been identified for upgrade to two lanes in each direction. 
2.1.2. 
Rhigos Road is a single carriageway local B road running east to west along the southern edge of the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate, and is marked with national speed limit.  It connects the A465 to Cefn Rhigos and Pont 
Walby. 
2.1.3. 
The A4061 is a local road that runs north to meet Rhigos Road at a roundabout junction in the south east 
corner of Hirwaun Industrial Estate, and then turns east to join the A465.  The road connects Trehebert in the 
south to Hirwaun town and the Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  The A4061 operates under the national speed limit. 
2.1.4. 
Fourth Avenue is a local road that forms a simple T-junction with Main Avenue at the south east corner of the 
Site.  The road has a 30mph speed limit for the majority of its length.   
2.1.5. 
Fifth Avenue forms an arc running north-south from Rhigos Road towards the underpass of the A465 where it 
then runs parallel with the A465 before it joins with Halt Road at the west of Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  The 
road has a 30mph speed limit for the majority of its length.  Fifth Avenue has a roundabout junction with Main 
Avenue. 
2.1.6. 
Main Avenue is also a local road within Hirwaun Industrial Estate that runs east west through the centre of 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  The speed limit is 30mph.  At the opposite end to its junction with Fifth Avenue, 
Main Avenue meets Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth Avenue, all of which are similar standard.

SITE ACCESS, PARKING, AND LAYDOWN AREAS 
3.1 
SITE ACCESS  
3.1.1. 
The laydown area for demolition activities will be provided in the north-east corner of the Site and will be 
accessed from an existing gated access on Fourth Avenue. This will be the primary access to the Site for the 
demolition phase. 
3.1.2. 
The Site compound incorporating site office and welfare facilities is expected to be provided in the south west 
corner of the Site and be accessed from an existing gated access on Main Avenue. This will be the secondary 
access to the Project Site. Pedestrian access will also be from Main Avenue. In the case that the site office 
and welfare facilities are provided alongside the laydown area in the north-east corner of the Site, they would 
also be accessed from the gated access on Fourth Avenue. The CTMP provides for both scenarios.  
3.1.3. 
The swept path drawings at Appendix B show the point of entry onto the highway network from the Site (the 
Order land, as required by Requirement 13(1)(a)(i)), at both the primary access on Fourth Avenue and 
secondary access on Main Avenue. 
3.1.4. 
Vehicular swept path analysis for the low loader vehicle, which may be used to transport plant to site, for 
egress from the site access on Main Avenue is likely to cause kerb overrun. This is caused due to the 
positioning of the existing gatehouse. Alternative egress points including the access lane immediately west of 
the existing gatehouse and the north east corner of site onto Fourth Avenue may be used. It should be noted 
that any damage of defect caused to existing highway infrastructure is to be made good upon completion of 
the works.  
3.2 
VEHICLE ROUTING 
3.2.1. 
The principal route for demolition traffic accessing the Site will be between the A465 and the primary site 
access at Fourth Avenue.  Demolition traffic (HGVs) will access the Site from the A465 using the A465/Rhigos 
Roundabout and then via the A4061 Rhigos Road, Fifth Avenue, and Main Avenue. 
3.2.2. 
The secondary route for accessing the Site will be from the A4061 Rhigos Road to the south.  Demolition 
traffic (HGVs) will access the Site from the A4061 using the A4061 Rhigos Road Roundabout and then via 
Fifth Avenue and Main Avenue. 
3.2.3. 
A Construction Vehicle Routing plan and Site Access Plan at 1:2,500 scale for all construction traffic is 
included at Appendix C and D respectively (as required by Requirement 13(a) and (c)). It should be noted 
access to the Site by abnormal indivisible modes is not required during the demolition stage and is therefore 
not considered in this Stage 1 CTMP. 
3.3 
STAFF PARKING 
3.3.1. 
Staff parking will be provided within the site compound adjacent to the site office or in the laydown area as 
shown in Appendix A according to the demolition contractor’s requirements. All staff parking during the 
demolition phase will be contained within the Site. At this stage it is expected that additional staff parking will 
be provided to the south of Main Avenue during the construction stage of the project, however this will be 
confirmed in the Stage 2 CTMP. 
3.4 
LAYDOWN AREAS 
3.4.1. 
As noted above, the laydown area for demolition activities will be provided in the north-east corner of the Site 
and will be accessed from an existing gated access on Fourth Avenue. The laydown area is expected to be 
used for: 
� Plant Storage; 
� Skip Locations; 
� Waste Processing; 
� Waste Storage; 
� Material Storage; and 
� Wheel Washing Facilities.

SIGNAGE  
3.5.1. 
Appropriate signage to ensure sufficient guidance for construction traffic will be provided, and to ensure that 
the traffic accesses the Site efficiently using the Rhigos Road to access the A465 at the Rhigos Roundabout to 
the east. More specifically, this will guide demolition traffic in and out of the laydown area described above. 
Signage will also be used as a means of guiding the workers to the designated parking areas. Any signage 
required for the demolition phase will be developed in consultation with RCTCBC.

DEMOLITION PROGRAMME AND TRIP GENERATION 
4.1 
DEMOLITION PROGRAMME 
4.1.1. 
The demolition stage of the Project is anticipated to commence in mid-August 2018, subject to the necessary 
Requirements being discharged, and is programmed for a duration of approximately three months excluding 
pre-start works. 
4.1.2. 
The demolition stage of works will involve the demolition of existing buildings and structures (with the 
exception of the new bat mitigation structure authorised under Requirement 4(7), including foundations, 
hardstanding and service areas.  Demolition activities will only be undertaken within the main power 
generation plant component of the overall Project Site (refer Figure 1), either side of Main Avenue (i.e. no 
demolition activities are required in relation to the gas pipeline component.) Table 1 contains a summary of the 
anticipated demolition programme and associated staffing levels on-site.

4.2 
DEMOLITION WORKING HOURS 
4.2.1. 
In accordance with Requirement 14 of the DCO, no construction work, or the delivery or removal of materials 
is to take place outside the hours of – (a) 0700 and 1830 hours on weekdays (excl. public holidays); and (b) 
0700 and 1300 hours on Saturdays and public holidays.  Working hours outside of these periods would be 
agreed in advance with RCTCBC but are not anticipated at this stage. 
4.3 
TRIP GENERATION - DEMOLITION WORKERS 
4.3.1. 
‘Insert 13.13 Schedule of Construction Workers’ contained in the ES indicated a peak of 91 construction workers 
on site during the construction stage, which included the demolition phase.  During the demolition phase of the 
project, up to 12 staff will be required onsite for the pre-start works (weeks 1-4) and then up to 36 staff during 
each of the subsequent weeks (weeks 5 – 16). 
4.3.2. 
The impacts of construction worker traffic on the transport network for the peak periods of construction related 
activities have been assessed in the ES and it was considered that even at a peak of 91 construction workers 
on site, there would be no significant impacts. 
4.4 
HGV TRIP GENERATION - DEMOLITION TRAFFIC 
4.4.1. 
A profile showing the number of HGVs trips (arrival and departure) over the duration of the demolition phase 
has been included in Figure 2 below. The daily profile is based on the demolition programme and associated 
activities provided by the contractor. 
4.4.2. 
Throughout the day, it is assumed that HGVs will have a linear profile of arrival and departure during the working 
day between 07.00 and 18:30. The anticipated average peak number of HGVs per day is up to 64 (or 128 trips)

during week 13, which equates to 12 HGV trips per hour on average.  The anticipated average number of HGVs 
throughout the demolition works is 52 trips per day, which equates to five HGV trips per hour. 
 
Figure 2 - Demolition Traffic - HGV Trip Generation (2-way) 
 
4.4.3. 
Table 13.18 in the ES indicated 70 HGVs per day during quarter one (demolition), which equated to 149 trips 
per day or 13 trips per hour, which is more than the current estimates for demolition. The impacts of HGV traffic 
on the transport network for the peak periods of construction related activities have been assessed in the ES 
and it was considered that there would be no significant impacts of using the access routes described in Section 
3.2. As the number of HGVs is slightly less than presented in the ES, the impacts of demolition using the more 
up to date trip generation estimates therefore remain valid. 
4.5 
DEMOLITION VEHICLES 
4.5.1. 
Vehicles associated with the demolition stage will include but not be limited to mixer trucks, tipper trucks, 
cranes, articulated wagons, curtain sided wagons, and delivery vans. 
4.5.2. 
The project will not require the delivery of AILs during the demolition stage. Further consultation will be 
undertaken with RCTCBC and SWTRA as part of the preparation of the Stage 2 CTMP for the construction 
stage. 
4.6 
ROAD CLOSURES 
4.6.1. 
As part of the demolition activities a road closure will be required to allow the demolition of a bridge between 
Building 1 and Building 2 as shown on the DCO Approved Works Plans at Appendix E. It is anticipated that Main 
Avenue will need to be closed between its junction with Fourth Avenue and the access to the site compound to 
the west for up to two days. 
4.6.2. 
It is anticipated that the bridge demolition works will take place during weeks 3-5.  The appointed contractor will 
liaise with RCTCBC and local businesses to ensure disruption is kept to a minimum and, with this in mind, bridge 
demolition will take place over a weekend if practicable. There are alternative routes available between Rhigos

Road and the businesses to the east and west of the project Site.  Appropriate diversion and road closure 
signage will be developed in consultation with RCTCBC. 
4.7 
HIGHWAY CONDITION SURVEY OF MAIN AVENUE AND FOURTH 
AVENUE 
4.7.1. 
A condition survey of highways immediately surrounding the Site will be carried out prior to demolition 
commencing. This will include Main Avenue and Fourth Avenue, with the extent to be agreed with the local 
highway authority. The survey will be a visual inspection, with the purpose being to gather photographic evidence 
of the condition of these sections of highway prior to demolition commencing and, therefore inform the need for 
maintenance/repair at the conclusion of works.  
4.7.2. 
A letter summarising the findings of the survey, along with the photographs obtained, will be provided to 
RCTCBC for information within two months of the survey being undertaken. Any road maintenance issues or 
damage deemed to be attributable to the demolition phase will be rectified, and the road will be returned to its 
former condition making good of any incidental damage to highways by construction traffic associated with the 
authorised development including street furniture, structures, drainage features, highway verge and carriageway 
surfaces.  Appendix E contains the Highway and Drainage Construction Details that will be adhered to, unless 
otherwise agreed with RCTCBC in writing. 
4.7.3. 
No AILs are required for the demolition phase and, therefore, in accordance with Requirement 13(1)(h), it is not 
proposed to undertake a conditions survey of any other sections of highway at this time. If required, such survey 
methodology will be provided in the Stage 2 CTMP for the construction phase.  
4.8 
SOUTH WALES TRUNK ROAD AGENT (SWTRA) 
4.8.1. 
In preparing this CTMP we have had initial consultation with the South Wales Trunk Road Agent (SWTRA) in 
relation to any constraints on vehicle movements we should be aware of with respect to accessing the site from 
the A465 Rhigos Roundabout during the three months demolition stage, such as embargo periods, route traffic 
sensitivity, road works, and any other highway restrictions.    
4.8.2. 
Table 2 contains the embargo periods on road works for 2018 (July to November) and Table 3 contains the 
times of permitted closures, as advised by SWTRA.

4.8.3. 
SWTRA also advised that routine and cyclic maintenance, as well as emergency works, are carried out on an 
as and when basis. 
4.8.4. 
It is considered that the embargo and traffic sensitivity information will not constrain the works during the 
demolition stage of the project given the works programme, but the appointed contractor will maintain contact 
with SWTRA throughout the demolition programme. SWTRA will also be consulted again in the preparation of 
the Stage 2 CTMP for the construction phase.

SUMMARY 
5.1.1. 
Table 4 presents the list of items requiring approval from RCTCBC under Schedule 2 Requirement 13 of the 
DCO. It seeks to set out where this Stage 1 CTMP has addressed each of them were relevant, for ease of 
reference and to demonstrate compliance.  
5.1.2. 
As the demolition phase relates to the DCO only, all of the components of Condition 14 of the HPP Planning 
Permission (Ref: 15/1213/10), relating to the construction of the gas pipeline, will be addressed in the Stage 2 
CTMP. 
Table 4 – Compliance with Requirement 13(1) in this Stage 1 CTMP 
Requirement 13(1) 
Addressed in Stage 1 
CTMP 
(1) No numbered work of the authorised development other than tree felling and 
the bat mitigation structure forming part of numbered work 2E(g) of the authorised 
development is to commence until a construction traffic management plan 
covering that numbered work has been submitted to and approved by the relevant 
planning authority in consultation with Welsh Government Transport. The 
construction traffic management plan is to detail the proposals for the movement of 
construction traffic and abnormal indivisible loads associated with the authorised 
development and is to include- 
- 
(a) construction vehicle routing plans at 1:2,500 scale for all traffic including 
abnormal indivisible loads showing 
Section 3.2 and 
Appendix C 
(i) swept path analysis from the point of entry onto the highway network to 
the Order land; 
Section 3.1 and 
Appendix B 
(ii)highway mitigation in respect of any identified constraints on vehicle 
movements such as embargo periods, route traffic sensitivity, temporary 
road works and other highway restrictions to be developed following 
consultation with the South Wales Trunk Road Agent, and, where relevant, 
referring to supporting HD19/03 safety audit documentation (as contained 
within the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges Volume 5 Section 2 Part 
2 and as amended or replaced); and 
Section 4.8 
(iii)land ownership boundaries for any required holding areas, passing 
areas and layover areas; 
No holding areas or 
passing areas will be 
required within the 
highway network for 
the demolition phase. 
There is space within 
the proposed laydown 
area to hold HGVs 
within the Site itself if 
necessary. 
(b)evidence of appropriate trial runs that demonstrate the suitability of the route 
from point of entry onto the trunk road network to the Order land for the proposed 
types of abnormal indivisible loads; 
Not required at this 
stage as no AILs are 
required for the 
demolition phase 
(c)site access plans at 1:2,500 scale that include supporting HD19/03 safety audit 
documentation (as contained within the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges 
Volume 5 Section 2 Part 2 and as amended or replaced); 
Section 3.2 and 
Appendix D 
(d)proposals for the management of junctions to and crossings of the public 
highway during delivery of abnormal indivisible loads; 
Not required at this 
stage as no AILs are

required for the 
demolition phase 
(e)proposals for the scheduling and timing of movements of delivery vehicles, to 
be developed following consultation with the Welsh Government and potentially 
affected undertakers, and, in relation to any abnormal indivisible loads, details of 
vehicle parameters, number of vehicles in convoy size, dimensions (width, length, 
height) and weight (total vehicle with load and axel loading);  
The scheduling and 
timing of movements 
of “delivery vehicles” 
is relevant to the 
construction phase 
and will be detailed 
within the Stage 2 
CTMP. However, 
timing of movements 
is generally covered 
within Chapter 4 as 
appropriate to the 
demolition phase.  
No information 
required in relation to 
AILs at this stage 
(f)details of escorts for abnormal indivisible loads highlighting where and when 
along the route private vehicles, banksman and Police vehicles escorts will be 
used (including emergency contingencies); 
Not required at this 
stage as no AILs are 
required for the 
demolition phase 
(g)proposals for temporary warning signs and banksman for abnormal indivisible 
loads, including provision of plan drawings and associated traffic signs schedule 
highlighting locations along the route where temporary traffic management 
(including cones and temporary signs) needs to be deployed; 
Not required at this 
stage as no AILs are 
required for the 
demolition phase 
(h)a methodology for undertaking a conditions survey of Main Avenue, Fourth 
Avenue and any other land identified during the trial runs that may have a 
constraining impact on the abnormal indivisible load movements including the 
timescales for undertaking the surveys and the method(s) of reporting the findings 
to the relevant planning authority, comprehensive photographs and potential 
compensation arrangements; 
Section 4.7 
No information
