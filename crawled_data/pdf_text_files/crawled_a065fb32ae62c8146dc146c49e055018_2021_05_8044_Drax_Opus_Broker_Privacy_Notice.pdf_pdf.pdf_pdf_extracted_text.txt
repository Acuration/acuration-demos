Opus Energy (Corporate) Limited is made up of different 
legal entities, including Opus Energy Limited, Opus Energy 
(Corporation) Limited, Opus Gas Supply Limited and Opus 
Energy Renewables Limited. This privacy notice is issued on 
behalf of the Opus Energy Group, so when we mention “Opus 
Energy”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy notice, we are referring 
to the relevant company in the Opus Energy Group responsible 
for processing your personal data. 
Opus Energy provides energy and related services to the

This notice only applies to our use of “personal data” about “data 
subjects” (as defined by data protection law and called personal

relating to our prospective, current and past brokers who 
are sole traders or non-limited partnerships, and contacts at 
corporate customers (“you” or “your”). This notice does not apply 
to information which you provide to us or which we collect 
about corporations (e.g. limited companies). 
We will be the data controller of your personal information 
which you provide to us or which is collected by us from you or 
third parties. This means that we are responsible for deciding 
how we hold and use personal information about you and that 
we are required to notify you of the information contained in 
this notice. It is important that you read this notice so that you 
are aware of how and why we are using such information and 
how we will treat it. 
The information which you provide to us may include 
information about other individuals who are associated with 
the management of your business, the administration of your 
account with us or, including contacts within your business. 
If you provide us with information about such individuals, it is 
important that you provide them with a copy of this notice prior 
to providing us with the information and that you provide them 
with any updated notices we provide from time to time.

Credit checking 
In order to process your application, we will supply your personal

give us information about you, such as about your financial 
history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product 
suitability, check your identity, manage your account, trace and 
recover debts and prevent criminal activity. CRAs will share your 
information with other organisations. The identities of the CRAs, 
and the ways in which they use and share personal information, 
are explained in more detail at:  
http://www.experian.co.uk/crain/index.html**/***. 
Credit Reference Agencies (“CRAs”) collect and maintain 
information about credit behaviour. This includes data sourced 
from the Electoral Register, fraud prevention, and credit 
information - including details of previous credit applications 
and your payment history - and public information such as 
County Court Judgements, and bankruptcies. 
When a credit check is carried out on you, your credit records 
will be searched, along with any financially associated 
individuals such as your spouse or partner when you are a sole 
trader. The CRA will keep a record of this search and place a 
“footprint” on your credit file. 
The information we provide to credit reference agencies about 
you, such as details of false or inaccurate information provided

CHANGE OF PURPOSE  
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for 
which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we 
need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible 
with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal 
information for an unrelated purpose, we will usually notify you 
and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.  
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION 
We may share your personal information with the third parties 
set out below for the purposes described above:  
•  service providers (generally based in the UK) such as those 
who provide IT and system administration services or 
support us in the delivery of any of our marketing materials 
to you (marketing agencies) or provide us with market 
research services 
•  other companies in our Group of companies such as Drax 
Power Limited or Haven Power Limited (based in the UK) 
who provide security, IT and system administration services 
and undertake management reporting and statistical 
analysis to improve our product and service offering
•  if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal 
information in order to comply with any legal obligation), 
requirement of our regulators (including Ofgem), industry 
code, or in order to enforce or apply our contract with you 
•  in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in 
which case we may (where relevant) disclose your personal 
information to the prospective seller or buyer 
•  if we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a 
third party, in which case personal information held by us 
will be one of the transferred assets 
•  to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our 
customers and others. This includes exchanging 
information with other organisations such as fraud and 
theft prevention agencies for the purposes of reducing 
credit risk, fraud and energy theft. 
We require all service providers and Group companies that we 
share your personal information with to respect the privacy 
and security of your personal information and to treat it in 
accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party 
service providers, including Group companies, to use your 
personal information for their own purposes and only permit 
them to process your personal information for specified 
purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 
Most of the personal information we collect about you is 
based in the United Kingdom or in some cases, a service 
provider or their sub-processor may be based elsewhere in the 
European Union (EU) and so, they are required to comply with 
European data protection law. On occasion, we may appoint 
a third-party service provider whose operation or a server or 
sub-processor may be based outside of the EU. As part of our 
Vendor Management Policy, we carry out due diligence on 
our third-party providers and assess whether your personal 
information will be transferred to them or accessed by them 
from outside the EU. If that is the case, we ensure a similar 
degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one 
of the following safeguards is implemented: 
•  we will only transfer your personal information to countries 
that have been deemed to provide an adequate level 
of protection for personal information by the European 
Commission1 ; or 
•  where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer 
personal information to them if they are part of the Privacy 
Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to 
personal information shared between the EU and the US. 
You can view certifications at www.privacyshield.gov2 ; or 
•  where we use certain service providers who are not in 
a ‘adequate’ country or part of the Privacy Shield, we 
may use specific contracts approved by the European 
Commission which give personal information the same 
protection it has in the EU, called an EU Model Clause

Agreement3 . 
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of the EU, 
please contact us using the details set out in the “Contacting 
Us” section at the end of this Notice.

3  Article 46 of the GDPR
STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
We will only keep your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose(s) we collected it for, as 
set out above in this notice, and for as long as we are required 
to keep it for legal purposes. 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal 
information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity 
of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from 
unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the 
purposes for which we process your personal information and 
whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, 
and the applicable legal requirements. 
For example, by law, we have to keep basic information 
about our customers (including contact, identity, financial 
and transactional data) for six years after they cease being 
customers for tax purposes. 
In some circumstances:  
•  you can ask us to delete your personal information, see “Your 
Rights” below for further details; and 
•  we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can 
no-longer be associated with you) for research or statistical 
purposes, in which case we may use this information 
indefinitely without further notice to you. 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to 
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
who have a business need to know that information. They will 
only process your personal information on our instructions and 
they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
personal information breach and will notify you and any 
applicable regulator where appropriate. 
YOUR RIGHTS  
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights 
where we are processing your personal information (but not in 
respect of information about a corporation); to: 
•  request access to your personal information (commonly 
known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you 
to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about 
you and to check that we are lawfully processing it; 
•  request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected; 
•  request erasure of your personal information. This enables 
you to ask us to delete or remove personal information 
where there is no good reason for us continuing to process 
it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your 
personal information where you have exercised your right to 
object to processing (see below); 
•  request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the 
processing of personal information about you, for example 
if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for 
processing it; and 
•  request a copy of your personal information which you have 
provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-
readable format and the right to transfer it, or to require us to 
transfer it directly, to another controller. 
You also have the “right to object” to the processing of your 
personal information where we are relying on a legitimate 
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about 
your particular situation which makes you want to object to 
processing on this ground. You also have the right to object 
where we are processing your personal information for direct 
marketing purposes. 
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights above). 
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for 
access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may 
refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. 
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it. 
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the 
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory 
authority for data protection issues. The ICO can be contacted 
by telephone on 0303 123 1113 or by post as follows: 
Information Commissioners Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, 
Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF or via email at casework@ico.org.
uk. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your 
concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in 
the first instance using any of the details set out below in the 
“Contacting Us” section. 
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICE 
Any changes we make to our notice in the future will be posted 
on our website and, where appropriate, notified to you in 
writing.
