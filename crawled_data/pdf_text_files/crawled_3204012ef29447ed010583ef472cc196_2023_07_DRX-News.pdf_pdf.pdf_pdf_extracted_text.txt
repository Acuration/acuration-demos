Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said: "In the first half of 2023, we delivered a strong
system support and generation performance, providing dispatchable, renewable power for
millions of UK homes and businesses. Drax Power Station remained the UK's single largest
provider of renewable energy by output during the period.
 
"We continue to focus on our role as the UK's leading generator of flexible renewable power and
our ambition to be a world leader in carbon removals. To that end, in the US, we have made good
progress screening options for BECCS projects which can deliver long-term, large-scale carbon
removal and attractive opportunities for growth.
 
"We are excited about the opportunity for BECCS in the UK and are in formal discussions with the
UK Government to facilitate the transition to BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030. Our plans
could create thousands of new jobs in the Humber region, help the UK meet its carbon removals
targets and support long-term energy security."

Notes:
(1)   Financial performance measures prefixed with "Adjusted" are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional
items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (revaluation of deferred tax
balances reflecting future increases in UK corporation tax rates, acquisition costs, restructuring costs and certain
asset obsolescence charges and impairments), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted
EBITDA and EPS measures exclude earnings from associates and amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)   Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, other gains and losses and impairment of non-current
assets, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements, earnings from associates and
earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
(3)   In December 2022, the UK Government confirmed the details of a windfall tax - the Electricity Generator Levy (or
EGL) - on renewable and low-carbon generators, due for implementation in 2023 and running to 31 March 2028.
The levy applies to the three biomass units operating under the Renewables Obligation (RO) scheme and our run-
of-river hydro operations. It does not apply to the Contract for Difference (CfD) biomass or pumped storage hydro
units. Following review, we have concluded that EGL will be accounted for as a levy within Gross Profit and
therefore Adjusted EBITDA. For the remainder of 2023 we will present Adjusted EBITDA including and excluding
EGL for ease of comparison.
(4)   Borrowings including the impact of hedging instruments less cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts
attributable to non-controlling interests.

CEO's review
 
In the first half of 2023 we have delivered a strong financial performance as we continue to play a
critical role supporting energy security through the provision of dispatchable, renewable
generation, from the Group's portfolio of biomass, pumped storage, and hydro assets. Our
purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and we are the UK's largest source
of renewable power by output, a leading source of reliable and flexible generation, and our
ambition is to become a carbon negative company by 2030.
The world must act now to address the climate crisis and limit global warming to 1.5
oC above
pre-industrial levels. We need more renewable energy, more flexible energy systems to make the
best use of intermittent wind and solar energy, and crucially, carbon removal technologies, like
BECCS, to remove carbon from the atmosphere.
In May 2023, we updated on these plans to realise our ambition with opportunities for the
development of over 20Mt pa of carbon removals, 14Mt pa by 2030, as part of a £7 billion
investment plan for US and UK BECCS, pumped storage hydro and an expansion of our biomass
supply chain.
Through our strategy we are creating exciting opportunities for growth and attractive returns
aligned to global decarbonisation efforts. Investments remain subject to the right frameworks
from governments and regulators and will be underpinned by high-quality earnings and cash
flows from our core business, which is delivering for shareholders today, paying a sustainable and
growing dividend and additional returns via a share buy-back, in line with our capital allocation
policy.
Summary of H1 2023
Safety remains a primary focus and, in the first half of 2023, the Total Recordable Incident Rate
was 0.47 (H1 2022: 0.41). As we explained in our 2022 full year results, the increase reflects two
Page 3 of 40
was 0.47 (H1 2022: 0.41). As we explained in our 2022 full year results, the increase reflects two
developments. Firstly, a widening of the scope of reporting to include contractor incidents.
Secondly, improvements in the recording of incidents in our Pellet Production business, including
the Pinnacle sites we acquired in 2021.
We have implemented a health, safety and environmental (HSE) improvement plan across our
North American operations and invested in training, human resource, and capital projects to
deliver improved performance, as well as increased levels of leadership site engagement. We are
committed to a strong safety culture across the Group and remain focused on improving
performance.
Adjusted EBITDA of £453 million (excluding EGL), represents a 101% increase on H1 2022 (£225
million). This reflects a strong system support and renewable power generation performance
across the portfolio, and improved profitability in our Customers business.
We now expect to include the EGL within Adjusted EBITDA and for the remainder of 2023 will
present Adjusted EBITDA including and excluding the EGL. Our full year expectations for Adjusted
EBITDA remain unchanged and in line with analysts' consensus estimates.
Our balance sheet is strong, with total cash and committed facilities of £586 million and Net debt
of £1,274 million.
We expect to propose a dividend for the 2023 financial year of £90 million, a 7% increase on
2022, consistent with our policy to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow. As
has been our practice since we implemented the policy in 2017, 40% of the expected full year
dividend will be paid for the first six months of 2023, £36 million or 9.2 pence per share.
In addition, in May 2023, in line with our capital allocation policy, the Group commenced a £150
million share buy-back programme, which is currently ongoing.
Operational performance
Pellet Production
In North America, our Pellet Production business reported Adjusted EBITDA of £48 million (H1
2022: £45 million). This small period-on-period increase reflects an incrementally higher cost
base offset by higher revenues.
Pellet production was 1.9Mt (H1 2022: 2.0Mt), reflecting forced outages and the temporary
suspension of production at Entwistle due to the plant's proximity to wildfires in Canada. These
factors were partially offset by production at the Demopolis plant.
In June 2023, the loading systems at the Port of Baton Rouge were damaged by high winds,
requiring the use of back-up systems and logistics, increasing costs and restricting the speed of
operations. Repairs are currently underway.
In July 2023, operations at Burns Lake, Smithers and Houston, BC, Canada, were temporarily
suspended due to their proximity to wildfires, and industrial action by longshoremen continues to
disrupt the Ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert, BC, impacting on our Canadian operations.
We continued to see incrementally higher costs associated with in-country transportation and
energy costs, in addition to an increase in maintenance and labour costs, and fibre prices. The
impact of these costs has been balanced by an increase in revenues. We remain focused on
opportunities to reduce the cost of biomass but will balance this against the need to optimise our
supply chain to deliver value for the Group.
In December 2022, the Group took a Final Investment Decision (FID) to develop two new pellet
production projects. The first is a 450kt new-build pellet plant at Longview (Washington State)
that includes the development of a new port facility at the location. The second is a 130kt
expansion of our Aliceville site (Alabama). The combined investment in these projects will be in
the region of $300 million.
The development of the new plant at Longview will provide the Group with access to a new fibre
basket and we will also develop port infrastructure at the Port of Longview, adding a fifth port to
the Group's North American supply chain, with the opportunity to consolidate additional capacity
in the future.
The US Pacific North-West will be the Group's fourth major area of fibre supply alongside the US
Southeast; British Columbia; and Alberta. The new facility is expected to support further
diversification of the Group's fibre sourcing production and export capacity, supporting sales into
Asian and European markets, as well as own-use.
Taken together, existing operations and developments will give Drax a network of 18 pellet
plants (c. 5.4Mt of capacity), with access to five deep-water ports on the East Coast and West
Coast of North America.
Development is underway at both sites, which are expected to be operational by 2025.
We have continued to target opportunities to sell biomass to third parties. In July 2023, we
agreed Heads of Terms with a major Japanese customer for the supply of about 450kt of biomass
pellets over a five-year period, commencing in late 2023.
Generation
Adjusted EBITDA of £457 million (excl. EGL) was an increase of 123% on H1 2022 (£205 million).
This reflects a strong system support and renewable power generation performance across the
portfolio - providing high levels of dispatchable renewable and low-carbon power, and system
support services - offsetting incrementally higher biomass costs.
Our portfolio generated over 4% of the UK's electricity between April 2022 and April 2023 (the
most recent period for which data is available). We also generated 9% of the UK's renewable
electricity over the same period, making Drax the largest renewable generator by output. In
addition, in the first six months of 2023 our assets produced on average 14% of the UK's
renewables at times of peak demand and up to 52% on certain days. This underlines the
important role that Drax plays in security of supply in the UK.
Page 4 of 40
Biomass
The current operating environment increases the importance of appropriate investment to
ensure good operational performance and availability. In July we completed a major planned
outage programme on one biomass unit with a second to commence shortly. The programme
represents a significant undertaking with each outage taking around three months to complete.
In May we also experienced a forced outage due to a transformer on one unit. Through the skill of
our commercial, maintenance and engineering teams we were able to minimise the impact and
return the unit to service.
Taking into account optimisation activities and outages, our biomass units produced around 50%
more power in the winter months (January to March) compared to the summer months (April to
June). Prioritising biomass supplies to generate more in the winter, when demand is higher allows
us to support the UK power system and capture higher power prices.
The process of moving generation and biomass supply between lower and higher demand periods
is not without cost as we incur additional costs associated with buying back and shaping
generation as well as biomass logistics.
Most of the biomass we use is under long-term contracts. However, as we flagged during 2022,
upstream inflationary pressures in certain aspects of our supply chain have led to some cost
increases and we are continuing to see this in 2023. In addition, we have seen an increase in
labour costs at Drax Power Station adding to the fixed cost base of the plant.
Pumped storage and hydro
Our pumped storage and hydro operations - Cruachan Pumped Storage Power Station (Cruachan)
and the Lanark and Galloway hydro assets - performed strongly in the first half of 2023. Together
with the Daldowie energy from waste plant, Adjusted EBITDA was £154 million (H1 2022: £53
million) excluding any EGL associated with hydro generation.
The primary driver of this strong performance was a high level of activity at Cruachan, which
delivered system support services via the balancing mechanism, ancillary services and peak-off
peak power generation. As forward power prices have reduced, we expect a lower level of
Adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2023.The location, flexibility and range of services
Cruachan can provide makes it strategically important to the UK power system. This underpins
our plans for a potential investment in a 600MW expansion of the site, increasing total capacity
to c.1GW. We continue to target operations from 2030. Planning permission for the project was
granted in July 2023.
To move towards net zero, the UK needs to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel generation, like gas.
It also needs to increase the amount of renewables, likely from intermittent wind and solar. In
this context, the role of dispatchable assets like biomass and pumped storage hydro has never
been more important and we believe they represent a long-term part of the UK power mix.
Coal
At the end of March 2023 our remaining two coal units at Drax Power Station closed.
Decommissioning is underway.
OCGTs
We are continuing to construct three new-build Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects at two
sites in England and one in Wales, targeting commissioning in 2024. The three plants will provide
combined capacity of c.900MW and be remunerated under 15-year Capacity Market agreements
(2024 to 2039), in addition to peak power generation and system support services. Capital
investment is in the region of £100 million per plant. We are continuing to assess options for
these assets, including their potential sale.
Customers
Adjusted EBITDA of £37 million was an increase of 54% on H1 2022 (£24 million). In the first half
of this year the business has benefitted from the resale of excess forward hedged power and
lower balancing costs. Similar to the prior period we do not expect this to recur in the second half
of the year.
The primary driver of this improvement is growth in our core I&C supply business, which has
performed well with growth in contracted sales to high-quality customers and the development of
our renewables product proposition.
We see an important role in supporting the decarbonisation of I&C businesses through the
supply of renewable energy, asset optimisation, electric vehicle services, and carbon offset
certificates, which we believe could evolve in the future to the provision of carbon removals.
The business has seen a reduction in bad debt, reflecting our continued commitment to strong
credit controls and the processes which we have put in place.
Carbon Removals - Global BECCS
Our strategy is designed to realise our purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy
future and our ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030. It includes three
complementary strategic pillars, closely aligned with global energy policies, (1) to be a global
leader in carbon removals, (2) to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets, and (3) to be
a UK leader in dispatchable, renewable generation.
In May 2023, the Group hosted a Capital Markets Day which updated on our plans to be a global
leader in carbon removals. Our ambition is to develop over 20Mt pa of carbon removals globally,
with 14Mt pa by 2030, using our expertise with biomass to develop options for BECCS.
Research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's leading
authority on climate science, states that Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods, including
BECCS, are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit
global warming to 1.5oC.
Page 5 of 40
All of the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed by the IPCC use significant volumes of carbon
removals, including BECCS, as a key tool for mitigating climate change. The IPCC has assessed
that globally up to 9.5 billion tonnes of CDRs from BECCS could be required per year by 2050.
Over the past two years, Drax has been progressing a number of work streams to develop its
options for BECCS, with a primary focus on North America. This includes the development of
plans for a new-build BECCS power unit capable of producing c.2TWh pa of renewable electricity
from sustainable biomass and capturing c.3Mt pa. Two initial sites in the US South have been
selected, although the precise details remain commercially sensitive. The two sites combined
could enable the capture of c.6Mt pa of carbon by 2030.
Total investment is estimated to be in the region of $2 billion per plant with a target FID in 2026
and commercial operation by 2030. The capital cost reflects the construction of new-build power
generation as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems.
The design of new-build BECCS enables a wider choice of biomass materials, including non-
pelletised material, such as woodchips. Drax aims to locate new plants in regions which are
closer to sources of sustainable biomass and carbon transportation and storage systems. This is
expected to significantly reduce the operating cost of a new-build BECCS plant compared to a
retrofit, as well as reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain. However, we may need to
source from further afield to ensure consistent access to the volumes of fibre required.
We are continuing to evaluate further sites in North America, with the aim of creating a pipeline
of development opportunities into the 2030s.
We are also assessing options to add a carbon capture process to an existing pellet plant in
Louisiana and developing BECCS projects using existing non-Drax assets, in addition to screening
other regions for BECCS potential, including Europe and Australasia.
Across all of these opportunities we are allocating resources. We now have over 80 employees
working on our Global BECCS opportunities and are opening a Global BECCS headquarters in
Houston, Texas and, as a result, we expect to continue to invest development expenditure as we
progress these opportunities through our project pipeline.
UK BECCS
In March 2023, the UK Government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of
large-scale Power-BECCS projects by 2030 and that the Drax Power Station BECCS project has
passed the deliverability assessment for the Power-BECCS project submission process.
Formal bilateral discussions with the Government are ongoing to move the project forward and
help the Government to deliver its commitment to 5Mt pa of engineered greenhouse gas
removals by 2030. These discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the
current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS at Drax Power Station.
We believe that BECCS at Drax Power Station is the only project in the UK that can enable the
Government to achieve this goal, in addition to the large-scale renewable power and system
support services it provides to the UK power system.
The UK Government has also confirmed that during 2023 it will set out a process for the
expansion of its wider carbon capture and storage programme (Track 1 expansion and Track 2
process).
Policy support for biomass and BECCS
In June 2023, the UK's Climate Change Committee published a report on progress towards net
zero, highlighting that much more needs to be done, as well as recognising the important
contribution which will be required from carbon removal technologies, including BECCS.
In July 2023 we also published our response to the Forum for the Future's report on BECCS Done
Well, which outlined our position on the 30 suggested conditions for the successful
implementation and operation of BECCS.
Capital allocation
The Group's investment opportunities in BECCS - two new-build US BECCS plants, CCS on a pellet
plant and UK BECCS - alongside a 600MW expansion of Cruachan and the addition of c.3Mt of
pellet capacity (to 8Mt of pellet production capacity), represent an investment of c.£7 billion.
Reflecting strong expected cash generation from existing assets and new investments, Drax
could fully fund these opportunities and return to a Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA below 2 times
by the end of 2031, but we will also continue to assess a wider range of funding options,
including project finance.
We remain committed to our capital allocation policy, established in 2017, which has delivered
average annual dividend per share growth of around 11% and provides for the return of excess
capital to shareholders.
Outlook - 2023 and beyond
We are continuing to play an important role in supporting energy security of supply in the UK,
using our supply chain and dispatchable, renewable generation portfolio to provide large volumes
of reliable renewable power and system support services. In this context the strategic importance
of our portfolio and its contribution to the UK power system is clear and will, we expect, have a
long-term role to play as the UK manages the need to decarbonise whilst maintaining energy
security.
Our long-term focus remains on progressing our strategy and our ambition to become a carbon
negative company by 2030, underpinned by the development of BECCS. The potential for the
growth in carbon removals, the opportunity this could afford BECCS in the UK and our plans for
North America are significant, and we expect to make further progress on these options during
2023.
Through these strategic objectives, we expect to create opportunities for long-term international
growth underpinned by strong cash generation and attractive returns for shareholders, and to

We calculate Adjusted financial performance measures, which exclude income statement volatility from derivative
financial instruments and the impact of exceptional items. This allows management and stakeholders to better
compare the performance of the Group between the current and previous period without the effects of this volatility
and one off or non-operational items. Adjusted financial performance measures are described more fully in the APMs
glossary, with a reconciliation to their statutory equivalents in note 6.
 
Throughout this document we distinguish between Adjusted measures and Total measures, which are calculated in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) has been
presented as a separate line on the face of the Condensed consolidated income statement and throughout, particularly
for Adjusted EBITDA, it has been stated whether this is before or after the impact of EGL. Further information on EGL
can be found in the Basis of preparation section of the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Tables in
this financial review may not add down/across due to rounding.
 
*In the comparative period Net debt was presented on a 'before the impact of hedging' basis. However, we consider
including the impact of foreign currency hedges associated with borrowings to better reﬂect the economic reality of
the Group's indebtedness, i.e. to reﬂect the ﬁxed GBP cash ﬂows of foreign currency denominated debt. Thus, all
references to 'Net debt' now refer to the position including the impact of hedging, unless otherwise stated. A
comparison of the measures can be seen in the Basis of preparation section of the Condensed consolidated interim
financial statements.
 
Introduction
Adjusted EBITDA (excl. EGL) of £453 million is an increase of 101% on the comparative period (H1
2022: £225 million). Adjusted EBITDA (incl. EGL) of £417 million is an increase of 85% on H1
2022. EGL charges totalled £35 million in the period, all of which is reflected in the Generation
results. There was no EGL charge in H1 2022. Strong cash generated from operations of £404
million is an increase compared to the comparative period (H1 2022: £185 million).
Total operating profit of £392 million in H1 2023 compares to £207 million in the comparative
period. An increase in gross profit across all business units amounting to £231 million, was
partially offset by an £89 million increase in operating and administrative expenses, as we
continue to invest in the future growth of the Group.
Closing Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA (excl. EGL) of 1.3 times (H1 2022: 2.6 times) is significantly
below the Group's long-term target of 2.0 times. The ratio increases to 1.4 times when calculated
based on Adjusted EBITDA (incl. EGL). The Adjusted EBITDA numbers used to calculate these
ratios are on a last twelve months basis.
Capital expenditure of £210 million compares to £60 million in H1 2022, with £125 million spent
on major strategic projects, including £101 million in relation to the development of our OCGT
projects. We have paused capital expenditure on our UK BECCS project, whilst bilateral
discussions with the Government on support mechanisms are ongoing. Year to date capital
expenditure on this project has totalled £13 million and relates to expenditure which had been
committed in Q1 2023.
The proposed interim dividend of 9.2 pence per share represents a 10% increase on the
comparative period. The Group is committed to paying a sustainable and growing dividend in line
with its long-standing capital allocation policy. In accordance with this policy, on 26 April 2023
the Group announced a £150 million share buy-back programme. By 30 June 2023, £110 million
had been returned to shareholders, with a further £12 million of shares being purchased by 26

had been returned to shareholders, with a further £12 million of shares being purchased by 26
July 2023.
Financial performance
Adjusted EBITDA and EGL
Adjusted EBITDA (excl. EGL) of £453 million (H1 2022: £225 million) reflects growth in all business
units, and an increase in Innovation, capital projects and other costs, as the Group continues to
invest in future growth, including US BECCS opportunities. The EGL charge of £35 million is
entirely attributable to the Generation business. For Group and Generation we state below
whether the Adjusted EBITDA number includes EGL or not, for other business units we do not, as
EGL is not applicable to them.
Adjusted EBITDA of £48 million in the Pellet Production business was a small increase on H1 2022
(H1 2022: £45 million). The business produced 1.9Mt of pellets in the first half of 2023 (H1 2022:
2.0Mt) and shipped 2.2Mt (H1 2022: 2.4Mt). Of the volume shipped, 1.2Mt was to third parties
(H1 2022: 1.0Mt).
Production at our Demopolis site increased period-on-period as commissioning was completed in
H1 2022. We did see an impact at other sites from extreme weather events, which caused
operational challenges. This included wind damage at the Port of Baton Rouge in the US South-
East, and Canadian wildfires which caused the temporary closure of one pellet plant in May, and
a further three in July. We have property damage and business interruption insurance which we
believe should substantially offset the financial impact of such incidents in the Pellet Production
business.
Pellet Production revenues increased by 8%, primarily as a result of higher achieved sales prices
in the period. This increase has been partially offset by higher production costs. The Group
continues to see opportunities for cost reductions in the Pellet Production business.
Generation Adjusted EBITDA (excl. EGL) of £457 million is a 123% increase on the comparative
period (H1 2022: £205 million). The EGL charge for the six months ended 30 June 2023 of £35
million relates entirely to the Generation business. Including EGL Adjusted EBITDA increased by
106%.
The increase in performance was predominantly driven by system support activities and higher
achieved power prices compared to the comparative period, leading to a £285 million increase in
gross margin, before the impact of EGL (£35 million) and increased operating and administrative
expenses (£33 million), largely associated with costs in relation to the major planned outage.
A major planned biomass outage on one of the RO units which commenced in May was
completed in July and there was also a five-week unplanned outage on a separate RO unit during
H1 2023. Despite costs related to buying back power and managing fuel supplies, actions taken
by our commercial and operational teams limited the impact of this unplanned outage. A further
major planned outage is scheduled during the second half of the year. This compares to no major
planned outages during 2022.
Our run-of-river hydro assets at Lanark and Galloway, as well as Cruachan Pumped Storage Power
Station, continued to perform strongly. Combined with the Daldowie energy from waste plant
they contributed of Adjusted EBITDA (excl. EGL) of £154 million (H1 2022: £53 million). This was
achieved through higher levels of generation and achieved power prices, coupled with an
increased value derived from system support services provided to the system operator. A large
proportion of the generation in the first half of the year related to Cruachan, for which hedged
prices in the second half of the year are lower.
In December 2022, the UK Government confirmed the details of the EGL, which applies to the
Group's RO units at Drax Power Station and run-of-river hydro assets, but not the CfD unit at
Drax Power Station or Cruachan. Whilst the legislation bringing this levy into force was not
enacted by the Balance sheet date, it has subsequently been confirmed on 11 July 2023, and its
implementation was deemed virtually certain at 30 June 2023.
The Group has recognised an EGL charge of £35 million, within the Generation results. EGL is
payable at 45% on revenues above a set benchmark level, after deducting an allowance for
increased fuel costs. It is therefore expected that this charge will be higher in periods where
earnings are higher, and for 2023 we expect this to be weighted to the second half of the year.
As EGL has been assessed as a levy for accounting purposes, rather than a tax, it is recognised
within Adjusted results within gross profit.
The end of March 2023 saw the conclusion of the winter contingency coal contract with National
Grid, and with it the end of coal generation at Drax Power Station. All balances related to the
service period have now been settled. As we have separately reported, decommissioning of the
assets is in progress.
Our Customers business generated £37 million of Adjusted EBITDA in H1 2023 (H1 2022: £24
million). This improved performance reflects an increase in energy sales to 10.0TWh (H1 2022:
9.4TWh) and increased value from renewable products, as well as lower than expected system
and renewable costs.
The bad debt charge for H1 2023 of £19 million represents a 27% decrease compared to the
comparative period (H1 2022: £26 million). The overall bad debt provision of £66 million
compares to £61 million at 31 December 2022. Bad debt risk is typically higher within the SME
sector of the business, however we remain vigilant to stresses across the wider portfolio. This
includes our larger I&C customers, and those in the water industry, reflecting a challenging
operating environment.
Our focus remains on developing our I&C and renewables activities, moving beyond supplying
renewable energy and into supporting customers with their broader decarbonisation ambitions.
This includes continuing to grow our fleet electrification and charge point services, and
developing our demand side response product, which enables customers to benefit from
adjusting their consumption during periods of high prices whilst supporting the stability of the
grid. Within our SME activities we are focused on managing both the profitability and risk of the
portfolio.
Page 8 of 40
Innovation, capital projects and other costs of £89 million (H1 2022: £49 million) reflect increased
spend on major projects which have not yet reached the stage of capitalisation, including Global
BECCS and Cruachan II, as the Group continues to invest in its strategic growth plan.
Other costs include the movement in the provision against unrealised profit in the first half of the
year, relating to intercompany biomass sales between the Pellet Production and Generation
business. This cost increased to £9 million (H1 2022: £5 million), reflecting an increase in both
the volume of biomass still held in the Group's inventory, and the sales prices.
Total operating profit
Total operating profit of £392 million is an 89% increase on the comparative period (H1 2022:
£207 million), with the increase in Total gross profit of £231 million offset by an increase in Total
operating and administrative expenses of £89 million reflecting the factors described above.
Total operating profit also includes an additional benefit of £85 million from net adjustments for
certain remeasurements (H1 2022: £130 million benefit) that are not included in Adjusted
EBITDA. The main driver behind the certain remeasurements credit was a decrease in gas prices.
No exceptional costs were recognised during H1 2023 (H1 2022: £27 million).
Depreciation and amortisation decreased by 10% to £109 million (H1 2022: £121 million), with
the main decrease being in the Pellet Production business, as the accelerated depreciation
recognised in H1 2022 has not been repeated to the same level in H1 2023.
Profit after tax & Earnings per share
Total finance costs for H1 2023 totalled £54 million, compared to £7 million in H1 2022. Although
the majority of the Group's debt is at fixed rates, an element is charged at a floating rate.
Increases in rates on the floating proportion of debt led to an increase in the interest charge of
£8 million. The Customers receivables monetisation facility saw an increase in both value (in
response to the higher price environment) and rate, leading to a further increase in charges of £8
million. This was partially offset by a £6 million increase in interest receivable, predominantly on
bank deposits. Foreign exchange losses in the period of £7 million compare with a gain of £28
million in H1 2022.
For interim periods, the effective tax rate is based on the forecast effective tax rate for the full
year. This includes the impact of EGL, which is not allowable for corporation tax purposes,
partially offset by benefits from patent box, research and development credits, and the final
allowances for the 'super-deduction' for qualifying plant and machinery expenditure that ended
in March 2023. The effective tax rate for the period is 28%, which is above both the headline
corporation tax rate in the UK for the year (23.5%, reflecting an increase from 19% to 25%
effective 1 April 2023) and the H1 2022 rate of 19%.
The result of all of the above was that Adjusted basic EPS was 46.0 pence (H1 2022: 20.0 pence),
and Total basic EPS was 61.8 pence (H1 2022: 37.2 pence).
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure for the period was £210 million, an increase of £150 million on the
comparative period (H1 2022: £60 million). Of this, £125 million was on strategic initiatives,
including £101 million on the development of our three OCGT projects. Expenditure on
maintenance projects totalled £57 million, and £28 million was spent on Enhancement, Health,
Safety, Environment and IT.
Development of three OCGT projects continues and they are on track to be operational at the
commencement of their Capacity Market contracts during 2024.
Capitalised expenditure on UK BECCS was £13 million in the period. As previously communicated,
we have now paused further investment as the Group awaits clarity from UK Government on
support for this project. Formal discussions are ongoing, and the Group remains confident in the
prospects for this project.  
Cash and Net debt
Net cash movements
Improved operating cash flows, before movements in working capital and pension payments, of
£399 million (H1 2022: £245 million), reflects the increase in Total operating profit. Careful
working capital management resulted in an inflow of £13 million (H1 2022: £56 million outflow)
and overall Cash generated from operations of £404 million (H1 2022: £185 million). Included
within this, cash collateral showed a net inflow of £51 million, following an outflow of £407 million
in full-year 2022, as underlying trades matured and power prices reduced during H1 2023.
Capital expenditure cash flows for H1 2023 totalled £159 million (H1 2022: £83 million). Cash
flows associated with capital expenditure on the three OCGT projects are significantly lower than
the accounting additions recorded because of the use of deferred letters of credit. The amount
outstanding under these arrangements at 30 June 2023 was £140 million (30 June 2022: £nil).
During the period, corporation tax payments totalled £102 million (H1 2022: £9 million),
reflecting higher UK payments on account in respect of the increased profits chargeable to
corporation tax, and the increase in headline corporation tax rate in the UK from 19% to 25% in
April 2023.
Cash outflows in relation to the share buy-back programme during the period were £110 million
(H1 2022: £nil), with a corresponding increase in Treasury shares.

Cash and committed facilities at 30 June 2023 of £586 million (31 December 2022: £698 million)
provide substantial headroom over our short-term liquidity requirements. The reduction in Cash
and cash equivalents since 31 December 2022 is broadly in line with the cash outflow in relation
to the share buy-back programme. In addition to cash-on-hand, the Group has access to a £300
million ESG Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), a C$10 million RCF and a £200 million liquidity facility,
to manage low points in the cash cycle. The £300 million ESG RCF expires in January 2025, with a
one-year extension clause. No cash has been drawn under this RCF since its inception in 2020,
but £45 million was drawn for letters of credit at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: £46 million
drawn for letters of credit). The £200 million liquidity facility expires in December 2023.
At 30 June 2023 the Group had net cash collateral posted of £183 million (31 December 2022:
£234 million posted) which will be returned to the Group as the associated contracts mature.
During H1 2023, the Group's Issuer Credit Ratings have been affirmed as 'BB+' by Fitch and S&P
and as 'BBB (low)' by DBRS, with a Stable Outlook in each case.
Derivatives
We use derivatives to hedge commodity price and foreign exchange risk. Decreases in pricing in
several of these markets in H1 2023 led to a net £85 million credit related to certain
remeasurements, which we continue to adjust for when presenting Adjusted results. The gains
were predominantly driven by falling gas prices.
Rebasing is a process whereby the rates agreed in a contract are modified to current market
rates. This leads to an initial cash inflow, as the mark-to-market on the contract is settled at the
time of rebasing, with a subsequent outflow in future years, compared to if no action had been
taken. The Group rebased contracts during the first half of 2020 to realise working capital
benefits in light of the developing Covid-19 pandemic. At 30 June 2023, outstanding cash
received from rebased cross-currency swap trades was £nil (31 December 2022: £43 million).
Distributions
In line with our long-standing capital allocation policy, the Group is committed to paying a
growing and sustainable dividend. At the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2023, shareholders
approved payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 of 12.6 pence per
share. This dividend was paid on 19 May 2023.
On 26 July 2023, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June
2023 of 9.2 pence per share (£36 million), representing 40% of the expected full year dividend.
The interim dividend will be paid on 6 October 2023 with a record date of 25 August 2023.
In addition to the proposed dividend, on 26 April 2023 the Group announced a share buy-back
programme totalling £150 million. By 30 June 2023, £110 million had been returned to
shareholders.
Going concern and viability
The Group's financial performance in H1 2023 was strong, delivering improved profitability and a
decrease in Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Our financing platform is stable, with most of our
principal debt repayments due from 2025 onwards and significant liquidity headroom is available
from both committed and uncommitted facilities.
The Group refreshes its business plan and forecasts throughout the year, including scenario
modelling designed to test the resilience of the Group's financial position and performance to
several possible downside cases. Based on its review of the latest forecast, the Board is satisfied
that the Group has sufficient headroom in its cash and committed facilities, combined with
available mitigating actions, to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due across a range of
scenarios. Consequently, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will
Page 10 of 40
scenarios. Consequently, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will
continue in existence for a period of at least twelve months from the date of the approval of the
interim financial statements and have therefore adopted the going concern basis.
The contents of the CEO's review and CFO's financial review were approved by the Board on 26
July 2023.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group's financial and operating performance, as well as the realisation of its strategy, is
subject to various risks and uncertainties. The nature of these risks range from those which are
not directly within the Group's control, such as the wider economic and political environment, or
others which the Group is better placed to influence, such as the development and execution of
our strategy or management of health and safety. We seek to address the potential impact of all
risks faced by the Group through the application of policies approved by the Board and
management, applying the Group's risk management framework and appropriate mitigations.
The Board, as part of its half year processes, considered reports from management reviewing the
Group's Principal risks and uncertainties and how these might evolve during the second half of
2023. This review took account of the ongoing impacts of such issues as the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, and more generally the continued political and macro-economic volatility affecting global
economies. Additionally, developments in regulatory reform and government policy, in relation
to BECCS for example, were evaluated in terms of their potential impact on the realisation of the
Group's strategy and conduct of its operations. Finally, consideration was given to the
operational impact of climate change, which is causing extreme weather-related occurrences in
North America such as the wildfires mentioned above. All of these areas are discussed further
below.
The Group continues to operate in an environment of higher inflation and higher interest rates.
This has the potential to put our customers and suppliers in financial distress and we remain
vigilant to indications of financial deterioration in our key customers or suppliers, so that where
possible, appropriate actions can be taken to mitigate financial or operational exposure on a
timely basis. Over 80% of the Group's outstanding debt currently has fixed interest rates via
hedges. We regularly perform stress tests over our existing debt, considering potential increases
in interest rates, alongside other factors. Such analysis is also incorporated into the final
decision-making process for any future debt issuances and interest rate hedges.
As a result of their assessment, and consideration of the below factors, the Board is satisfied that
the Group's Principal risks, as reported as part of the 2022 Annual report and accounts, remain
materially unchanged and are not expected to materially change in the remainder of 2023. This
includes the risk of significant planned capital construction associated with the execution of our
strategy, which continues to be considered an emerging risk. It is noted, however, that some
risks referenced in the 2022 Annual report and accounts are no longer relevant to the Group, for
example the extended availability of coal-fired units, which ceased in March 2023.
Further details of the Group's Principal risks and uncertainties can be found on pages 78 - 91 of
the 2022 Annual report and accounts, which is available at www.drax.com.
Cyber-security
As reported in the 2022 Annual report and accounts, the Board believes the Russia-Ukraine
conflict has increased risk exposure to attacks on systems operated by the Group and also those
of our suppliers on whom the Group relies for integrity of service. In April 2023, the National
Cyber Security Centre issued an official alert to operators of Critical National Infrastructure that
they face a heightened threat from state-aligned adversaries following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine.
The Group has responded to this heightened risk with additional mitigating actions. However, we
recognise that cyber-attacks are growing in sophistication and complexity, requiring frequent re-
assessment and evaluation of possible responses available to address vulnerabilities.
The scale, pace and nature of exposure also continues to evolve and responding immediately
with commensurate mitigations may not always be possible. As a result of the review performed
in association with approval of this report, the Board has concluded that, whilst there has been
no further material increase in cyber-security risk during H1 2023, it remains significantly higher
than historic levels experienced prior to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Market price volatility and biomass availability
In the first half of 2023, current and forward energy prices have experienced a reduction from
the highs of 2022, on the back of mild weather and reducing risk premiums associated with
European gas storage levels. This reduces the potential impact of having to buy back power in
the market as a result of unplanned outages, and can also present optimisation opportunities.
However, energy prices remain substantially higher than historic long-term averages over the
last decade, indicating a more sustained increase. The associated risk from plant outages
continues to be managed through holding back a proportion of generation capacity as a
mitigation.
The global biomass market remains under pressure, and we continue to see upstream
inﬂationary pressures in certain aspects of our supply chain. While most of the third party
biomass we use is under long-term contracts, we have incurred some additional costs to underpin
the resilience of our supply chain.
This may also result in the Group being exposed to volatile energy prices, as biomass shortfalls
from key suppliers could result in a requirement to buy back previously sold power volumes at
elevated prices, or pay a premium to secure additional biomass. Therefore, the ability of our
suppliers to fulfil contracted volumes continues to be closely monitored. Drax currently has high
biomass stock levels leading into the winter period to mitigate this risk.
The 2022 Annual report and accounts explained that the Trading and commodity Principal risk
had materially increased as a result of heightened energy prices. As a result of the review
performed in association with the approval of this report, the Board has concluded that this risk
remains heightened, as energy prices remain significantly above historic levels and there is
continuing pricing pressure in the biomass market.

continuing pricing pressure in the biomass market.
UK Power-BECCS
In March 2023, the UK Government announced the conclusion of its 'Power-BECCS assessment
process' run in parallel with its 'CCS cluster sequencing process' and determined that the Group
had met the criteria for deliverability with its UK BECCS project. At the same time, they also
announced that their shortlist for Track-1 eligible projects did not include this project, nor any
other CCUS projects in the Humber region due to 'infrastructure constraints'. In the same
announcement the Government stated that they will engage further with the Group following the
assessment outcome and confirmed that they remain committed to achieving 5Mt pa of
engineered Greenhouse Gas Removals (such as those deliverable through BECCS) by 2030.
Since March 2023, the UK Government has confirmed that it will be running a 'Track-1 expansion'
and 'Track-2' cluster sequencing process with the intent of deploying further carbon
transportation and storage infrastructure and projects across the UK (including the Humber
region). Power-BECCS at Drax Power Station is eligible to be selected as either a Track-1
expansion or a Track-2 eligible project with the Government looking to confirm these by the end
of 2023.
The Government is also in the process of developing a business model to support Power-BECCS
projects. In March 2023, they published their response to the Power-BECCS business model
consultation, confirming their intent to design a business model based on a dual CfD approach,
supporting both power and carbon removal revenue streams.
The Government has stated that it will work closely with electricity generators currently using
biomass to facilitate a transition to Power-BECCS, for example via a 'bridging mechanism' to
provide support following the expiry of existing subsidies and the commencement of a Power-
BECCS contract. It is anticipated that the Government's Biomass Strategy will be published
imminently, providing further clarity on the delivery of Power-BECCS, the Power-BECCS business
model, and the bridging mechanism.
In parallel, the Group has been progressing several work streams to develop its options for
Global BECCS, with a primary focus on North America. Two initial sites in the US South have been
selected, although the precise details remain commercially sensitive. The two sites combined
could enable the capture of c.6Mt pa of carbon by 2030. The Group is continuing to evaluate nine
further sites in North America, creating a pipeline of development opportunities into the 2030s.
As a result of the above considerations, the Board does not believe that recent Government
announcements have materially impacted the Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group,
in particular its strategic objectives, but recognises the critical need for clarity if its UK BECCS
project is to continue as planned.
Energy market reform
Global economic challenges such as inflation and volatility in commodity markets have created
the potential for an accelerated timeline of political and regulatory reform, as governments and
regulatory bodies seek to ensure fiscal policy and regulation remain fit for purpose and protect
consumers. To date, this has included the introduction of the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL)
and the launch of the UK Government's Capacity Market consultation, seeking views on proposed
reforms to strengthen the security of supply and provide greater clarity around the transition to
net zero. The UK Government has also opened a consultation on Review of Energy Market
Arrangements (REMA) however it currently remains unclear the scale of the impact of any such
reform. The Government has stated its intention to publish a second REMA consultation in 2023.
Regulators continue to apply a high level of scrutiny to the energy market. This includes ensuring
the use of sustainable biomass, especially in jurisdictions such as the UK where electricity
generation from biomass benefits from public subsidies. This is particularly relevant to the Group
given the potential expansion of the use of biomass for the purposes of BECCS, and we remain
confident in our compliance as regulations continue to evolve.
The EU has now concluded negotiations on REDIII, including an update on their sustainability
criteria for biomass. The outcome maintains sustainability standards, by setting a high bar in
relation to the types of fibre deemed compliant for biomass use, whilst still being workable for
Drax and others. Further policy decisions and publications relevant to biomass are also expected
in 2023, including the UK Government's Biomass Strategy.
Whilst regulatory reform to date continues to align to our current and planned future strategy,
the ongoing focus on sustainability and energy market operation is likely to result in further
political and regulatory scrutiny. We therefore have our internal regulatory compliance processes
under continual review and remain vigilant to any resulting impact on our business model or
future strategy.
Climate change
Over the last 12 months, we have seen an increase in weather-related disruption in the regions in
which we operate, including North America. Severe cold weather through the Canadian winter,
wildfires caused by extreme heat, and hurricanes in the south of the US, have the ability to
cause significant disruption across our North American operations. We continue to consider the
measures available to us in order to mitigate against the operational impact of such weather-
related incidents in addition to safeguarding our employees and protecting our assets.
We hold property damage and business interruption insurance which we believe should
substantially offset the financial impact of such incidents in the Pellet Production business.
However, the impact on availability of fuel supplied to Drax Power Station requires careful
management across our portfolio of self-supply and third-party supply arrangements.
We will continue to monitor the potential operational and financial impact of weather disruption,
but assessments to date do not currently indicate a materially increased risk to the Group.
As a result of their assessment, and consideration of the above factors, the Board is satisfied that
there has been no material change in the Group's Principal risks since their previous disclosure in
the 2022 Annual report and accounts.

Condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Introduction
The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements provide information about the financial
performance (Condensed consolidated income statement and Condensed consolidated statement
of comprehensive income), financial position (Condensed consolidated balance sheet), and cash
flows (Condensed consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company) together
with all of the entities controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group).
The notes to the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements provide additional
information on certain items in the Condensed consolidated income statement, Condensed
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Condensed consolidated balance sheet and
Condensed consolidated cash flow statement. In general, the additional information in the notes
to the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements is required by International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), other regulations or has been included to facilitate increased
understanding of the condensed primary statements.
Basis of preparation
The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting
policies consistent with the United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standards (as
issued by the UK Endorsement Board) and in accordance with UK adopted IAS 34 'Interim
Financial Reporting'. The information provided in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022
does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 but
is derived from those accounts. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered
to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those accounts was not qualified, did not
draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements under Section
498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the going
concern basis and on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that have
been measured at fair value, principally derivative financial instruments, and the assets and
liabilities of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes measured at fair value and using the
projected unit credit method respectively.
See the CFO's financial review for further details on the application of the going concern basis.
The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved by the Board on 26 July
2023.
Adoption of new and amended accounting standards
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's 2022
Annual report and accounts, except for the adoption of new standards, interpretations and
amendments effective as of 1 January 2023. The adoption of new standards, interpretations and
amendments in the current period has not had a material impact. The Group has not early-
adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective
at 30 June 2023.
A full listing of new standards, amendments, and pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these
Condensed consolidated interim financial statements is presented in note 15.
Electricity Generator Levy
In December 2022, the UK Government confirmed the details of a windfall tax - the Electricity
Generator Levy (EGL) - on renewable and low-carbon generators, for implementation in 2023.
The levy applies to the Group's three biomass units operating under the Renewables Obligation
(RO) scheme and its run-of-river hydro operations. It does not apply to the Group's Contract for
Difference (CfD) biomass unit or its pumped storage hydro operations. The EGL applies at a rate
of 45% to receipts from in-scope forms of electricity generation that exceed a defined benchmark
level, after the deduction of certain costs, from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028.
After consideration of the legislation underpinning the EGL, the Group has determined that it
should be treated as a levy under IFRIC 21 'Levies', rather than a tax under IAS 12 'Income taxes'.
Accordingly, the cost is recognised above gross profit. Further, given the quantum of the charge
it was determined that the EGL should be presented as a separate line on the face of the
Condensed consolidated income statement and is included within Adjusted results, to provide
users of the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements with visibility of the charge in
this period. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA including EGL to Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL
can be found in note 6.
In accordance with IFRIC 21, a liability for a levy is recognised once the obligating event, being
the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, has occurred. A liability to pay a levy is
recognised progressively if the obligating event occurs over time. If an obligation to pay a levy is
triggered when a minimum threshold is reached the corresponding liability is recognised only
when that minimum activity threshold is reached. The EGL is triggered based on average
generation receipts for in-scope revenue schemes over a reporting period being higher than the
threshold set in the legislation. A liability is therefore recognised if the average actual generation
receipts to date in a financial period are above the threshold. The current threshold is £75 per
MWh. The assessment is based on receipts above this threshold after adjusting for allowable cost
increases.
Page 13 of 40
As at 30 June 2023 the finance bill that includes EGL had passed its third reading in the House of
Commons and therefore only had the formality of the readings in the House of Lords before
receiving Royal Assent. As such, at 30 June 2023, it was deemed virtually certain to be enacted,
and so a charge and associated liability have been recognised in these Condensed consolidated
interim financial statements. See note 6 for further details on the EGL charge recognised in the
six months ended 30 June 2023. The bill subsequently received Royal Assent on 11 July 2023.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires judgement to be applied in forming the Group's
accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may subsequently
differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Judgements are also reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain appropriate. The Group
reviews estimates and judgements, factoring in any changes or new information, when
determining whether there are any new significant judgements or key sources of estimation
uncertainty, and whether the previously disclosed significant judgements and key sources of
estimation uncertainty are still appropriate to be disclosed as such.
These reviews have concluded that the significant judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty applicable to the preparation of the Condensed consolidated interim financial
statements are the same as those described on pages 178-179 of the Group's 2022 Annual report
and accounts. Particular consideration was given to UK BECCS and the estimate of the useful
economic life (UEL) of property, plant and equipment at Drax Power Station and the judgement
around the capitalisation of UK BECCS project development costs. It was determined these
remain a key source of estimation uncertainty and a significant judgement, respectively. No
changes were required to UELs and relevant UK BECCS costs are still appropriate to be
capitalised, due to the continued expectation of the successful development of the project, as
outlined in the CEO's review.
In each case, judgements have been applied consistently and estimates made using a consistent
methodology, with inputs and assumptions updated to reflect the Group's latest forecasts and
prevailing market conditions at the reporting date as appropriate.
Comparative information
The Group provides comparative financial information in these Condensed consolidated interim
financial statements for both the six months ended 30 June 2022 and the year ended 31
December 2022. Where included within text, Condensed consolidated income statement
comparatives refer to the six months ended 30 June 2022 and Condensed consolidated balance
sheet comparatives are as at 31 December 2022, unless otherwise stated.
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
The Group uses APMs throughout the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements that
are not defined within IFRS but provide additional information about financial performance and
position that is used by the Board and Executive management to evaluate the Group's
performance. These measures have been defined internally and may therefore not be comparable
to similar APMs presented by other companies. Additionally, certain information presented is
derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself a measure defined by
IFRS. Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent IFRS
measure.
Defined below are the key APMs used by the Board and Executive management to assess
performance. The APMs and their definitions are consistent with those presented as at 31
December 2022 apart from following the introduction of EGL, the Group now presents both
Adjusted EBITDA including EGL and Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL. See the APMs glossary table
at the end of this report for full details of all APMs used, the APM's closest IFRS equivalent, the
reason why the APM is used by the Group and a definition of how the APM is calculated. See note
6 for further details and calculations of the Group's APMs.
Adjusted results
The Group's financial performance for the period, measured in accordance with IFRS, is shown in
the Total results column on the face of the Condensed consolidated income statement.
Exceptional items and certain remeasurements are deducted from the Total results in arriving at
the Adjusted results for the period. The Group's Adjusted results are consistent with the way the
Board and Executive management assess the performance of the Group. Adjusted results are
intended to reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group's businesses and are
presented to assist users of the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements in
evaluating the Group's trading performance and progress against strategic objectives.
Exceptional items and certain remeasurements
Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading
performance of the Group in the period. For a transaction to be considered exceptional,
management consider the nature of the transaction, the size of the transaction, the frequency of
similar events, any related precedent, and commercial context. Presentation of a transaction as
exceptional is approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with an agreed policy.
During the year ended 31 December 2022, the application guidance for this policy was
enhanced, in particular, setting de minimis thresholds for classifying items as exceptional. These
de minimis limits were applied during the second half of 2022 and throughout the first half of
2023. The policy has been re-reviewed by the Audit Committee during the six months ended 30
June 2023. This review did not result in any significant changes to the policy.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on derivative contracts to the
extent those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting (or hedge accounting is not effective)
which, under IFRS, are recorded in revenue, cost of sales, interest payable and similar charges or
foreign exchange gains or losses. Management believe adjusting for fair value gains and losses
recognised on derivative contracts provides readers of the accounts with useful information as
this removes the volatility caused by movements in market prices over the life of the derivative.
The Group regards all of its forward contracting activity to represent economic hedges and,
therefore, the contracted price at delivery or maturity is relevant to the Group and its
performance, rather than how the contracted price compares to the prevailing market price, as
the Group is not seeking to make trading profits on these contracts through market price
movements.
The impact of excluding these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and
purchases at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect of delivery of the
commodity in question), taking into account the impact of associated financial derivative
contracts (such as forward foreign currency purchases), in Adjusted results at the time the
transaction takes place.
Further information on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the current and
comparative periods is included in note 6 to the Condensed consolidated interim financial
statements.
Adjusted EBITDA including EGL and Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL
The Group previously presented Adjusted EBITDA. Due to the introduction of EGL the Group now
presents both Adjusted EBITDA including EGL and Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL. Both Adjusted
EBITDA including EGL and Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL are primary measures used by the
Page 14 of 40
EBITDA including EGL and Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL are primary measures used by the
Board and Executive management to assess the financial performance of the Group as they
provide a comparable assessment of the Group's trading performance period-on-period. They are
also key metrics used by the investor community to assess the performance of the Group's
operations.
Adjusted EBITDA including EGL is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, other
gains or losses and impairment of non-current assets, excluding the impact of exceptional items
and certain remeasurements (defined above). Adjusted EBITDA including EGL excludes any
earnings from associates and Adjusted EBITDA directly attributable to non-controlling interests.
Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL is the same as Adjusted EBITDA including EGL apart from it does
not include the cost of EGL.
Adjusted basic earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share (Adjusted basic EPS) is Adjusted profit attributable to owners of
the Parent Company divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the
period. Repurchased shares held in the Treasury shares reserve are not included in the weighted
average calculation of shares. This is the same denominator used when calculating Basic EPS.
This metric is used in discussions with the investor community.
Net debt
The Group defines Net debt as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Borrowings
denominated in foreign currencies, and where the Group has entered into hedging arrangements
associated with this currency exposure, are translated at the hedged rate. This is to take into
account the effect of financial instruments entered into to hedge movements in, for example,
foreign exchange rates in relation to debt principal repayments. Borrowings that have no
hedging instruments attributed to them are translated at the closing rate. Total borrowings
includes external financial debt, such as loan notes, term loans and amounts drawn in cash
under revolving credit facilities (RCFs) (see note 10) but excludes other financial liabilities such as
pension obligations, trade and other payables and lease liabilities calculated in accordance with
IFRS 16. Net debt excludes the proportion of cash and borrowings in non-wholly owned entities
that would be attributable to non-controlling interests. Net debt includes the impact of any cash
collateral receipts from counterparties or cash collateral posted to counterparties.
As noted above, the Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS
16, in the definition of Net debt. This reflects the nature of the contracts included in this balance
which are predominantly entered into for operating purposes rather than as a way to finance the
purchase of an asset. The exclusion of lease liabilities from the calculation of Net debt is also
consistent with the Group's covenant reporting requirements.
Net debt is a key metric used by debt rating agencies and the investor community as a measure
of liquidity and the ability of the Group to manage its current obligations.
In the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements to 30 June 2022, the Group's
definition of Net debt did not include translating borrowings denominated in foreign currencies,
for which the Group had entered into hedging arrangements associated with the currency
exposure, at the hedged rate. The impact of relevant hedging instruments was presented
alongside the Net debt figures rather than being included in the definition.
In the second half of 2022, the Group updated its definition of Net debt to include translating
borrowings at the hedged rate. This is deemed to provide more useful information and to better
reflect the economic reality, as it includes the sterling value of borrowings that will ultimately be
settled.

definitions:

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA including EGL ratio
This metric is the ratio of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA including EGL, expressed as a multiple.
The Group has a long-term target for Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA including EGL of around 2.0
times. This target has not changed as a result of the update in the definition of Net debt
described above, nor have the Group's expectations in regard to meeting this target.
The Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA including EGL ratio gives an indication of the size of the Group's
Net debt in relation to its trading performance and is a key metric used by the investor
community to assess the performance of the Group's operations.
Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL ratio
The Group also presents a Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL ratio to enable readers to
compare, on a consistent basis, the Net debt ratio in prior periods in which EGL was not
applicable.

Notes to the Condensed consolidated interim financial
statements
1.   General information
These notes provide additional information about the disclosures within the Condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. Further information can be found in the Group's 2022
Annual report and accounts on pages 186-276.
Page 19 of 40
Annual report and accounts on pages 186-276.
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act
2006 and registered in England and Wales. The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
Group) have three principal activities:
•     Production and subsequent sale of biomass pellets for use in electricity generation;
•     Electricity generation; and
•     Electricity and gas supply to non-domestic customers.
The Group's activities are principally based within the UK, US and Canada. The address of the
Company's registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North
Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
2.   Segmental reporting
Reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to
the chief operating decision maker, which is considered to be the Board. The Group is organised
into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each. Central corporate and
commercial functions provide certain specialist and shared services, including optimisation of the
Group's positions. The Board reviews the performance of each of these businesses separately,
and each represents a reportable segment:
·      Pellet Production: production and subsequent sale of biomass pellets at the Group's
processing facilities in North America;
·      Generation: electricity generation activities in the UK; and
·      Customers: supply of electricity and gas to non-domestic customers in the UK.
Operating costs are allocated to the reportable segments to the extent they are directly
attributable to the activities of that segment. Central corporate and commercial function costs
that are not directly attributable to the activities of a reportable segment are included within
Innovation, capital projects and other costs. Innovation, capital projects and other costs is not a
reportable segment as it does not earn revenues.
When defining gross profit within the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the
Group follows the principal trading considerations applied by its Pellet Production, Generation
and Customers businesses when making a sale. In respect of the Pellet Production business, this
reflects the direct costs of production, being the fibre, fuel and drying costs, direct freight and
port costs, or third-party pellet purchases. In respect of Generation, this reflects the direct costs
of the commodities to generate the power, the relevant grid connection costs that arise and the
EGL arising on applicable renewable and low-carbon generation. In respect of Customers, this
reflects the direct costs of supply, being the costs of the power or gas supplied, together with
costs levied on suppliers such as network costs, broker costs and renewables incentive
mechanisms.
Accordingly, cost of sales excludes indirect overheads and staff costs (presented within operating
and administrative expenses), and depreciation (presented separately on the face of the
Condensed consolidated income statement).
Seasonality of trading
The primary activities of the Group are affected by seasonality. Demand in the UK for electricity
and gas is typically higher in the winter period (October to March) when temperatures are lower,
which drives higher prices and higher generation. Conversely, demand is typically lower in the
summer months (April to September) when temperatures are milder, and therefore prices are
generally lower.
This trend is experienced by all of the Group's UK-based businesses, as they operate within the
UK electricity and gas markets. It is most notable within the Generation business due to its scale
and the flexible operation of its thermal generation plant.
The Pellet Production business incurs certain costs that are higher in winter months due to the
impact of weather conditions, such as fibre drying costs and heating costs. Production volumes
and margins are typically higher in the summer months. The business is protected from demand
fluctuations due to seasonality by regular production and dispatch schedules under its contracts
with customers, both intra-group and externally.
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group's performance by reportable segment for the six months
ended 30 June 2023. Revenue for each segment is split between sales to external parties and
inter-segment sales. Inter-segment sales are eliminated in the intra-group eliminations column
along with any adjustment required for unrealised profits (primarily inventory in transit from the
Pellet Production segment to the Generation segment at the reporting date).

3.    Revenue
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the
normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and
excludes transactions between Group companies.
During the period, the Group made sales (and subsequent purchases) of Renewable Obligation
Certificates (ROCs) to help optimise the Group's working capital position. External sales of
Renewable certificates below include £253.0 million of such sales (six months ended 30 June
2022: £276.3 million), with a similar value reflected in cost of sales.
To support the Group's ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, a decision was made in January
2023 to phase out the Group's gas supply contracts in the Customers business. Having already
ceased acquiring new gas customers, following internal processes and a regulatory driven 60-day
grace period, no renewal contracts have been offered since May 2023. It is anticipated that the
portfolio will be fully phased out by 2027.
The UK Government introduced the Energy Bills Discount Scheme (EBDS) running from 1 April
2023 to 31 March 2024. Under this scheme, energy supplied to eligible non-domestic customers
will have a discount applied to cap their energy tariff. Certain customers may be eligible for
higher levels of support dependant on the sector in which they operate. The discount provided
can then be claimed back from the UK Government by the supplier.
EBDS replaced the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS) which supported non-domestic customers
between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023. The discounted price of electricity and gas supplied
under both the EBRS and the EBDS is recognised in revenue as it is supplied. The discount
claimed back from the UK Government is recognised within revenue over the same period as the
underlying discounted revenue to which it relates is recognised. The revenue received under
these schemes is included in the EBRS and EBDS income line in the table below. Amounts
recognised under the EBDS are significantly smaller than under the EBRS due to the reduced
level of support provided under the scheme and lower market prices in the period since its
introduction. The Group does not recognise any additional revenue from the schemes than it
would have done if they were not introduced.
For further details on the revenue streams listed below see pages 189-191 of the Group's 2022
Annual report and accounts.
The sources of revenue were as follows:

4.   Net finance costs
Net finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing the debt structure (such as interest
payable on bonds) as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounts on
provisions for reinstatement of the Group's sites at the end of their useful lives, and interest on
lease liabilities. These are partially offset by interest income on the Group's defined benefit
pension scheme plan assets and interest income that the Group generates through use of short-
term cash surpluses, for example through money market funds.

The Group has a number of intercompany loans denominated in the functional currency of certain
foreign subsidiaries, that are owed to a sterling functional currency entity. Due to the
strengthening of sterling during the six months ended 30 June 2023 (six months ended 30 June
2022: weakening), this has resulted in a foreign exchange loss of £16.0 million (six months
ended 30 June 2022: £28.5 million gain) on the retranslation of intercompany loans in the income
statement of the sterling functional currency entity. This loss (six months ended 30 June 2022:
gain) is recognised within the Condensed consolidated income statement and within the Foreign
exchange (losses)/gains included in Adjusted results line in the table above. Conversely, the
foreign exchange gain (six months ended 30 June 2022: loss) on translating the foreign
subsidiaries' intercompany loans into the Group's sterling presentational currency impacts the
translation reserve, with the movement recognised in Other comprehensive income. As such, on
consolidation, a foreign exchange loss (six months ended 30 June 2022: gain) arises in the
Consolidated income statement and an offsetting gain (six months ended 30 June 2022: loss) is
recognised in Other comprehensive income.
5.   Taxation
The tax charge for the period includes both current and deferred tax. The tax charge is based
upon the expected tax rate for the full year, which is applied to taxable profits for the period,
together with any charge or credit in respect of prior periods and the tax effect of any
exceptional items and certain remeasurements (see note 6).
Current tax includes UK corporation tax, corporate income tax in Canada and US income tax. It is
calculated as the income taxes payable on taxable profits, or recoverable in respect of tax
losses, for the period. Deferred tax is calculated as the income taxes payable or recoverable in
future accounting periods in respect of temporary differences which may be taxable or allowed
as deductible. Temporary differences themselves represent the difference between the carrying
amount of an asset or liability in the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements and
the relevant tax base thereon.

This majority of the Group's anticipated full year profit is UK-based. The headline statutory rate of
taxation on UK profits for 2023 is 23.5%, following the rate increase from 19% to 25% effective 1
April 2023. 
The expected full year effective tax rate of 27.5% is higher than the prior year rate of 18.5%. This
is due to the increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023, and the
introduction of the non-deductible Electricity Generator Levy from 1 January 2023. The primary
current tax rate benefits are in respect of UK corporation tax reliefs for the super deduction (until
31 March 2023), patent box and research and development.
6.    Alternative performance measures (APMs)
The APMs Glossary table to these Condensed consolidated interim financial statements provides
details on all APMs used, each APM's closest IFRS equivalent, the reason why the APM is used by
the Group and a definition of how each APM is calculated.
The Group presents Adjusted results in the Condensed consolidated income statement.
Management believe that this approach is useful as it provides a clear and consistent view of
underlying trading performance. Certain remeasurements and exceptional items are excluded
from Adjusted results and presented in a separate column. The Group believes that this
presentation provides useful information about the financial performance of the business and is
consistent with the way the Board and Executive management assess the performance of the
business.
Page 24 of 40
business.
The Group has a policy and framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. All
transactions presented as exceptional are also approved by the Audit Committee. See the Audit
Committee Report on pages 116-126 of the Group's 2022 Annual report and accounts for further
details.
No items have been designated as exceptional during the period. The following transactions were
designated as exceptional items and presented separately during the six months ended 30 June
2022 and the year ended 31 December 2022:
·      Impairment charges incurred on costs associated with the Customers billing system (see
page 238 of the Group's 2022 Annual report and accounts for more information)
(Customers segment).
·      Impairment charges incurred on the application of the Group's accounting policy for
Software as a Service costs consistent with the IFRIC agenda decision (All segments).
·      Impact of UK tax rate change on deferred tax balances (Generation and Customers
segments).
Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that
those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting (or hedge accounting is not effective), and
those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to derivative contracts with a maturity in
future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the maturity of derivative contracts in the current
period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from Adjusted results is to reflect
commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices, i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or
received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, and financial contracts in the
period they are intended to hedge, to reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group in
Adjusted results.
2022 saw high prices and volatility in financial and commodity markets. This resulted in
significant movements in the remeasurement gains and losses on certain derivative financial
instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting, or where hedge accounting is ineffective,
as shown in the table below, principally relating to gas, certain foreign currency contracts,
inflation and oil. In the first half of 2023 prices have reduced compared to 2022 but remain above
historical norms. Further detail on the Group's derivative financial instruments is provided in
notes 12 and 13.

tax rate change between exceptional items and certain remeasurements.
(2)       In the second half of 2022, the application guidance for the Group's policy on determining whether a
transaction is exceptional was updated. This update included setting revised thresholds for designating items as
exceptional. As a result, restructuring costs of £0.5 million and integration costs of £1.1 million designated as
exceptional in the 2022 Condensed consolidated interim financial statements were not designated as exceptional
items in the 2022 Annual report and accounts.

A cost of £35.3 million has been recognised in relation to EGL for the first six months of 2023.
The cost has been recognised within the Electricity Generator Levy line in the Condensed
consolidated income statement. The liability for EGL has been recognised within Trade and other
payables and contract liabilities within the Condensed consolidated balance sheet. No cash
payments have yet been made or fallen due.
Both Adjusted EBITDA including EGL and Adjusted EBITDA excluding EGL are presented below.
Management believe that providing both measures provides useful information, as it enables
readers to compare, on a consistent basis, the current period Adjusted EBITDA to prior periods in
which the EGL was not applicable, and also to see the impact of EGL, which is relevant for
comparison in future periods.

Net debt
Net debt is calculated by taking the Group's borrowings (note 10), adjusting for the impact of
associated hedging instruments, and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes
the share of borrowings and cash and cash equivalents attributable to non-controlling interests.
The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the
principal repayments and interest in respect of the Group's US dollar (USD) and euro (EUR)
denominated debt (see note 13). For the purpose of calculating Net debt USD and EUR balances
are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the reporting date, which
impacts the carrying amount of the Group's borrowings. See the APMs glossary and the APMs
section within the Basis of preparation for further details on the calculation of Net debt.

Further commentary on cash and committed facilities is contained within the CFO's financial
review.
Adjusted EPS is another key APM used by the Group. See note 7 for further details on this APM.
7.   Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits or losses)
attributable to the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding in the period. Basic
EPS is calculated by dividing the Group's earnings attributable to owners of the Parent Company
(profit or loss after tax, excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests) by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares that were outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS demonstrates the impact of all outstanding share options that would vest on their future
maturity dates if the conditions at the end of the reporting period were the same as those at the
end of the contingency period (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes), and
the options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the reporting date. Repurchased
shares held in the Treasury shares reserve are not included in the weighted average calculation
of shares. See note 9 for further details on the Treasury shares reserve. For the purpose of
calculating Diluted EPS, the weighted average calculation of shares excludes any share options
that would have an anti-dilutive impact.

On 26 July 2023, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend of 9.2 pence per share (£36
million), representing 40% of the expected full year dividend in line with the Group's dividend
policy. The interim dividend will be paid on 6 October 2023 and the record date for entitlement to
the dividend will be on 25 August 2023.
Distributable reserves
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability
of retained distributable profits and cash resources.
The Parent Company (Drax Group plc) has distributable reserves at 30 June 2023 of £166.3
million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions
in accordance with the Group's dividend policy for the medium term.
The majority of the Group's distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries.
Management actively monitor the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group,
ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent
Company has access to these reserves.
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £124.9 million are comprised of cash and cash
equivalents that are accessible on demand. The recent history of operating cash generation is set
out in note 11. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group for
treasury management purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other
requirements of the Group.
The Group's financing facilities (see note 10) place customary conditions on the amount of
dividend payments to be made in any given period. The Group expects to be able to make
dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the medium term.
9.    Share buy-back programme
On 26 April 2023, the Group announced the commencement of a non-discretionary and
irrevocable £150.0 million share buy-back programme. This led to the initial recognition of a
liability of £150.0 million, recognised in accruals, with a corresponding reduction to retained
earnings. This reduces the distributable reserves available to the Group by £150.0 million. When
these shares are re-purchased, the liability is reduced and the cost of the shares purchased is
transferred from retained earnings to the Treasury shares reserve. As at 30 June 2023, the
Group had repurchased 19.1 million ordinary shares as part of the programme at a total cost,
including transaction costs, of £110.0 million. These shares are held in a separate Treasury
shares reserve awaiting reissue or cancellation and have no voting rights attached to them. As
at 30 June 2023 the Treasury shares reserve was £160.4 million, made up of £50.4 million
previously held at 31 December 2022 and the £110.0 million repurchased in 2023 as part of the
share buy-back programme.
Subsequent to the reporting date and up to 26 July 2023, a further 2.2 million ordinary shares
have been repurchased for consideration, including transaction costs, of £12.2 million.

(1) These loan notes mature in 2025. Cross-currency interest rate swaps have been used to fix the sterling value of
interest payments. This instrument also fixed the sterling repayment of the principal. This equates to an effective
sterling interest rate of 4.6%.
(2) These loan notes mature in 2025. Cross-currency interest rate swaps have been used to fix the sterling value of

(3) These comprise committed facilities totalling £375.0 million with a range of maturities extending out to between
2024 and 2029. Interest rate swaps have been used to fix floating rates. This equates to an effective sterling
interest rate of 3.3%.
(4) These comprise committed facilities totalling £98.0 million and €126.5 million with a range of maturities extending
out to between 2024 and 2030. Interest rate swaps have been used to fix sterling floating rates on sterling facilities.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps have been used to fix the sterling value of interest payments on euro facilities.
This instrument also fixed the sterling repayment of the principal. This equates to an effective weighted average
sterling interest rate of 2.6%.
(5) This facility matures in 2024 and has a customary margin grid reference over the Canadian dollar offered rate
(CDOR). No interest rate or cross-currency interest rate swaps are in place to hedge the facility, so the Group is
exposed to movements in both floating interest rates and movements in the Canadian dollar.
(6) This is an uncommitted short-term facility. The average fixed interest rate for this facility is 2.4%.
 
The current borrowings of £323.3 million relate to the Group's C$300 million term facility (£179.3
million), £122.5 million of the UK infrastructure private placement facilities (2019) and £21.5
million of the UK infrastructure private placement facilities (2020), all with maturity dates in
2024.
The Group has a committed £300 million revolving credit facility (RCF) and C$10 million RCF. The
Group has never had cash drawings under the £300 million RCF facility since its inception in
2020. The Group also has access to certain non-recourse trade receivable monetisation facilities
and payment facilities, as described in note 11, which are utilised to accelerate working capital
cash inflows and defer cash outflows.
In December 2022, the Group secured a new £200 million committed liquidity facility with banks
within its lending group. This facility provides an additional source of liquidity to the Group's
existing undrawn RCFs, until December 2023. At 30 June 2023 £nil was drawn (31 December
2022: £nil). The Group has a €50 million uncommitted facility that has €nil drawn at 30 June 2023
(31 December 2022: €50 million).
The Group has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities during the current
period and prior year. The Group has significant headroom and expects to continue to comply
with these financial covenants in future periods under all reasonably possible downside scenarios.
The weighted average interest rate payable at the reporting date on the Group's borrowings was
4.65% (as at 31 December 2022: 4.14%).

(1)    Certain remeasurements of derivative contracts includes the effect of non-cash unrealised gains and losses
recognised in the Condensed consolidated income statement and their subsequent cash realisation. It also includes
the cash and non-cash impact on deferring and recycling gains and losses on derivative contracts designated into
hedge relationships under IFRS 9, where the gain or loss is held in the hedge reserve and then released to the
Condensed consolidated income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. The £95.1 million
reduction (six months ended 30 June 2022: £136.8 million reduction) for certain remeasurements of derivative
contracts in the current period predominantly relates to maturing trades where the mark-to-market losses on these
trades had been recognised in prior periods. At 30 June 2023 the Group had accelerated £nil of cash flows through
the use of rebasing (as at 31 December 2022: £43.1 million).
(2)    The £126.2 million decrease in collateral received in the prior period has been re-presented. Previously this was
included in the movement in receivables as a £4.8 million decrease in receivables and movement in payables as a
£131.0 million decrease in payables.
 
The Group has generated cash from operations of £404.3 million during the period (six months
ended 30 June 2022: £185.4 million). This resulted from a cash inflow from operating activities
before working capital of £399.3 million (six months ended 30 June 2022: £244.8 million inflow)
and a net working capital inflow of £13.3 million (six months ended 30 June 2022: £56.0 million

outflow). This was offset by an £8.3 million (six months ended 30 June 2022: £3.4 million) cash
outflow in respect of pension obligations.
The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and managing liquidity, and actively
manages its working capital position to ensure that the amount committed is closely aligned with
operational requirements. The most significant factors making up the movement in working
capital during the period are explained in further detail below.  
The £32.2 million cash inflow due to a decrease in inventory in the six months ended 30 June
2023 (six months ended 30 June 2022: £75.2 million outflow) is mainly attributable to a reduction
in the average cost per tonne of biomass in inventory at 30 June 2023 compared to 31 December
2022.
The £201.5 million cash inflow due to a decrease in receivables in the six months ended 30 June
2023 (six months ended 30 June 2022: £32.8 million cash outflow due to an increase in
receivables) is the result of lower power prices across the Generation and Customers businesses.
The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows
associated with amounts receivable from energy supply customers on a non-recourse basis. The
Group refinanced this facility in the prior year, extending the maturity to January 2027 and
increasing the size of the facility to £300.0 million from £200.0 million. The Group also agreed a
further increase in the limit, from £300.0 million to £400.0 million, for the period November 2022
to January 2024. Utilisation of the facility was £400.0 million at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022:
£400.0 million). As the facility was fully utilised at 31 December 2022 and 30 June 2023 this has
had no cash flow impact in the period (six months ended 30 June 2022: £100.0 million cash
inflow).
During the six months ended 30 June 2023, there was a £33.3 million cash inflow from an
increase in payables during the six months ended 30 June 2023 (six months ended 30 June 2022:
£233.8 million cash inflow due to an increase in payables).
The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base resulting in certain
suppliers extending payment terms and some reducing terms. The Group's suppliers are able to
access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be accelerated in
advance of the normal payment terms. At 30 June 2023, the Group had trade payables of £23.2
million (31 December 2022: £53.9 million) related to reverse factoring. This facility does not
directly impact the Group's working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the Group,
and would remain the same should the facility fall away.
The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in
transaction processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short
extension of payment terms of less than 12 months. The amount outstanding under these
facilities as at 30 June 2023 was £252.8 million (31 December 2022: £214.5 million) resulting in a
net cash inflow of £38.3 million in the period (six months ended 30 June 2022: £3.2 million net
cash outflow). Utilisation of these payment facilities has reduced the cash outflow in the
purchases of property, plant and equipment line in the Condensed consolidated cash flow
statement by £30.4 million during the period (six months ended 30 June 2022: £17.1 million) with
the remaining £7.9 million (six months ended 30 June 2022: offsetting £20.3 million) movement
being within the overall change in working capital shown above.
The Group has had a net cash inflow of £51.0 million during the six months ended 30 June 2023
due to collateral (six months ended 30 June 2022: £126.2 million outflow). 2022 saw high prices
and volatility in financial and commodity markets. Prices have reduced during 2023 but remain
above historical norms. Cash collateral is sometimes paid or received in relation to the Group's
commodity and treasury trading activities. When derivative positions are out of the money for
the Group, collateral may be required to be paid to the counterparty. When derivative positions
are in the money, collateral may be received from counterparties. These positions reverse when
contracts are settled and the collateral is returned.
The Group actively manages the liquidity requirements, including collateral, associated with the
hedging of power and other commodities. In addition, the design of the Group's trading
agreements and methods of posting collateral, such as being able to utilise letters of credit and
surety bonds to meet collateral requirements, aims to minimise cash outflows resulting from
collateral requirements where possible. At 30 June 2023 the Group held £16.4 million in cash
collateral receipts (31 December 2022: £nil) recognised in payables and had posted £199.4
million (31 December 2022: £234.0 million) of cash collateral payments recognised in
receivables. The Group also had £15.0 million (31 December 2022: £54.5 million) of letters of
credit and £110.0 million (31 December 2022: £165.0 million) of surety bonds utilised covering
commodity trading collateral requirements. Letters of credit and surety bonds utilised reduce the
requirement for cash collateral payments.
There has been a £299.4 million cash outflow (six months ended 30 June 2022: £55.6 million cash
outflow) due to renewable certificates. This is predominantly due to additional renewable
certificates generated in the period of £287.0 million (six months ended 30 June 2022: £279.3
million) that have not yet been sold onto third parties as cash from renewable certificate assets,
and in particular ROCs, is realised several months after the end of the compliance period, which
runs from April to March the following year. However, the Group has standard ROC sales and ROC
purchase agreements in place to enable it to accelerate these cash flows over a portion of these
assets. The net impact of these ROC purchases and ROC sales on operating cash flows for the six
months ended 30 June 2022 was a £31.9 million outflow (six months ended 30 June 2022: £146.4
million inflow). At 30 June 2023 the Group had accelerated £299.3 million of cash flows using
these standard ROC sales (31 December 2022: £331.2 million).
12.  Financial risk management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk,
foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, inflation risk, counterparty risk and credit
risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of
commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group's
financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk
management is overseen by the Risk management committees which identify, evaluate and
manage financial risks in close coordination with the Group's trading and treasury functions
under policies approved by the Board of directors.

under policies approved by the Board of directors.
2022 saw high prices and volatility in financial and commodity markets, in part due to the
conflict in Ukraine. This volatility impacted economies and markets around the world, including
the UK energy market, which has in part contributed to rising inflation. Commodity prices have
reduced during 2023, but remain above historical norms, whilst sterling has strengthened. The
geopolitical environment and concerns over the macro-economic outlook have also contributed to
ongoing volatility in currency markets. See the Principal risks and uncertainties section for further
details on market price volatility and how macro-economic conditions have impacted the Group.
As a result of these factors, the Group's derivative financial instrument balances, in particular
power, gas, foreign currency contracts and oil, have reduced compared to the elevated levels
seen in 2022, which can be seen within note 13 below.
See pages 257-270 of the Group's 2022 Annual report and accounts for further details on the
Group's financial risk management.
13.  Fair value financial instruments
The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to the financial
risks set out in note 12.
The own-use exemption applies to certain commodity contracts that are entered into for the
purpose of physical receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale
or usage requirements. Other contracts are outside the scope of IFRS 9 as there is not a
sufficiently liquid market for the commodity to bring the contracts into scope. In both cases,
these contracts are excluded from the requirement to apply fair value mark-to-market
accounting. 
Contracts that do not meet the requirements of the own-use exemption, and fall within the scope
of IFRS 9, are accounted for as derivatives and are recorded in the Condensed consolidated
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are
reflected through Other comprehensive income within the Condensed consolidated statement of
comprehensive income to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in
accordance with IFRS 9, or in the Condensed consolidated income statement where the hedge
accounting requirements are not met, or the hedges are ineffective. To ensure the movements
on these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are
excluded from Adjusted results in the Condensed consolidated income statement until the
contract matures.
For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into
five categories:
·      Commodity contracts - forward contracts for the sale or purchase of a commodity which is
expected to be settled through physical delivery.
·      Financial contracts - contracts for commodities that are not expected to be settled
through physical delivery of the commodity, as well as weather-related contracts.
·      Foreign currency exchange contracts - currency related contracts including forwards,
swaps, vanilla options and structured option products.
·      Interest rate and cross-currency contracts - contracts which swap one interest rate for
another in a single currency, including floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, and contracts
which swap interest and principal cash flows in one currency for another currency,
including fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps.
·      Inflation rate swaps - swap contracts, such as floating-to-fixed, which are linked to an
inflation index such as the Retail Price Index (RPI) or the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and
inflation swaptions.

IFRS 13 requires categorisation of the Group's financial instruments in accordance with the
following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which their fair values have been determined:
·      Level 1 - Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Page 33 of 40
·      Level 2 - Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted
prices, included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
·      Level 3 - Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that
include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).
 
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or
liability.
The table below details the carrying amounts of fair value financial instruments including their
levels in the fair value hierarchy:

There have been no transfers during the period between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
During the period, the Level 3 equity investment was reclassified to investments in associates
following a further investment by the Group. The investment is now accounted for under the
equity method in accordance with IAS 28 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures'.
The Group has a large portfolio of commodity and financial contracts (including forward power
sales, gas purchases and financial oil purchases) and also has a large portfolio of forward
currency contracts which fix the sterling cost of future fuel purchases denominated in foreign
currencies. The Group has entered into a number of inflation swap contracts in order to hedge
annual price increases in certain elements of its generation activities, such as its CfD revenue
and Capacity Market revenue, both linked to UK CPI.
Fair value measurement
·      Commodity contracts - the fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for
the own-use exemption, or are otherwise outside of the scope of IFRS 9, is calculated by
reference to forward market prices at the reporting date.
·      Financial contracts - the fair value of financial contracts is calculated by reference to
forward market prices at the reporting date.
·      Foreign currency exchange contracts - the fair value of foreign currency exchange
contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the reporting
date.
·      Interest rate contracts - the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to
forward market curves at the reporting date for the relevant interest index.
·      Cross-currency interest rate swap contracts - the fair value of cross-currency interest rate
swaps is calculated using the relevant forward currency exchange market rates for fixed-
to-fixed swaps and by using the relevant forward currency exchange market rates and
interest index for floating-to-fixed swaps.
·      Inflation rate contracts - the fair value of inflation rate swaps is calculated by reference to
forward market curves at the reporting date for the relevant inflation index.
 
Given the maturity profile of all these contracts, liquid forward market price curves are available
for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect both the time value
of money and credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The fair value of commodity contracts, financial contracts, foreign currency exchange contracts,
interest rate contracts, cross-currency contracts and inflation swaps are largely determined by
comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are
categorised as Level 2.
Level 3 fair values
The fair value of the Group's UK CPI inflation swaps comprises an RPI and CPI component. Whilst
the RPI component is based on observable market rates, CPI is based on unobservable rates and
therefore deemed to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. However, this component is not
material to the overall valuation and therefore the instruments as a whole have been classified
as Level 2.
The contingent consideration receivable by the Group relates to the sale of the Combined Cycle
Gas Turbine (CCGT) portfolio in 2021. The gross nominal value of £29.0 million is contingent on
certain triggers in respect of the option to develop the Damhead Creek 2 land disposed of as part
of the sale of these assets. The fair value measurement for the contingent consideration has
been categorised as Level 3 based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used. The fair value
was measured at £27.4 million as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: £27.4 million) and there
have been no significant changes to the inputs or valuation techniques used since 31 December
Page 34 of 40
have been no significant changes to the inputs or valuation techniques used since 31 December
2022. Further details on the valuation process, the valuation technique used, the Level 3 inputs
and sensitivities can be found on pages 254-255 of the Group's 2022 Annual report and accounts.
14.  Contingent assets and contingent liabilities
Contingent assets are potential future inflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that
is outside of the control of the Group. The amount or timing of any receipt is uncertain and
cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event
that is outside of the control of the Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and
cannot be measured reliably.
The contingent assets and liabilites are consistent with those disclosed in the Group's 2022
Annual report and accounts apart from the changes to contingent liabilities noted below:
Smart meter targets
In late February 2023, the Group received notice from Ofgem that its failure to fully achieve
installation targets for Smart meter installations in the Opus Energy business during 2022 had
been referred to Ofgem's Enforcement team. The Group subsequently received confirmation from
Ofgem that no enforcement action will be taken in relation to this matter.
Ofgem investigation
On 31 May 2023, Ofgem announced the opening of an investigation into Drax Power Limited's
annual biomass profiling reporting under the Renewables Obligation scheme. Ofgem's
announcement stated that the opening of an investigation does not imply any finding of non-
compliance. Ofgem separately confirmed that they have not established any non-compliance that
would affect the issuance of ROCs to Drax Power Limited, and therefore the associated financial
benefit.
Like all energy generators, the Company receives regular requests from Ofgem. We continue to
cooperate fully throughout the investigation and have confidence in our compliance with the
Renewables Obligation critera.
15.  Adoption of new and amended accounting standards
The following amendments became effective for the first time in 2023:
·      IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts - effective from 1 January 2023.
·      IAS 1 (amended) - Disclosure of Accounting Policies - effective from 1 January 2023.
·      IAS 8 (amended) - Definition of Accounting Estimates - effective from 1 January 2023.
·      IAS 12 (amended) - Income Taxes - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising

·      IAS 12 (amended) - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules - effective from 1
January 2023.
 
The adoption of these amendments in the current period has not had a material impact.
At the date of approval of this report, the following new or amended standards and relevant
interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not
yet effective:
·      IFRS 10 (amended) - Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) -
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) - effective date deferred indefinitely.
·      IAS 1 (amended) - Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current - effective from 1
January 2024.*
·      IFRS 16 (amended) - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - effective from 1 January
2024.

January 2024.*
  
*Pending endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB).
 
Adoption of new or amended standards and relevant interpretations in future periods is not
expected to have a material impact on the Condensed consolidated interim financial statements
of the Group.

Independent review report to Drax Group Plc
Conclusion
We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of ﬁnancial statements in
the half-yearly ﬁnancial report for the six months ended 30 June 2023 which comprises the
income statement, statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of
changes in equity, the cash flow statement, and related notes 1 to 16.
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
condensed set of ﬁnancial statements in the half-yearly ﬁnancial report for the six months ended
30 June 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with United Kingdom
adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
Basis for Conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity" issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (ISRE (UK) 2410).
A review of interim ﬁnancial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for ﬁnancial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all signiﬁcant matters that might be identiﬁed in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
As disclosed above, the annual ﬁnancial statements of the group are prepared in accordance
with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The condensed set of ﬁnancial
statements included in this half-yearly ﬁnancial report has been prepared in accordance with
United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting".
Conclusion Relating to Going Concern
Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as
described in the Basis for Conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to
suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or
that the directors have identiﬁed material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not
appropriately disclosed.
This Conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410;
however future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going
concern.
Responsibilities of the directors
The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct
Authority.
In preparing the half-yearly financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the
group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to
liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the review of the financial information
In reviewing the half-yearly financial report, we are responsible for expressing to the group a
conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report. Our
Page 36 of 40
conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report. Our
Conclusion, including our Conclusion Relating to Going Concern, are based on procedures that
are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for Conclusion paragraph of
this report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. Our work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to it in
an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our review
work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.

Alternative performance measures (APMs) glossary table
The measures described below are used throughout the Condensed consolidated interim financial
statements and are measures that are not defined within IFRS but provide additional information
about financial performance and position that is used by the Board and Executive management
to evaluate the Group's trading performance. These measures have been defined internally and
may therefore not be comparable to APMs presented by other companies. Additionally, certain

Adjusted
results
Total results
The Group's Adjusted results
are consistent with the way
the Board and Executive
management assess the
performance of the Group.
Adjusted results are intended
to reflect the underlying
trading performance of the
Group's businesses and are
presented to assist users of
the Condensed consolidated
interim financial statements in
evaluating the Group's trading
performance and performance
against strategic objectives on
a consistent basis.
Adjusted results exclude
exceptional items and certain
remeasurements.
Exceptional items are those
transactions that, by their
nature, do not reflect the
trading performance of the
Group in the period.
Certain remeasurements
comprise fair value gains and
losses that do not qualify for
hedge accounting (or hedge
accounting is not effective).
The Group regards all of its
forward contracting activity to
represent economic hedges
and therefore by excluding
the volatility caused by
recognising fair value gains
and losses prior to maturity of
the contracts, the Group can
reflect these contracts at the
contracted prices on maturity,
reflecting the intended
purpose of entering these
contracts and the Group's
underlying performance.
Adjusted results are the
metrics used in the calculation
of Adjusted basic and Adjusted
diluted EPS.
Total results measured in
accordance with IFRS
excluding the impact of
exceptional items and certain
remeasurements (defined in
note 6).
Adjusted
EBITDA

and
 
Adjusted
EBITDA
excluding EGL
Operating
profit*
Adjusted EBITDA including EGL
is a primary measure used by
the Board and Executive
management to assess the
financial performance of the
Group as it provides a more
comparable assessment of the
Group's period-on-period
trading performance. It is also
a key metric used by the
investor community to assess
performance of the Group's
operations.
The Group presents Adjusted
EBITDA excluding EGL to
enable readers to compare, on
a consistent basis, the
Adjusted EBITDA in prior
Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation,
other gains and losses and
impairment of non-current
assets, excluding the impact
of exceptional items and
certain remeasurements
(defined in note 6). Adjusted
EBITDA including EGL includes
the cost of EGL and excludes
any earnings from associates
or attributable to non-
controlling interests.
Adjusted EBITDA excluding
EGL is Adjusted EBITDA
including EGL, less the cost of
EGL.

Adjusted EBITDA in prior
periods in which EGL was not
applicable.
Adjusted basic
EPS
Basic EPS
Adjusted basic EPS represents
the amount of Adjusted
earnings (Adjusted post-tax
earnings) attributable to each
ordinary share.
Adjusted basic EPS is
calculated by dividing the
Group's Adjusted earnings
attributable to owners of the
Parent Company (Adjusted
profit after tax) by the
weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding
during the period.
Adjusted
diluted EPS
Diluted EPS
Adjusted diluted EPS
demonstrates the impact upon
the Adjusted basic EPS if all
outstanding share options,
that are expected to vest on
their future maturity dates
and where the shares are
considered to be dilutive, were
exercised and treated as
ordinary shares as at the
reporting date.
Adjusted diluted EPS is
calculated by dividing the
Group's Adjusted earnings
attributable to owners of the
Parent Company (Adjusted
profit after tax) by the
weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding
during the period and dilutive
potential ordinary shares
outstanding under share
plans.
Net debt
Borrowings
less cash and
cash
equivalents
Net debt is a key measure of
the Group's liquidity and its
ability to manage current
obligations.
Net debt is used as a basis by
debt rating agencies and in
the calculation of the Group's
financial covenant
requirements.
The impact of hedging
instruments included within
Net debt shows the economic
substance of the Net debt
position, in terms of actual
expected future cash flows to
settle that debt.
Total borrowings including the
impact of hedging instruments
less cash and cash
equivalents.
Total borrowings include
external financial debt, such
as loan notes, term loans and
amounts drawn in cash under
RCFs but excludes other
financial liabilities such as
lease liabilities calculated in
accordance with IFRS 16,
pension obligations and trade
and other payables. Net debt
excludes the proportion of
cash and borrowings in non-
wholly owned entities that
would be attributable to non-
controlling interests.
Net debt includes the impact
of foreign currency hedging
instruments, meaning that any
borrowings that have
associated hedging
instruments in place are
adjusted to reflect those
borrowings at the hedged
rate.
Net debt includes the impact
of any cash collateral receipts
from counterparties or cash
collateral posted to
counterparties.

profit*
The Net debt to Adjusted
EBITDA including EGL ratio is a
debt ratio that gives an
indication of how many years
it would take the Group to pay
back its debt if Net debt and
Adjusted EBITDA including EGL
are held constant.
The Group has a long-term
target for Net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA including EGL
ratio of around 2.0 times.
The Group presents a Net debt
to Adjusted EBITDA excluding
EGL ratio to enable readers to
compare, on a consistent
basis, the Net debt ratio in
prior periods in which EGL was
not applicable.
Net debt divided by Adjusted
EBITDA including/excluding
EGL for the last twelve
months. Expressed as a
multiple.
Cash and
committed
facilities
Cash and cash
equivalents
This is a key measure of the
Group's available liquidity and
the Group's ability to manage
its current obligations.
It shows the value of cash
available to the Group in a
short period of time.
Total cash and cash
equivalents plus the value of
the Group's committed but
undrawn facilities (including
the Group's RCFs, loan
facilities and the Customers
trade receivable factoring
facility).
Capital

additions
Used to show the Group's
total investment in PPE and
intangible assets in a period.
PPE additions plus intangible
asset additions.
* Operating profit is presented on the Group's Condensed consolidated income statement; however, it is not defined
per IFRS. It is a generally accepted measure of profit.
 
 
Glossary
Ancillary services
Services provided to National Grid used for balancing supply and demand or maintaining secure
electricity supplies within acceptable limits, for example Black start contracts. They are described
in Connection Condition 8 of the Grid Code.

Availability
Average percentage of time the units were available for generation.
BECCS
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, with carbon resulting from power generation
captured and stored.
Black start
Procedure used to restore power in the event of a total or partial shutdown of the national
electricity transmission system.
Biomass
Organic material of non-fossil origin, including organic waste, that can be converted into
bioenergy through combustion. The Group uses low-grade roundwood, sawmill residues and
forest residues in the form of compressed wood pellets, to generate electricity at Drax Power
Station or to sell the pellets to third parties.
Capacity Market
Part of the UK Government's Electricity Market Reform, the Capacity Market is intended to ensure
security of electricity supply by providing a payment for reliable sources of capacity.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS)
The process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a large-scale source and then permanently storing them.
 
CCUS
Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage.
CDRs
Carbon dioxide removals.
 
Contracts for Difference (CfD)
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by
stabilising revenues for generators at a fixed price level known as the 'strike price'. Generators
will receive revenue from selling their electricity into the market as usual, however, when the
market reference price is below the strike price they will also receive a top-up payment for the
additional amount. Conversely, if the market reference price is above the strike price, the
generator must pay back the difference.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT)
A form of energy generation technology that combines a gas-fired turbine with a steam turbine.
Dispatchable power
An electricity generator produces dispatchable power when the power can be ramped up or
down, and switched on or off, at short notice to provide a flexible response to changes in
electricity demand. Biomass, pumped storage, coal, oil, and gas electricity generation can meet
these criteria and hence can be dispatchable power sources. Nuclear can be dispatched against
an agreed schedule but is not flexible. Wind and solar electricity cannot be scheduled and hence
are not dispatchable. An electricity system requires sufficient dispatchable power to operate and
remain safe.
