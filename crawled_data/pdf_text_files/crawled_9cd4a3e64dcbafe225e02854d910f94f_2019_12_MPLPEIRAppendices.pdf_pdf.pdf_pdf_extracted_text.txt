Policy and Guidance 
2.6 – Air Quality 
The Air Quality Strategy 
The Air Quality Strategy (2007) establishes the policy framework for ambient air 
quality management and assessment in the UK. The primary objective is to ensure 
that everyone can enjoy a level of ambient air quality which poses no significant risk 
to health or quality of life. The Strategy sets out the National Air Quality Objectives 
(NAQOs) and Government policy on achieving these objectives. 
The relevant NAQOs for Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) are prescribed in the 
Air Quality (England) Regulations 2000 and the Air Quality (Amendment) (England) 
Regulations 2002. The objectives for the protection of human health are summarised, 
as appropriate to the Project, in Table 2-6.1. 
Table 2.6.1:  Air Quality Objectives for the protection of human health

Where an objective is unlikely to be met, the local authority must designate an Air 
Quality Management Area (AQMA) and draw up an Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) 
setting out the measures it intends to introduce in pursuit of the objectives within its 
AQMA. 
The Local Air Quality Management Technical Guidance 2009 (LAQM.TG(09); Defra, 
2009) issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for 
Local Authorities provides advice as to where the NAQOs apply. These include 
outdoor locations where members of the public are likely to be regularly present for 
the averaging period of the objective (which vary from 15 minutes to a year). Thus, 
for example, annual mean objectives apply at the façades of residential properties, 
whilst the 24-hour objective (for PM10) would also apply within the garden. They do 
not apply to occupational, indoor or in-vehicle exposure. 
EU Limit Values 
The Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 implements the European Union’s 
Directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (2008/50/EC), and 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
includes limit values for NO2. These limit values are numerically the same as the 
NAQO values but differ in terms of compliance dates, locations where they apply and 
the legal responsibility for ensuring that they are complied with. The compliance date 
for the NO2 EU Limit Value was 1 January 2010, five years later than the date for the 
NAQO.  
Directive 2008/50/EC consolidated the previous framework directive on ambient air 
quality assessment and management and its first three daughter directives. The limit 
values remained unchanged, but it now allows Member States a time extension for 
compliance, subject to European Commission (EC) approval. Despite many areas of 
the UK not being compliant with the annual average NO2 limit value, the UK has 
decided not to seek an extension to the compliance date for this pollutant. This was 
on the basis that it could not be guaranteed that the UK would be compliant by the 
latest date allowable under the Directive (1 January 2015). 
The Directive limit values are applicable at all locations except: 
• 
Where members of the public do not have access and there is no fixed 
habitation;  
• 
On factory premises or at industrial installations to which all relevant provisions 
concerning health and safety at work apply; and 
• 
On the carriageway of roads; and on the central reservations of roads except 
where there is normally pedestrian access.  
Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 
Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and 
control) (IED) recast seven directives related to industrial emissions, in particular 
Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention 
and control (the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive) and 
Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain 
pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the Large Combustion Plant 
Directive (LCPD)), into a single legislative instrument to improve the permitting, 
compliance and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States. 
The IPPC Directive laid down measures to prevent or, where that is not practicable, 
to reduce emissions in the air, water and land introducing ELVs and BAT. The LCPD 
prescribed ELVs for NOx, SO2 and PM10. 
The EID makes provisions for the continuation of the requirements and principles of 
the IPPC Directive and the LCPD and introduces new, more stringent, ELVs with full 
compliance required by 1st January 2016. 
The LCPD and IPPC Directives are implemented in England and Wales by the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 (the EP 
Regulations). 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
The Environment Agency will control and regulate the Generating Equipment with 
respect to the emissions to air from the stacks via an Environmental Permit that will 
be required for the Generating Equipment. The Environmental Permit will include 
specific ELVs to apply to the Generating Equipment for the relevant pollutants 
considered within the IED. Such limits will be based on the associated emissions 
levels (AEL) of recognised BAT as per current EA guidance notes and the existing 
EU IPPC ‘Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for Large Combustion 
Plant’ (2006) and the draft update of this document, ‘Best Available Techniques 
Reference Documents for the Large Combustion Plants’ (2013) (together, “BREF 
Notes”). 
The Habitats Directive 
The European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) sets out the legal framework requiring 
EU member states to protect habitat sites supporting vulnerable and protected 
species, as listed within the Directive. This Directive is transposed into UK law by the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) and requires 
protection of ecological sites including Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and 
Special Protection Areas (SPAs). 
Across the UK, site-specific critical levels (which relate to airborne pollutant 
concentrations at ground level) and critical loads (which relate to deposition of 
materials to soils) have been set for a variety of protected habitats and species in 
order to allow the quantitative assessment of the condition of ecologically sensitive 
sites and thus the protection of such sites by the relevant competent authorities. 
The Ambient Air Quality Directive 
The Ambient Air Quality Directive sets ambient air quality guidelines for NOx for the 
protection of ecosystems.  This imposes a long-term (annual average) limit for NOx 
of 30 µg/m3 (critical level). In terms of the limit for the protection of ecosystems, it is 
important to define the areas in which the limit is to be achieved. Directive 
2008/50/EC states that sampling points to determine concentrations should be: 
• 
20 km from an agglomeration (which is defined as an area with a population of 
more than 250 000); or 
• 
At least 5 km from other built-up areas, industrial installations or motorways or 
major roads with traffic counts of more than 50 000 vehicles per day; 
• 
Representative  of  air  quality  in  a  surrounding  area  of  at  least 1,000 km2. 
This is mirrored in the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010. 
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 
Improved provisions for the protection and management of SSSIs (in England and 
Wales) were introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act 2000. If 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
a development is “likely to damage” a SSSI, the CROW act requires that a relevant 
conservation body (i.e. Natural England) is consulted. The CROW act also provides 
protection to local nature conservation sites, which can be particularly important in 
providing ‘stepping stones’ or ‘buffers’ to SSSIs and European sites. In addition, the 
Environment Act (1995) and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(2006) both require the conservation of biodiversity. 
National Policy Statements 
NPS EN-1 explains the generic air emissions impacts with regard to energy 
infrastructure. Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) provide specific 
considerations potentially relevant to the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
respectively. 
Other National and Local Policy 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other national and 
local planning policy may be considered important and relevant by the SoS in the 
determination of an energy NSIP. 
The NPPF states (paragraph 7) that the planning system should perform a number of 
roles in delivering sustainable development including an environmental role 
“contributing to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; 
and, as part of this, helping to improve biodiversity, use natural resources prudently, 
minimise waste and pollution, and mitigate and adapt to climate change including 
moving to a low carbon economy.” 
The Bedford Borough Council Core and Rural Issues Plan (2021)1 aims to promote 
and guide sustainability practices at the borough. 
The “Policy CP26 Climate Change and Pollution” states that:  
“The Council will require development to:  
 
• 
Minimise the emissions of pollutants into the wider environment; and 
• 
Have regard to cumulative impacts of development proposals on air quality, in 
particular to relation to air quality management areas.” 
The Bedford Borough Council Air Quality Action Plan 20072 (amended as of July 
2008) sets out the actions that the Council is taking and intending to take to improve 
the air quality in the borough. This Action plan builds upon previous polices namely 
the Corporate Plan, the Community Plan and the Local Development Framework. 
The measures include improvement to the road network and traffic management;

reduce road congestion, especially in areas near declared AQMAs and reducing 
emissions from non-transport related sources, among others.  
The Development Strategy for Central Bedfordshire 20143 builds upon The Local 
Plan adopted in 2004. It establishes the policy framework for new developments in 
the District. 
The “Policy 44 Protection from the Environmental Pollution” stipulates that: 
“Development proposals which are likely to cause, pollution or are likely to be 
exposed to potential unacceptable levels of pollution or land instability sources of 
pollution will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that measures can be 
implemented to minimise impacts to a satisfactory level which protects health, 
environmental quality and amenity”

2.7 – Noise and Vibration 
NPS EN-1 ‘Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy’ 
Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1 sets out the requirements for assessing and mitigating 
noise and vibration from NSIPs in the energy sector. It also sets out the approach the 
SoS should adopt when considering noise assessments. 
It advises that operational noise from the a development and the proximity to noise 
sensitive premises, quiet areas or sites designated for ecological reasons are likely to 
determine the impact of noise. 
Where noise impacts are likely, a noise assessment should be undertaken in line 
with details listed in the NPS.   
Noise and vibration should be assessed using relevant British Standards (e.g. BS 
4142, BS 6472, BS 8233 and BS 5228) and other guidance, including the other 
NPS’s. 
NPS EN-1 advises the IPC that the project should: 
“Demonstrate good design through selection of the quietest cost-effective plant 
available; containment of noise within buildings wherever possible; optimisation of 
plant layout to minimise noise emissions; and, where possible, the use of 
landscaping, bunds or noise barriers to reduce noise transmission.” 
The proposal should meet the following aims before the IPC grants consent: 
“Avoid significant impacts on health and quality of life from noise, 
Mitigate and minimise other adverse impacts on health and quality of life from noise, 
Where possible, contribute to improvements to health and quality of life through the 
effective management and control of noise.” 
NPS EN-5 ‘National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure’ 
NPS EN-5 advises that high voltage transmission lines generate noise when the 
conductor surface electrical stress exceeded the inception level for corona discharge 
activity. This can be caused when surface contamination on a conductor or 
accidental damage occurs during transport or installation.  
It goes on to advise that highest noise levels are generated by a line during rain but 
that contamination may accumulate after a prolonged spell of dry weather. Surface 
grease can also cause noticeable noise if substandard grease is used during 
manufacture or the conducted has been overheated by carrying excessive electric 
load. 
Substation equipment such as transformers, quadrature boosters, mechanically 
switched capacitors and discharges on overhead line fittings such as spacers, 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
insulators and clamps can also cause audible noise. Whether the noise can be heard 
outside of the substation depends on, for example, transformer type and level of 
noise attenuation present.  
NPS EN-5 advises that British Standards (e.g. BS 4142) is suitable for assessment of 
dry weather conditions but not during rain. It therefore advises use of “an alternative 
noise assessment method such as the one developed by National Grid as described 
in report TR(T)94,1993”. 
National Planning Policy Framework, 2012 
In respect of noise the NPPF states that: 
“The planning system should contribute to and enhance the natural and local 
environment by… preventing both new and existing development from contributing to 
or being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by unacceptable 
levels of… noise pollution”. 
� 
It sets out four aims for planning polices and decisions: 
� 
“Avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and 
quality of life as a result of new development, 
� 
Mitigate and reduce to a minimum other adverse impacts on health and quality 
of life arising from noise from new development, including through the use of 
conditions, 
� 
Recognise that development will often create some noise and existing 
businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their business should not have 
unreasonable restrictions put on them because of changes in nearby land uses 
since they were established, 
� 
Identify and protect areas of tranquillity which have remained relatively 
undisturbed by noise and are prized for their recreational and amenity value for 
this reason.” 
The NPPF sets out a maximum noise level for mineral extraction of 55 dB LAeq,1h.  
During consultation the Public Protection Officer at CBC advised that this noise level 
is used as a construction noise limit. However, as the construction work is short term 
in nature an alternative limit has been proposed based on guidance within BS 5228-
1. 
Noise Policy Statement for England, 2010 
NPSE seeks to clarify the underlying principles and aims in existing policy 
documents, legislation and guidance that relate to noise. It also sets out the long 
term vision of Government noise policy: “to promote good health and a good quality 
of life through the effective management of noise within the context of Government 
policy on sustainable development”. 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
The NPSE clarifies that noise should not be considered in isolation of the wider 
benefits of a scheme or development, and that the intention is to minimise noise and 
noise effects as far as is reasonably practicable having regard to the underlying 
principles of sustainable development. 
It sets out three aims, which can be summarised as: 
� 
“Avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
environmental, neighbour and neighbourhood noise within the context of 
Government policy on sustainable development, 
� 
Mitigate and minimise adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
environmental, neighbour and neighbourhood noise within the context of 
Government policy on sustainable development, 
� 
Where possible, contribute to the improvement of health and quality of life 
through the effective management and control of environmental, neighbour and 
neighbourhood noise within the context of Government policy on sustainable 
development.” 
Planning Practice Guidance, 2014 
The PPG “provides answers to a number of questions and reiterates the guidance 
within the NPPF and NPSE”. It states that “noise needs to be considered when new 
developments may create additional noise and when new developments would be 
sensitive to the prevailing acoustic environment”. 
It provides advice regarding how to determine the impact of noise, including whether 
or not a significant adverse effect or adverse effect “is occurring or likely to occur” 
and whether or not a “good standard of amenity can be achieved”. 
The PPG also provides guidance regarding what factors influence whether noise 
could be a concern, including: 
� 
Source and absolute level of the noise; 
� 
Time of day, 
� 
Number and pattern of noise events (for non-continuous sound), 
� 
Frequency content of the noise, 
� 
General character (“i.e. whether or not the noise contains particular tonal 
characteristics or other particular features”), and 
� 
Local topology and topography. 
Additionally, “when relevant”, the cumulative impact of multiple sources along with 
the extent to which the noise source is intermittent and of limited duration. 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
The PPG also provides advice on how the adverse effects of noise can be mitigated 
which are broadly in line with measures outlined in NPS EN-1. 
Relevant British Standards and Guidance 
A variety of different standards have been considered for the noise assessment of 
the Project. These standards relate to the methodology used for noise monitoring 
and data collection, noise and vibration assessment for operational impacts and 
noise and vibration assessment for construction impacts. 
It is necessary to consider a range of standards given the nature of the Project (e.g. 
potential to generate noise and vibration from a range of sources and impact on a 
range of receptors during construction, decommissioning and operation). 
BS 4142:1997 Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential and 
industrial areas, 1997 
BS 4142 sets out a method for determining the level of noise of an industrial nature, 
together with procedures for assessing whether the noise is likely to give rise to 
complaints from people living nearby. 
A revision to BS 4142:1997 is currently in progress. However, the method in the 
current standard subtracts the background level (LA90,T) from the ‘rating level’, 
(LAr,Tr) which is calculated by adjusting the noise source (with a 5 dB penalty) for a 
character correction where the noise: 
� 
Contains a distinguishable, discrete, continuous note, 
� 
Contains distinct impulses, 
� 
Is irregular enough to attract attention. 
BS 5228-1:2009+A1:2014 Code of practice for noise and vibration control on 
construction and open sites Part 1 Noise, 2014 
BS 5228-1 provides recommendations for the prediction and control of noise from 
construction and other open sites where construction activities are carried out. 
BS 5228-2:2009+A1:2014 Code of practice for noise and vibration control on 
construction and open sites Part 2 Vibration, 2014 
BS 5228-2 provides advice on the human response to construction vibration.  Table 
A2.1 provides the BS 5228-2 guidance.

2.9 – Water Quality and Resources 
National Policy Statements 
In relation to hydrological considerations of Energy NSIPs, NPS EN-1 requires that: 
� 
Where the Project is likely to have effects on the water environment, the 
applicant should undertake an assessment of the existing status of, and impacts 
of the development on, water quality, water resources and physical 
characteristics of the water environment; 
� 
An application should be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) for 
energy projects of 1ha or greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in 
Flood Zone 2 and 3; 
� 
Pre-application discussions are undertaken with the Environment Agency and 
other bodies; 
� 
Any requirements for sequential testing are satisfied; 
� 
Priority is given to the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). 
The NPPF and the accompanying Planning Practice Guidance sets out the 
Government’s national policy on development and flood risk and seeks to provide 
clarity on what is required at regional and local levels to ensure that flood risk is 
taken into account at all stages in the planning process, to avoid inappropriate 
development in areas at risk of flooding and to direct development away from areas 
at highest risk.  The NPPF outlines a risk based approach to the planning process 
and requires that the Sequential Test is used to guide the decision making process 
by steering development to areas with the lowest probability of flooding where 
feasible. 
The NPPF requires that the spatial planning process should consider the possible 
impacts of climate change and contingency allowances are provided to enable 
impacts to be considered over the lifetime of the development. 
The Water Resources Act 
The Water Resources Act 1991 (WRA) came into effect in 1991 and replaced the 
corresponding sections of the Water Act 1989. 
The WRA sets out the responsibilities of the Environment Agency in relation to water 
pollution, resource management, flood defence, fisheries and, in some areas, 
navigation. The WRA regulates discharges to controlled waters, namely rivers, 
estuaries, coastal waters, lakes and groundwater. Discharge to controlled waters is 
only permitted with the consent of the Environment Agency. Similarly, a licence is 
required to abstract from controlled waters.

Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) 
Regulations (DEFRA, 2003) 
These regulations transpose the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) into national 
law.  The Directive is a wide-ranging piece of European legislation that establishes a 
new legal framework for the protection, improvement and sustainable use of surface 
waters, coastal waters and groundwater across Europe in order to: 
� 
Promote sustainable water use; 
� 
Contribute to the mitigation of floods and droughts; 
� 
Prevent deterioration and enhance status of aquatic ecosystems, including 
groundwater; 
� 
Reduce pollution. 
Water management has historically been co-ordinated according to administrative or 
political boundaries. The WFD promotes a new approach based upon management 
by river basin - the natural geographical and hydrological unit. River basin 
management plans include clear objectives in respect of water quality and pollution 
control and a detailed account of how objectives are to be met within a prescribed 
timeframe. 
Land Drainage Act 1991 
The Act consolidates various enactments relating to Internal Drainage Boards and 
the functions of these Boards and local authorities in relation to land drainage.  
Amongst other matters, the Act sets out provisions and powers in respect of the 
control of flow of watercourses and watercourse restoration/improvement work. 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
The Regulations as amended provide the regulatory framework under which 
discharges to controlled water and other emissions to the environment are controlled. 
The Surface Waters Plan - Plan for Strategic Management of Surface Waters 
and their Local Environment in the Forest of Marston Vale (Bedfordshire and 
River Ivel Internal Drainage Board and the Forest of Marston Vale, June 2002) 
This document was prepared to promote a series of policies that will encourage an 
integrated and sustainable approach to the management of surface waters in the 
context of major development in the area, including 
� 
An integrated approach to flood risk management, surface water drainage and 
the water environment; 
� 
Promote government guidance such as PPS25, providing a framework for the 
site specific Flood Risk Assessments to be produced in support of planning 
applications;

that are sustainable and offer opportunities for environmental and recreational 
gains. 
It should be noted that Rookery Pit lies outside of the Bedfordshire and River Ivel 
Internal Drainage Board’s area of jurisdiction. However, Mill Brook, which flows along 
the western side of the Pit, outfalls to Stewartby Lake located just to the west, which 
is a water body maintained by the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage 
Board.

2.10 – Ground Conditions 
Legislation - Soils 
The protection and conservation of the soil and groundwater environment is covered 
within a variety of legislative and policy frameworks.  
UK legislation on contaminated land is principally contained in Part 2A of the 
Environmental Protection Act, 1990, as amended by the Environment Act 1995. The 
Statutory Guidance that accompanies the Act has recently been revised and was 
issued by DEFRA in April 2012 (Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
Environmental Protection Act 1990: Part 2A Contaminated Land Statutory Guidance). 
Contaminated Land for the purpose of Part 2A is defined as: “…any land which 
appears to the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in such condition, by 
reason of substances in, on or under land that: (i) Significant harm is being caused or 
there is significant possibility of such harm being caused; or (ii) Pollution of controlled 
waters is being, or is likely to be, caused.” 
The principle of risk assessment underlies the determination of whether these 
definitions apply in the identification of contaminated land.  Risk assessment is 
carried out via ‘source-pathway-receptor’ principles to evaluate the potential for 
pollutant linkages and to identify unacceptable risk. The application of risk 
assessment techniques to the management of contaminated land is set out in the 
technical framework presented in the Environment Agency Model Procedures for the 
Management of Contaminated Land (CLR11).  
Following the review of the contaminated land regime including public consultation, 
revised Statutory Guidance was issued and the Contaminated Land (England) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/263) and the Contaminated Land Statutory 
Guidance for England 2012 came into force on 6th April 2012. This revised Statutory 
Guidance while still taking a precautionary approach allows regulators to make 
quicker decisions about whether or not land is contaminated under Part 2A 
preventing 
costly 
remediation

being 
undertaken 
unnecessarily. It also offers better protection against potential health impacts by 
concentrating on the sites where action is actually needed. 
Legislation - Groundwater 
The 1980 Groundwater Directive 80/68/EEC and the 2006 Groundwater Daughter 
Directive 2006/118/EC of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) are the 
main  European legislation in place to protect groundwater. The Water Framework 
Directive (WFD) (2000) aims to protect and enhance the quality of surface 
freshwater, groundwaters and dependent eco systems, estuaries and coastal waters.  
Controlled waters are also protected by Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990.

The Environment Agency has a remit to prevent or reduce the risk of water pollution, 
wherever possible, and to ensure that it gets cleaned up if pollution occurs that might 
lead to effects on ecosystems or people.  A regulatory regime supporting this policy 
has been introduced by the Water Resources Act 1991 (as modified by the 
Environment Act 1995), and the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010.  
National Planning Policy Framework  
The NPPF sets out to prevent both new and existing development from contributing 
to or being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by 
unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability; and  
remediating and mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable 
land, where appropriate. It also requires that unacceptable risks from pollution and 
land instability, planning policies and decisions should ensure that new development 
is appropriate for its location. 
For planning purposes, the NPPF requires that the assessment of risks arising from 
contamination and remediation requirements should be considered on the basis of 
the current environmental setting, the current land use, and the circumstances of its 
proposed new use.    
National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) was introduced on the 6th March 2014 
by the DCLG in relation to “Land affected by contamination” and “Water supply, 
wastewater and water quality”. The guidance sets out both the statutory regime and 
phased approach that should be adopted in the determination and assessment of 
risk.  
National Planning Practice Guidance was also introduced on the 6th March 2014 by 
the DCLG in relation to “Land Stability”. The guidance sets out both the statutory 
regime and phased approach that should be adopted in the determination and 
assessment of risk. 
Local Policy 
Reference has also been made to regional and local planning policies, including the 
following: 
� 
Bedfordshire Minerals and Waste Local Plan policies GE1 and GE20 require 
applications to provide details regarding impact on water resources and its 
quality.   
� 
Central Bedfordshire’s Local Development Framework draft Design Guide – 
Requires developers to carry out contaminated land surveys in order to 
demonstrate how any existing contamination can be mitigated (if present).   
� 
Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) Core Strategy policy CS13: Climate 
Change considers measures to take account of climate change, such as; 
contributions to waste minimisation; and, provisions to limit any adverse effects 
on water quality.  Policy CS18: Biodiversity and Geological Conservation, 
supports the designation, management, and protection of geology.  
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report

� 
CBC Core Strategy policy DM3: High Quality Development, requires all 
proposals for new development to comply with the current guidance on waste 
management, water and airborne pollution. 
� 
Bedford Borough Council (BBC) Core Strategy policy CP21: Designing in 
Quality, requires new development to mitigate against the effects of any 
pollution including from water and land contamination. 
� 
BBC Core Strategy policy CP26: Climate Change and Pollution, requires that 
any potentially polluting developments and the location of sensitive 
developments in proximity to existing sources of pollution are material planning 
considerations.  This position is supported in the Borough’s Climate Change 
and Pollution SPD.   
Guidance 
There are numerous technical guidance documents on the assessment and 
management of contamination including Contaminated Land Report CLR 11 (EA 
2004).  
A summary of the guidance relating to the protection of groundwater resources is 
presented in the publication by the Environment Agency (EA) entitled ‘Groundwater 
Protection: Principles and Practice (GP3)’ (EA, 2012).

2.11 – LVIA 
NPS 
National policy seeks to protect and enhance environmental quality specifically for 
new energy infrastructure through NPS EN-1. It recognises that nationally significant 
infrastructure projects will have effects on the landscape and that the scale of such 
projects means they may be visible within many miles of the site of the proposed 
infrastructure. 
Section 5.9 of NPS EN-1 requires, “The applicant’s assessment should include the 
effects during construction of the project and the effects of the completed 
development and its operation on landscape components and character. The 
assessment should include the visibility and conspicuousness of the project during 
construction and of the presence and operation of the project and potential impacts 
on views and visual amenity. This should include light pollution effects, including on 
local amenity, and nature conservation”. 
With regard to landscape impacts, NPS EN-1 states, “Landscape effects depend on 
the existing character of the local landscape, its current quality, how highly it is 
valued and its capacity to accommodate change. All of these factors need to be 
considered in judging the impact of a project on landscape. Virtually all nationally 
significant infrastructure projects will have effects on landscape. Projects need to be 
designed carefully, taking account of the potential impact on the landscape. Having 
regard to siting, operational and other relevant constraints the aim should be to 
minimise harm to the landscape, providing reasonable mitigation where possible and 
appropriate.” 
With reference to visual impact NPS EN-1 states, “All proposed energy infrastructure 
is likely to have visual effects for many receptors around proposed sites. The 
[Secretary of State] will have to judge whether the visual effects on sensitive 
receptors ….. outweigh the benefits of the project. The [Secretary of State] should 
ensure applicants have taken into account the landscape and visual impacts of 
visible plumes from chimney stacks and / or cooling assembly”. 
NPPF 
Twelve core planning principles are set out in paragraph 17 of the NPPF, and those 
of relevance to LVIA include: 
� 
“Take account of the different roles and character of different areas, promoting 
the vitality of our main urban areas, protecting the Green Belts around them, 
recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside and supporting 
thriving rural communities within it”; and 
� 
“Conserve heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their significance, so that 
they can be enjoyed for their contribution to the quality of life of this and future 
generations...”.

Regional and Local Policy 
The Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management Policy, 
adopted November 2009 (Central Bedfordshire Council, 2009), is the key policy 
document, providing the framework against which to assess planning applications in 
the area.  It provides objectives, spatial strategy and development management 
policies for the period 2001 – 2026, those relevant to landscape and visual issues 
are:  
� 
Policy CS14: High Quality Development; 
� 
Policy CS15: Heritage; 
� 
Policy CS16: Landscape and Woodland; and 
� 
Development Management Policy DM14: Landscape and Woodland. 
The Central Bedfordshire Development Strategy, pre-submission draft 2014 (Central 
Bedfordshire Council, 2014a), is currently being developed.  Policy relevant to 
landscape and visual issues is:  
� 
Policy 58: Landscape. 
The Forest of Marston Vale: Forest Plan (The Forest of Marston Vale, 2000).  The 
Forest of Marston Vale is one of 12 Community Forests within England.  The Forest 
Plan is a non-statutory document which sets out proposals for developing the forest 
over a 30 year period.  It includes a landscape assessment, and identifies four 
landscape zones, with specific proposals.

2.12 – Traffic and Transport 
National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
Section 5.13 of NPS EN-1 sets out the transport-related assessment requirements 
for NSIPs, including: 
� 
The need to submit a transport assessment where a project is likely to have 
significant transport implications; 
� 
The need to prepare a travel plan, where appropriate; and 
� 
The need to provide details of proposed measures to improve access by public 
transport, walking and cycling, to reduce the need for parking and to mitigate 
transport impacts. 
This section of NPS – EN-1 also states that, subject to appropriate mitigation being 
provided for transport impacts identified in accordance with the relevant DfT 
guidance, “… then development consent should not be withheld, and appropriately 
limited weight should be applied to residual effects on the surrounding transport 
infrastructure.” 
In addition, it states that, where mitigation is needed, possible demand management 
measures must be considered before new transport infrastructure, but that the IPC 
should have regard to the cost effectiveness of demand management measures as 
well as the aim to secure more sustainable patterns of transport development when 
considering mitigation measures. 
Local Transport Plans   
The Local Transport Plan (LTP) establishes a strategic approach through which to 
deal with key transport issues, objectives, and interventions. Two Local Transport 
Plans are relevant to the Proposed Development: Central Bedfordshire Council and 
Bedford Borough Council.  
Central Bedfordshire Council’s LTP3 considers the period between April 2011 and 
March 2026. In Section 6, the LTP identifies a series of objectives, including: 
� 
Increasing the ease of access to employment by sustainable modes; 
� 
Reducing the impact of commuting trips on local communities; and 
� 
Minimising the negative impacts of freight trips on local communities. 
Bedford Borough Council’s LTP3 is published as a series of supporting strategy 
documents, and considers the period between April 2011 and March 2021. It 
identifies a series of actions and objectives, including: 
� 
Increasing the number of trips undertaken by active travel modes for all 
purposes; and 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report

� 
Ensuring that freight delivery routing, controls and infrastructure are considered 
as an integral part of planning proposals for Bedford Borough. 
Guidance for Transport Assessment 
The Department for Transport published 'Guidance on Transport Assessment' in 
March 2007 to provide guidance on determining when an assessment is required, its 
content and the stages in the preparation of transport assessments and statements.  
All current policy emphasises the value of early discussions in relation to transport 
assessments. This ensures that all parties have a better understanding of, and reach 
a consensus on, the key issues to be addressed in respect of a particular 
development proposal. The issues agreed in such pre-application discussions should 
indicate the level and scope of assessment that will be required.  
The key issues to be addressed during any pre-application consultations include the 
following: 
� 
planning policy context of development proposal; 
� 
catchments or study area for the proposed development; 
� 
assessment years – year of opening and horizon year(s); 
� 
assessment of public transport capacity, walking/cycling capacity and the road 
network capacity; 
� 
person trip generation and trip distribution methodologies and/or assumptions; 
� 
measures to promote sustainable travel; and 
� 
mitigation measures (where applicable) – scope and implementation strategy. 
Circular 02/13 - ‘The Strategic Road Network and the Delivery of Sustainable 
Development - 2007’ 
Circular 02/2013 sets out the role of the Highways Agency in engaging with 
communities and developers to deliver sustainable development and economic 
growth. 
Paragraph 9 sets out the broad policy aims of the circular as it relates to 
development proposals, stating that: 
“Development proposals are likely to be acceptable if they can be accommodated 
within the existing capacity of a section (link or junction)…or they do not increase 
demand for use of a section that is already operating at over-capacity levels, taking 
account of any travel plan, traffic management and/or capacity enhancement 
measures that may be agreed”.

However, with reference to decision making regarding developments, paragraph 9 
goes on to state: 
“However, development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds 
where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe”.

2.13 – Archaeology and Cultural Heritage 
Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 
Scheduled Monuments are designated by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media 
and Sport on the advice of English Heritage as selective examples of nationally 
important archaeological remains.  Under the terms of Part I Section 2 of the Ancient 
Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 (the “1979 Act”), it is an offence to 
demolish, destroy, damage, remove, repair, flood or tip on a Scheduled Monument 
either above or below ground without first obtaining permission (Scheduled 
Monument Consent) from the Secretary of State.  This Act does not allow for the 
protection of the setting of Scheduled Monuments. 
Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 
When considering whether to grant planning permission for development which 
affects a listed building or its setting, Section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and 
Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (the “1990 Act”) places a statutory duty on a local 
planning authority [LPA] or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State to “have 
special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any 
features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses” (para. 66(1).   
Section 72 of the 1990 Act places a general duty on planning authorities in the 
exercise of planning functions with respect to any buildings or other land in a 
conservation area, stating that “special attention shall be paid to the desirability of 
preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of that area” (para. 72 (1). 
There is no specific reference to the setting of Conservation Areas in the 1990 Act.   
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 
Under Section 38 (6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (the “2004 
Act”), “If regard is to be had to the development plan for the purpose of any 
determination to be made under the planning Acts the determination must be made 
in accordance with the plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise” (para. 
36 (6)). 
Relevant Planning Policy for cultural heritage is presented in the National Policy 
Statement for Energy [NPS EN-1]. It is also contained within the National Planning 
Policy Framework [NPPF] and the associated Planning Practice Guidance [PPG]. 
Policies relevant to the proposed development are also presented in the adopted 
Development Plans for the host authorities and other Local Development Framework 
Documents [LDF’s].

2.14 – Socio-economics 
National Policy Statements 
NPS EN-1 acknowledges “the construction, operation and decommissioning of 
energy infrastructure may have socio-economic impacts at local and regional levels”. 
At paragraph 4.2.2 it states that in addition to an ES prepared in accordance with the 
European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive “the IPC will find it helpful if 
the applicant sets out information on the likely significant social and economic effects 
of the development, and show how any likely significant negative effects would be 
avoided or mitigated. This could include employment, equality, community cohesion 
and well-being.” 
Paragraph 5.12.3 states that where the project is likely to have socio-economic 
impacts at local or regional levels, the applicant should undertake and include in their 
application an assessment of relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: 
creation of jobs and training opportunities; provision of additional local services and 
improvements to local infrastructure including provision of educational and visitor 
facilities; effects on tourism; and the impacts of a changing influx of workers during 
different phases. 
Paragraph 5.12.7 further notes that in making a decision on energy NSIPs the SoS 
may attribute limited weight to assertions of socio-economic impact that are not 
supported by evidence and may take into account mitigation such as planning 
obligations and particular options as to phasing the development in relation to 
impacts.   
NPS EN-2, Paragraph 1.72 details the benefits of a low carbon economy including 
the likely “positive effects on the Economy and Skills, and Health and Well-being as 
secondary benefits and positive effects in the medium/long term on climate change.” 
While only a number of the impacts raised in the NPSs are considered likely to be 
relevant to the Project, the socio-economic assessment may also consider any 
relevant positive provisions the developer has made or is proposing to make to 
mitigate impacts (for example through planning obligations) and any legacy benefits 
that may arise as well as any options for phasing development in relation to the 
Socio-Economic Impacts, to enable them to be considered by the SoS for the 
purposes of decision-making. 
Other National and Local Policy 
While the Planning Act 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policies can be considered important and relevant by the 
SoS in the determination of an energy NSIP. 
The NPPF has sustainable development at its core, stating that the policies in 
paragraphs 18-219 taken as a whole constitute the Government’s view of what 
sustainable development in England means in practice for the planning system. It 
recognises that sustainable development has three dimensions: economic, social 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
and environmental, and these dimensions are reflected in the 12 ‘Core planning 
principles’. Those of relevance to socio-economic impact assessment are: 
� 
Proactively drive and support sustainable economic development to deliver the 
homes, business and industrial units, infrastructure and thriving local places that 
the country needs. Every effort should be made objectively to identify and then 
meet the housing, business and other development needs of an area, and 
respond positively to wider opportunities for growth. Plans should take account 
of market signals, such as land prices and housing affordability, and set out a 
clear strategy for allocating sufficient land which is suitable for development in 
their area, taking account of the needs of the residential and business 
communities; and 
� 
Take account of and support local strategies to improve health, social and 
cultural wellbeing for all, and deliver sufficient community and cultural facilities 
and services to meet local needs. 
These underpin the 13 ways of ‘delivering sustainable development’, the most 
relevant to this Socio-Economic Impact assessment being listed below: 
� 
Building a strong, competitive economy (1); 
� 
Supporting a prosperous rural economy (3); and 
� 
Promoting healthy communities (8). 
In relation to (1) it is stated that “the Government is committed to ensuring that the 
planning system does everything it can to support sustainable economic growth. 
Planning should operate to encourage and not act as an impediment to sustainable 
growth. Therefore significant weight should be placed on the need to support 
economic growth through the planning system” (paragraph 19). Paragraph 21 further 
states that “investment in business should not be over-burdened by the combined 
requirements of planning policy expectations. [Local] Planning policies should 
recognise and seek to address potential barriers to investment, including a poor 
environment or any lack of infrastructure, services or housing”.  
In relation to (3) paragraph 28 states that “planning policies should support economic 
growth in rural areas in order to create jobs and prosperity by taking a positive 
approach to sustainable new development. To promote a strong rural economy, local 
and neighbourhood plans should support the sustainable growth and expansion of all 
types of business and enterprise in rural areas (…)”.  
In Promoting Healthy Communities (8), paragraphs 69 and 70 note that (local) 
planning policies and decisions should develop a shared vision with communities of 
the environment and facilities they wish to see, and take an integrated approach to 
the location of economic uses of land.  
HM Government’s 2012 Gas Generation Strategy, prepared by the Department of 
Energy & Climate Change (DECC), highlights that gas-fired power stations are 
Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
Technical Appendices 
 
 
 
relatively cost effective and quick to build.  It states that these plants can “offer 
employment opportunities throughout the country”. 
HM Government’s UK Low Carbon Transition Plan: National Strategy for Climate and 
Energy,  also prepared by DECC states, “Coal and gas will remain important to 
ensure our electricity supply is reliable and secure as we move towards greater 
dependence on intermittent renewable sources like wind”. 
The Central Bedfordshire Economic Development Plan (November 2011) outlines 
CBC’s plan to reach its full economic potential. Central Bedfordshire aims to create 
27,000 new jobs by 2026. This will be achieved by “attracting new industries and 
businesses to the area in addition to new jobs created by population growth” (p4). It 
states, “Central Bedfordshire is to be recognised as a place truly open for business” 
(p4). 
The Central Bedfordshire Economic Development plan “focuses on creating the right 
conditions to attract, retain and grow business to provide more employment 
opportunities and support our residents to access and benefit from such 
opportunities” (p5). 
The Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management Policies 
(Adopted November 2009) provides a long term vision for development in the area 
up to 2026. The Project Site is located in the North Marston Vale Strategic Area 
which is allocated for significant housing, employment and regeneration uses. One of 
the main challenges identified in this document is the provision of jobs and the 
strategy outlines the aim to provide additional jobs for the increasing population.  
Bedford Growth Plan (2014) – Stimulating Economic Growth provides a framework 
for promoting economic development. This document proposes that a new growth 
plan is required to allow faster delivery of jobs growth. Two aims which are of 
relevance to this Project are to “bring forward employment sites faster” and 
“regenerate older industrial estates” (p12). One of the main aims is to attract private 
sector investment to the area.  
Shaping Bedford Borough’s Economy (2011-2014) sets out the vision for Bedford to 
be “A Thriving Borough with a stronger local economy delivering higher levels of 
sustainable growth and employment for the benefit of the Borough’s existing and 
future residents”. 
The strategy seeks a change in direction towards private sector led employment 
growth.  Priority 2 is “directed to support private sector business growth to offset the 
decline in the public sector and deliver the required overall future growth in 
employment”. There is a need to attract higher paid jobs to the area.

Appendix 7. 
Noise and Vibration 
7.1 – Acoustics Terminology  
The acoustic terms used in this report are as follows: 
 
dB           :      Decibel - Used as a measurement of sound pressure level. It is the 
logarithmic ratio of the noise being assessed to a standard 
reference level. 
 
dBA        :    The human ear is more susceptible to mid-frequency noise than the 
high and low frequencies.  To take account of this when measuring 
noise, the 'A' weighting scale is used so that the measured noise 
corresponds roughly to the overall level of noise that is discerned by 
the average human.  It is also possible to calculate the 'A' weighted 
noise level by applying certain corrections to an un-weighted 
spectrum.  The measured or calculated 'A' weighted noise level is 
known as the dBA level. 
 
                      Because of being a logarithmic scale noise levels in dBA do not 
have a linear relationship to each other.  For similar noises, a 
change in noise level of 10dBA represents a doubling or halving of 
subjective loudness.  A change of 3dBA is just perceptible. 
 
L10 & L90:     If a non-steady noise is to be described it is necessary to know both 
its level and the degree of fluctuation.  The Ln indices are used for 
this purpose, and the term refers to the level exceeded for n% of 
the time, hence L10 is the level exceeded for 10% of the time and as 
such can be regarded as the 'average maximum level'.  Similarly, 
L90 is the average minimum level and is often used to describe the 
background noise. 
 
                      It is common practice to use the L10 index to describe traffic noise, 
as being a high average, it takes into account the increased 
annoyance that results from the non-steady nature of traffic noise. 
 
Leq           :   The concept of Leq (equivalent continuous sound level) has up to 
recently been primarily used in assessing noise in industry but 
seems now to be finding use in defining many other types of noise, 
such as aircraft noise, environmental noise and construction noise. 
 
                    Leq is defined as a notional steady sound level which, over a stated 
period of time, would contain the same amount of acoustical energy 
as the actual, fluctuating sound measured over that period (e.g. 1 
hour). 
 
                    The use of digital technology in sound level meters now makes the 
measurement of Leq very straightforward.

Lmax        :    Lmax is the maximum sound pressure level recorded over the period 
stated. Lmax is sometimes used in assessing environmental noise 
where occasional loud noises occur, which may have little effect on 
the Leq noise level.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a Phase 1 Habitat Survey of the Project Site (the 
‘Survey Site’). The purpose of the survey was to inform and support an application for Development 
Consent for the Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature review was also 
conducted, which covered the Project Site and land up to 5km for statutory designated sites, and 2 
km for non-statutory designated sites from the Survey Site. 
1.3 
The desk study undertaken in support of this assessment identified the presence of seven 
nationally designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within a 5 km radius of the Survey 
Site. The closest of these is Cooper’s Hill SSSI located approximately 550 m to the south-east of 
the south-eastern corner of the Survey Site. This site is designated for its extensive heathland 
situated on acidic soil. In addition, there are six Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) within a 5 km radius 
of the Survey Site, four of which are also designated as SSSIs. The closest LNR, which is not also 
a SSSI is Flitwick Wood LNR located approximately 3.3 km to the south of the Survey Site. This 
site comprises an area of ancient woodland supporting a diverse botanical assemblage.  
1.4 
A total of 12 non-statutory designated CWSs are present within a 2 km radius of the Survey Site. 
The closest of these is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, which covers a proportion of the northern extremity 
of the Survey Site within the area also known as Rookery South Pit. The Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
consists of three large pools with associated reedbed, sparse ephemeral/short perennial vegetation 
and rank neutral grassland in the north-western corner. It is understood that habitats within 
Rookery South Pit (which occupies the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS) is currently the 
subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner.  Towards the end 
of 2014, the base of Rookery South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk 
movement of soils that are required for the LLRS.  . 
1.5 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey found the Survey Site to predominantly comprise intensively managed 
arable land. Other habitats present included plantation broadleaved and mixed woodland, scrub, 
neutral grassland, improved grassland, tall ruderal vegetation, ephemeral / short perennial 
vegetation, swamp, standing water (ponds), running water (ditches) and species-poor hedgerows. 
1.6 
There are several habitats across the Survey Site which may be considered to meet the criteria for 
being Habitats of Principal Importance (HPI) (s. 41; NERC Act 2006). These include all hedgerows 
within the Survey Site and the open mosaic habitats (on previously developed land) contained 
within the Rookery Clay Pit CWS.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
Area within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas which extend from 
The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre 
of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and 
Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site covers the red-line boundary of the Project Site as reported in the Project Scoping 
Report, as illustrated on Figure 2. The main habitats within the Survey Site are arable fields, 
delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the north, an area of land exists 
that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the 
landowner. This area presently includes sparsely vegetated ground, swamp and bare earth. 
Towards the end of 2014, the base of Rookery South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth 
following bulk movement of soils that are required for the LLRS.  . 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and initial Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified 
the need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation 
value of the Project Site, including an update of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, conducted at an 
appropriate time of year. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology 
chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an integral part of the 
application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey were to: 
 
Identify and characterise any statutory and non-statutory sites within 5 km and 2 km radii from 
the Survey Site boundary, respectively. 
 
Identify whether any Habitats of Principal Importance (S. 41; NERC Act 2006) are present 
within the Survey Site, and if present, to describe their condition and coverage. 
2.7 
This report updates the preliminary Ecological Appraisal for the Survey Site (BSG Ecology, 2014) 
with the main focus being on the identification and characterisation of designated sites and 
description of habitats within the Survey Site. Recommendations for protected and otherwise 
notable species of animal were made in the preliminary Ecological Appraisal. Accordingly, separate 
(Phase 2) surveys have been completed, and reports produced for mammals, herpetofauna 
(reptiles and amphibians), breeding birds and invertebrates. These were conducted synchronous to 
the present Phase 1 Habitat Survey.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC). Information on 
statutory designated sites was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the 
Survey Site boundary, and information regarding non-statutory designated sites was requested 
covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary. 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
Habitats within the Survey Site were identified and described following standard Joint Nature 
Conservation Committee (JNCC) Phase 1 habitat survey methodology as detailed in the Phase 1 
Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). This uses a system of codes to describe different habitat 
types based on the dominant vegetation present, which are recorded through the preparation of 
habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this report follow The New Flora of British Isles 
(Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
An initial field survey to map and describe habitats was undertaken by Stephen Foot MCIEEM and 
Dr Jessica Frame MCIEEM on 25th February 2014, this was subsequently updated by Dr Jim 
Fairclough MCIEEM following several visits to the Survey Site in late spring and summer, the last 
of these visits being on 30 July 2014.  
3.4 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site. They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual. 
3.5 
During the survey the presence of any invasive species of plant (listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981, as amended) was recorded.  . 
Limitations to Methods 
3.6 
There are no limitations to the survey conducted. The initial survey was undertaken in February 
2014, which is outside the optimal period for Phase 1 Habitat Survey. However, the present survey 
was conducted across several survey visits during the optimal survey season (late spring and 
summer), providing confidence that any plants or habitats of conservation concern would have 
been identified.

Results and Interpretation 
Desk Study 
Statutory Designated Sites 
4.1 
There are seven nationally designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) located within 5 km 
of the Survey Site boundary. The closest of these is Cooper’s Hill SSSI located approximately 
550m to the south-east of the south-eastern corner of the Survey Site.  This site is designated for 
its extensive heathland situated on acidic soil. . 
4.2 
There are also six Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) within a 5 km radius of the Survey Site; four of 
which are also designated as SSSIs.  The closest LNR, which is not also a SSSI is Flitwick Wood 
LNR located approximately 3.3 km to the south of the Survey Site. This site comprises an area of 
ancient woodland supporting a diverse botanical assemblage.. 
4.3 
All statutory designated sites present within a 5 km radius of the Survey Site are outlined in Table 1 
in Appendix 2, and locations of these are shown on Figures 1a and 1b (Appendix 1), based on data 
provided by the BRMC. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites 
4.4 
A total of 17 non-statutory designated County Wildlife Sites (CWSs) (including Cooper’s Hill CWS 
which overlaps with Cooper’s Hill SSSI) are present within a 2 km radius of the Survey Site. The 
closest of these is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, which covers a proportion of the northern part of the 
Survey Site. The pit consists of three large pools (one of which is in the process of being drained) 
with associated reedbed (swamp), marshy grassland, scrub and unimproved neutral grassland. A 
patchy mosaic of sparse ephemeral/short perennial vegetation and bare ground is also present 
throughout the site. A broadleaved plantation is present forming a band through the centre of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
4.5 
Two Roadside Nature Reserves (RNRs) are also present within the study area. Marston Bypass 
RNR, and Cooper’s Hill RNR. The closest of these is Marston Bypass RNR, which is located 
approximately 0.7 km to the west of the Survey Site and consists of a road verge sown with 
wildflower seeds. 
4.6 
The remaining sites are described in Table 2 in Appendix 2 with their locations shown in Figure 1b 
(produced and provided by the BRMC). Where there is overlap of a non-designated site with a 
statutory designated site (see above), the description for the statutory designated site takes 
precedence. A single Local Geological Site (LGS), Quest Pit LGS, which is not of nature 
conservation importance, lies approximately 1 km north east of the Survey Site. 
Habitats  
4.7 
The majority of the Survey Site comprised intensively managed agricultural land, characterised by 
large arable fields, grass-covered field margins and fairly recent, species-poor, yet intact 
hedgerows (dominated by hawthorn Crataegus monogyna). Occasional wooded plantations of 
fairly recent origin (less than 30 years old) were located across the Survey Site. To the north of the 
Survey Site is land within the Rookery Clay Pits CWS. The parts of the Survey Site within the CWS 
included an access track that was a mosaic of bare ground with ephemeral vegetation and scrub at 
varying density; and a large depression (the southern pit) that comprised a patchy mosaic of bare 
ground, ephemeral vegetation and swamp vegetation in the form of drying reedbed dominated by 
stunted common reed Phragmites australis. 
4.8 
The following broad habitat types were recorded within the Survey Site during the survey: 
 
Arable; 
 
Plantation woodland; 
 
Scrub and tall ruderal vegetation;

 
Neutral grassland; 
 
Improved grassland; 
 
Ephemeral / short perennial vegetation; 
 
Swamp (reedbed) 
 
Standing water (ponds); 
 
Running water (wet ditches); and 
 
Species-poor hedgerows (some with standard trees). 
4.9 
The distribution of these habitats is shown on Figure 2 (Appendix 1) with summary descriptions 
given below. Dominant or characteristic flora is described, together with notes on the relative 
abundance of floral species within the context of each habitat parcel. Target Notes (TNs) referred 
to in the text below and on Figure 2 are provided in Appendix 3 with photographs provided in 
Appendix 4. 
Arable 
4.10 
The majority of the Survey Site comprised intensively managed arable farmland. Field margins 
were up to 4 m wide, but generally species poor and appeared to have been sown with grasses 
that permit infrequent vehicular access along the margins without ‘cutting up’ the ground. 
Photograph 1 shows a typical arable field margin, located on the eastern side of the railway. 
Plantation Woodland 
4.11 
There were a number of parcels of plantation woodland within the Survey Site. One of the larger 
and more structurally diverse parcels is located towards the north of the Survey Site adjacent to the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS (TN 1 & Photograph 2). This semi-mature plantation woodland contained a 
mix of deciduous and coniferous species, including alder Alnus glutinosa, pedunculate oak 
Quercus robur, ash Fraxinus excelsior, field maple Acer campstre and silver birch Betula pendula. 
The core of the woodland had a dense canopy and therefore a sparse shrub layer and ground 
flora. 
4.12 
Another area of plantation woodland, immediately south of South Pillinge Farm (TN 2) was also of 
note. This block of plantation woodland comprised broadleaved species and was also semi-mature. 
Planted poplar Populus sp. was abundant (locally dominant) within the canopy, and occasional 
Lombardy poplar Populus nigra “italica” lined the western edge, which is also delineated by a ditch 
and hedgerow with hawthorn and crack willow Salix fragilis. The shrub layer was relatively dense 
and included frequent hawthorn Crataegus monogyna with occasional field maple Acer campestre 
and wych elm Ulmus glabra. The ground flora of this woodland parcel, similar to others, was 
sparse. 
4.13 
Other parcels of plantation woodland had similar properties to those described, although 
plantations to the south and east of the Survey Site tended to be used for pheasant rearing, so had 
characteristically poor ground floras attributed to the foraging activity of game birds. One exception 
was an area of recently planted broadleaved woodland, at TN 3, between Millbrook Road and the 
railway line. The young trees are establishing on what is presently unimproved neutral grassland 
characterised by coarse grasses and common fleabane Pulicaria dysenterica. 
Scrub and Tall Ruderal Vegatation 
4.14 
Scattered scrub was represented across the Survey Site in varying amounts, especially in 
association with edges of plantation woodland (e.g. TNs 1, 2 and 3). More dense stands of 
continuous scrub were associated with the railway corridor running north-south, through the centre 
of the Survey Site, and the sides of the access track to the north west (TN4). Hawthorn, blackthorn 
Prunus spinosa, elder Sambucus nigra and bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. were the main species 
that comprised the scrub habitat, although young silver birch and alder were locally abundant along 
the access track (Photograph 3). 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

11/08/2014 
4.15 
Tall ruderal vegetation, including common nettle Urtica dioica, hogweed Heracleum sphondylium 
cleavers Galium aparine and tall willowherbs (e.g. great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and 
rosebay willowherb Chamerion angustifolium) were found in varying proportions with the scrub. 
The most extensive area of tall ruderal vegetation was on the edge of plantation woodland, 
bordering a large arable field to the far south west of the Survey Site. 
Neutral Grassland 
4.16 
The neutral grassland habitat category is generally reserved for areas of grassland that are barely 
managed (unimproved) or show a lack of intensive management (semi-improved) and are 
characterised by grassland vegetation of neutral soils. Such grasslands are often (but not always) 
relatively species-rich. The best example of neutral grassland in the Survey Site was that to the 
south east corner of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (see TN 5 and Photograph 4). This area was on 
raised ground (elevated above the pit), was species-rich and was being invaded by scrub. Typical 
species included agrimony Agrimonia eupatoria, bird’s-foot-trefoil Lotus corniculatus, St John’s-
wort’s Hypericum sp. and yellow oat-grass Trisetum flavescens. 
4.17 
Several arable field margins, particularly in the northern and western parts of the Survey Site (TN 8 
and Photograph 5), and along the railway corridor showed evidence of semi-improved and 
unimproved neutral grassland, and were of slightly greater value than their species-poor 
counterparts further east and south across the Survey Site. Typical species of these margins, 
which were between 1 to 2 m wide, were red fescue Festuca rubra, false oat-grass Arrhenatherum 
elatius, common fleabane, creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, wild carrot Daucus carota, 
bramble, cow parsley Anthriscus sylvestris, hogweed and great willowherb. 
4.18 
Two other prominent areas of neutral grassland included an area within the wooded glade to the 
west of the Survey Site (TN 2), and in association with the young broadleaved plantation adjacent 
to the railway and Millbrook Road (TN3). 
Improved Grassland 
4.19 
One area of improved grassland, characterised by rye-grass Lolium perenne, was located to the 
west of the Survey Site. This was a small sheep grazed pasture immediately south of South 
Pillinge Farm. 
Ephemeral / Short Perennial Vegetation 
4.20 
The access track in the north-west of the Survey Site (see TN4 and Photographs 3 and 6) included 
the most interesting areas of ephemeral vegetation within the Survey Site. An extensive range of 
plants associated with the track was found here, albeit as a mosaic with other habitat types (e.g. 
tall ruderal vegetation, scrub, neutral grassland, bare earth); especially at the far north, close to the 
gateway where the target note (TN 4) is positioned. 
4.21 
Other extensive areas of ephemeral vegetation were located around the south western part of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS, and extending into an arable field (dissected by a ditch) that had been set 
aside (see Photographs 7, 8 and 9). Here the ephemeral vegetation was characterised by bristly 
oxtongue 
Helminthotheca 
echioides, 
sow-thistles 
Sonchus 
sp., 
scentless 
mayweed 
Tripleurospermum inodorum, common fleabane and, in damper soils, encroaching wood small-reed 
Calamagrostis epijegos. 
Swamp (reedbed) 
4.22 
Part of the Survey Site (to the north) encroaches onto Rookery Clay Pit CWS, most notably the 
southern pit.  Here the vegetation comprised a patchy mosaic of bare ground, ephemeral 
vegetation and swamp vegetation in the form of drying reedbed dominated by stunted common 
reed Phragmites australis. This land is being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) by the landowner and is due to be completed by December 2014. The most extensive 
areas of reedbed, dominated by healthier common reed, at a lower gradient were recognised as 
‘swamp’ under the Phase 1 Habitat classification, and other plants recorded here are provided at 
TN 6. 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

11/08/2014 
Standing water  
4.23 
There were three ponds within the Survey Site (see TN 7 and Photograph 9). These are located to 
the east and are positioned centrally in arable fields. The ponds themselves were mature, yet still 
with plenty of open water and marginal vegetation. This included species such as reedmace Typha 
latifolia which was dominant in two of the ponds, and broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton 
natans, which was a dominant aquatic plant in one of the ponds. 
Running water 
4.24 
A network of wet and damp (seasonally wet) ditches was present across the Survey Site. The 
ditches had steep sided earth banks and were quite shallow, with water depths ranging between 
just a few cm to 50 cm in depth. Aquatic and marginal macrophytes were relatively limited largely 
because of the heavy shading to most of the ditches from hedgerows running parallel to the ditch, 
and also due to them becoming periodically dry in summer / early autumn. 
4.25 
The ditch described at TN 8, at the centre of the Survey Site (see Photograph 5), had the most 
interest, primarily due to the open aspect of the ditch, especially along the section that ran east – 
west. 
Species-poor hedgerows 
4.26 
The majority of hedgerows across the Survey Site were of a uniform structure, being intensively 
managed (approximately 2 m in height and 1.5 m in width); and species-poor, being dominated by 
hawthorn. Other woody plants were to be found in the hedgerows, although none were found 
frequently enough for any hedgerow to merit designation as ‘species-rich’, and as such, none are 
likely to meet the criteria required to be ‘Important’ under the Hedgerow Regulations, 1997. The 
occasionally occurring woody species included: blackthorn, field maple Acer campestre, willow 
Salix sp., English elm Ulmus procera, wild privet Ligustrum vulgare, ash, hazel, elder, dog rose, 
bramble and ivy Hedera helix. The ground flora associated with the hedgerows was limited to 
coarse grasses, cow parsley, cleavers, common nettle, ivy and lords and ladies Arum maculatum. 
4.27 
A small number of hedgerows, especially those near to TN 1 and TN 2 were unmanaged and were 
up to 3 m in height, although the composition of woody species remained similar. 
Other habitats 
4.28 
Other habitats of limited ecological significance within the Survey Site included hard-standing 
(roads, surfaced tracks and pedestrian access) and the railway line running north –south, that splits 
the Survey Site down the centre. 
Invasive, non-native species 
4.29 
New Zealand pigmyweed Crassula helmsii was the only invasive, non-native species listed on 
Schedule 9, Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) that was recorded 
during the survey. This was confined to the Rookery Clay Pits CWS (southern pit). 
Habitats of Principal Importance  
4.30 
There were several habitats across the Survey Site which may be considered in relation to whether 
they merited inclusion as Habitats of Principal Importance (HPI) (s. 41; NERC Act 2006). These are 
discussed below, with reference to the relevant habitat description, provided by JNCC (BRIG, 
2008). 
Arable field margins 
4.31 
All field margins were established as grassland strips providing vehicular (4 x 4) access. None of 
these margins specifically provided benefits for wildlife, and as such are not considered to meet the 
requirements for this HPI. 
 
Millbrook Power Plant 
 
9 
11/08/2014 
Hedgerows 
4.32 
All hedgerows mapped within the Survey Site were over 20 m long and predominantly comprise 
native plants. Accordingly, these are classified as HPIs. 
Ponds 
4.33 
On vegetative characteristics alone, the three ponds within the Survey Site do not merit 
classification as HPIs. This is on the basis that the ponds did not support a diverse plant 
community.  .  
Open mosaic habitats on previously developed land 
4.34 
Taken together, the habitats across the northern part of the Survey Site, which lie within the 
Rookery Clay Pits CWS, merit inclusion under this HPI. All of the following criteria are met: 
 
The area of open mosaic habitat is at least 0.25 ha in size. The area of land within the Survey 
Site that is within the CWS far exceeds this amount; 
 
There is a known history of disturbance at the site (notably clay extraction); 
 
The site contained some vegetation, in this case, ephemeral / short perennial, tall ruderal, 
scrub, neutral grassland and swamp habitat types; 
 
The site contained unvegetated, loose bare substrate and vegetated pools were present, 
principally in the southern pit; and 
 
The site showed spatial variation, forming a mosaic of one or more of the early successional 
communities, plus bare substrate, within 0.25 ha. The access road and southern pit all 
included mosaics of habitat, with bare substrate being a feature at both. 
Lowland mixed deciduous woodland 
4.35 
The areas of planted woodland across the Survey Site displayed some characteristics of the HPI; 
however, given their age and general structure (e.g. sparse ground flora and often managed 
through game keeping interests), it is unlikely that these woodlands can be classified as this priority 
habitat type. Despite this, the planted woodland blocks do have intrinsic value and are likely to 
provide habitat for a range of species.

Target Note 4 
The access track to the north of the Survey Site was formed of compacted soil, rubble & rail ballast 
that was exposed bare ground due to the frequency of vehicular movement along the track. Either 
side of the track was a mosaic of scrub, tall ruderal vegetation, short perennial / ephemeral 
vegetation and narrow fringes of rabbit grazed neutral grassland. It is understood from the 
landowner that this area is regularly sprayed with herbicide in order to keep vegetation under 
control in areas previously cleared of great crested newts. The more species-rich area of this 
habitat mosaic was located at the gateway / entrance to the far north of the Survey Site, and in the 
area marked by the Target Note.

Juncus effusus. One pond had a covering of broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton natans at the 
centre of the pond. 
Target Note 8 
A section of ditch, approximately 700 m long that runs from east to west and is mostly unshaded. 
Unlike other ditch sections across the Survey Site, this section had more gently sloping banks, 
dominated by coarse grasses with patches of blackthorn Prunus spinosa and hawthorn Crataegus 
monogyna scrub, and a varied assemblage of marginal plants, which included: abundant fool's 
watercress Apium nodiflorum, great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and water mint Mentha 
aquatica; with occasional meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria and false-fox sedge Carex otrubae.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake invertebrate surveys of suitable habitats within the 
red-line of the Project Site, as reported in the Project Scoping Report (the ‘Survey Site’). The 
purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature review was also conducted, which 
covered the Project Site and land up to 2 km from this point. 
1.3 
The desk study revealed the presence of a significant (county value) invertebrate fauna associated 
with The Rookery. It is understood that habitats within Rookery South Pit (which occupies the 
southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS) is currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner.  Towards the end of 2014, the base of Rookery 
South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are 
required for the LLRS. 
1.4 
A total of 155 species were recorded from the Survey Site. Many of the species recorded are 
common and widespread across England. However, three of these are nationally scarce and eight 
of these are Species of Principal Importance, albeit only on account of their population declines 
over recent decades, which, according to the JNCC (2010) require further research. 
1.5 
This is an Interim Report.  Further surveys are programmed, for late August and early September 
2014. These surveys will include late summer surveys of terrestrial invertebrates (including moths 
and butterflies), and aquatic invertebrate surveys targeting the three ponds in the Survey Site.  A 
final report will be produced to incorporate these findings, which will accompany the DCO 
Application.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
Area within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas which extend from 
The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east.. The approximate centre 
of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and 
Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site is restricted to the best examples of suitable habitat within the red-line boundary of 
the Project Site as reported in the Project Scoping Report (as determined by an experienced 
entomologist). The Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 Appendix 2. The main habitats within the 
Survey Site are arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the 
north, an area of land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. This area presently includes sparsely vegetated 
ground, swamp and bare earth. Towards the end of 2014, the base of Rookery South Pit it is 
expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are required for the 
LLRS.  . 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including invertebrate surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the invertebrate survey were to identify whether any rare, scarce or nationally 
threatened species of invertebrate, including Species of Principal Importance were present, and if 
present, to evaluate their likely coverage across the Survey Site. 
2.7 
This report is an interim report. Further surveys are programmed for late August and early 
September 2014; targeting late summer terrestrial invertebrates (including moths and butterflies), 
and aquatic invertebrates of the three ponds in the Survey Site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected species was requested from the Bedfordshire 
and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering the Project Site and 
land up to 2 km from the Project Site boundary. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi 
Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and 
aerial photography of the area were also reviewed. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS), including land within and 
immediately north of the Survey Site (PBA, 2009). 
Habitat Potential Assessment 
3.3 
On 8 May 2014, the Survey Site (shown on Figure 1) was assessed by Dr Ian Fairclough MCIEEM, 
an experienced entomologist, for its suitability to support important invertebrate communities. 
3.4 
Notes were made of the habitats present, which were documented in a photographic record. 
Habitats were assessed for their potential to support important invertebrate communities.  To 
enable a full characterisation of the Survey Site for invertebrates this included observations of 
features that might limit invertebrate interest as well as those which might be of particular value for 
invertebrates. In particular, emphasis was placed on the following features (where present): 
 
Mature open grown trees and veteran trees: especially those with large volumes of standing 
dead wood; 
 
Woodland edge and scrub: especially where there is a diverse vegetation structure and 
species composition; 
 
Species-rich grassland: especially that in association with scrub, with a high proportion of 
plants providing nectar and pollen, and with a varied vegetation structure; 
 
Early successional habitat: (e.g. cliff faces, quarries, eroded banks, periodically disturbed bare 
or sparsely vegetated ground) especially on free-draining ground where there is a high 
proportion of exposed bare earth; and 
 
Wetland: including watercourses (e.g. ditches, flushes and seepages), standing water or 
waterbodies (e.g. ponds, lakes and swamp) and associated terrestrial habitat (e.g. wet heath 
and marshy grassland). 
3.5 
A number of habitats were identified during the survey with the potential to support important 
invertebrate communities (which are described further in the results section). Subsequent 
invertebrate surveys were designed, to target key indicator groups of invertebrates within the 
Survey Site, namely Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Coleoptera (beetles) and Hemiptera (true 
bugs), associated with ditches, forb-rich grassland, and grassland and scrub matrix assemblages. 
The results of these targeted surveys were used to assess the main groups of invertebrate present 
within the Survey Site, and to provide an indication of the relative species diversity within the 
targeted groups. 
3.6 
Three ponds occur within the Survey Site, which may be of importance to aquatic invertebrates. 
Surveys for these will be conducted in late August 2014, and the findings incorporated within the 
final report. 
Targeted Survey for Terrestrial Invertebrates (non-Lepidoptera) 
3.7 
Features within the Survey Site that provided the most suitable habitat for these taxonomic orders 
were selected for targeted survey.  These included a range of typical, yet more suitable vegetation 
structures, including: transitional habitat along well established field margins close to ditch margins 
and hedgerows. Across these, the following sampling methods were employed: pitfall traps, sweep 
netting, beating and grubbing. These methods are described below. Whilst Coleoptera and 
 
Millbrook Power Plant 
 
5 
13/08/2014 
Hemiptera formed the focus of the survey, incidental records of other invertebrate taxa were also 
recorded. Surveys were conducted on 9 and 20 May 2014 by Dr Ian Fairclough. 
Pitfall Traps 
3.8 
Pitfall traps were set out in clusters of three, at two locations within the Survey Site (shown on 
Figure 1). Pitfall trapping involved the use of circular plant pot trays (24 cm diameter x 5 cm depth) 
that were sunk into a circular hole that was excavated using a spade.  The trays were installed 
such that the tray rims were flush with the surrounding ground level.  Preserving fluid, comprising 1 
part ethylene glycol (antifreeze) to 3 parts water, was poured into the trays until they were half full.  
A drop of detergent was added to the fluid to break the surface tension and lastly, a layer of mesh 
(aperture size 2 cm x 1 cm) was balanced over the tray to prevent capture of small mammals, 
amphibians and reptiles.  Photograph 1 (Appendix 1) shows a pitfall trap deployed within the 
Survey Site. The traps were operational during the period from 9 and 20 May 2014. Pitfall trapping 
is considered to be an effective method for the sampling of ground dwelling beetles, particularly 
those belonging to the family Carabidae (ground beetles). 
Sweep Netting 
3.9 
Sweep netting involved walking at a steady pace through the vegetation and passing an 
entomologist’s sweep net back and forth through vegetation in a figure of eight motion. This 
method is particularly suitable for capturing phytophagous (foliage-feeding) families such as 
Curculionidae (weevils), Chrysomelidae (leaf or flea beetles), Nitidulidae (pollen beetles) and 
Cantharidae (soldier beetles). Sweep netting is also an effective method for collecting many 
families of bugs, although the Miridae (capsid bugs) can often be the most numerous both in 
number of individuals and number of species. 
Beating 
3.10 
Beating is a useful technique for extracting beetles from overhanging branches. This method 
involves placing a beating tray beneath a branch before delivering several sharp blows to the 
branch and sending any dislodged invertebrates into the beating tray for inspection. This method 
may uncover a diverse array of beetle families (similar to those found during the sweeping), and 
occasionally producing a Cerambycid (longhorn beetle) or Elaterid (click beetle). The Pentatomidae 
and Acanthosomatidae (shield bugs) are two of many Hemipteran families recorded using this 
method. 
Grubbing 
3.11 
Grubbing is the name generally applied to the extraction of invertebrates by hand from a variety of 
mediums such as denser grass tussocks, where a thatch has developed, often with patches of 
pleurocarpous (spreading and branched) mosses. To assist in the detection of small beetles (e.g. 
Staphylinidae (rove beetles)), moss and leaf litter were sieved or placed in a bucket of water to 
capture invertebrates struggling to the surface. 
Weather Conditions 
3.12 
For both survey visits the weather had been warm if slightly unsettled in the preceding weeks. On 
the day of the survey conducted on 9 May 2014, the weather was dry, cloudy and warm (maximum 
temperature 20°C), with a light wind. During the survey visit undertaken on 20 May 2014 the 
weather was dry, fairly hot (maximum temperature 23°C) and overcast with occasional sunny 
spells, with a light wind. The weather conditions were optimal for both surveys. 
Sample Sorting and Identification 
3.13 
Whilst some species could be identified in the field, the majority of specimens were stored in 70% 
methanol solution for later identification, using a stereoscopic microscope with the aid of 
identification literature. Experienced entomologist, Don Stenhouse FRES, assisted in the 
identification of terrestrial invertebrates collected from the field.

Targeted Survey for Butterflies 
3.14 
On 30 July 2014, Dr Jim Fairclough visited the Survey Site to conduct a walked butterfly transect 
survey. This survey was the first of two to be conducted over the summer, the second of which will 
be conducted in late August. 
3.15 
A transect route was selected that covered a large proportion of the typical habitats of the whole of 
the Survey Site (encompassing the more suitable areas for butterflies) and took approximately two 
and a half hours to complete. This transect route is shown on Figure 1. The method used an 
adapted protocol for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Thus: 
 
Timed counts were made between 10:00 and 16:30 hours, and only carried out in warm, bright 
and dry weather, with no more than moderate winds. 
 
A transect route was devised (Figure 1), which was split into sections, each section being of 
similar length and covering habitat typical of the Survey Site. 
 
Each section was walked at a slow, steady pace counting all butterflies seen within a fixed 
distance, 2.5 m either side of the transect line and 5 m ahead. 
 
Care was taken to maintain a steady pace and avoid waiting at favoured hotspots to improve 
the count and bias the results. 
 
Butterfly numbers and % sunshine in each section were recorded using the standard UKBMS 
proforma. Wind speed was estimated using the Beaufort scale (0 - no wind, 6 - very strong 
wind). 
3.16 
During the survey the wind speed was measured as 2 (light wind) and the average temperature 
was 25°C. 
Targeted Survey for Moths 
3.17 
On 18 June 2014 a night-time moth survey was undertaken, which was the first of two to be 
conducted over the summer, the second of which will be conducted in late August. The survey was 
conducted by Peter Newbold MCIEEM and Ross Crates MCIEEM, both ecologists competent in 
moth surveys and identification. Two Robinson moth traps were used, each fitted with mercury 
vapour bulbs to attract as many moths as possible. The traps were positioned in areas within the 
Survey Site that were expected to give the greatest range of species, yet in locations that were 
typical of the types of habitat prevailing at the Survey Site (notably field margins close to 
hedgerows and ditches) (see Figure 1 for trap locations). 
3.18 
Weather conditions during the survey were optimal; warm and humid (overnight low of 16°C) and 
with little or no wind. 
3.19 
The lights were switched on at dusk and remained lit until the generator powered down after at 
least four hours running time. The traps were checked periodically throughout the night to log any 
new arrivals. Any species hard to identify from external markings alone, and those requiring further 
confirmation, were retained and dissected if necessary to ascertain their identity. 
Survey Limitations 
3.20 
Seasonal surveys such as those carried out at the Survey Site are liable to be biased, to some 
extent, by the life histories of the invertebrate species themselves, a proportion of which may be 
found in spring, or in autumn, for example. The prevailing state of the vegetation will also play an 
important role. In the present case, much of the determination of interest depends on the quality of 
established field margin habitat, either specifically or as part of a wider mosaic with other boundary 
features, and the appearance and apparent value of vegetation can vary over the course of a year, 
as different plant species grow and come into flower, and as the exact nature of management, and 
its consequences for invertebrates, become apparent. For example, it is unlikely that identical 
conclusions may have been drawn from a survey conducted in mid-spring, or early-autumn. 
3.21 
Allied to this, two or three visits targeting two or three insect orders can only detect a proportion of 
the total species pool using a site. However, it does provide the opportunity to investigate the 
assemblage types present and to gauge where the most important parts of the Survey Site for 
invertebrates are most likely to be found. Furthermore, the setting of pitfall traps, to some extent, 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

helps negate restricted survey effort (especially for ground dwelling invertebrates), since the traps 
are operational and collecting target groups over a prolonged period of time.

Results and Interpretation 
Desk Study 
4.1 
An invertebrate scoping survey followed by nine site visits to collect invertebrates was undertaken 
by BSG Ecology during 2008 (PBA, 2009). This suite of surveys identified 483 species of 
invertebrates within Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS), some of which were of 
conservation importance. The Rookery Clay Pits CWS includes the southern clay pit of The 
Rookery, which falls within the Survey Site. Three species were classified as SPIs (Species of 
Principal Importance, NERC Act 2006); the small heath Coenonympha pamphilus, shaded broad-
bar moth Scotopteryx chenopodiata and cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae. All three are still 
widespread and common though declining. Amongst the 483 species recorded, 44 hold a Red Data 
Book or Nationally Scarce conservation status or merit one. The survey revealed Rookery Pits 
CWS as a site of county importance for invertebrate conservation and one of the best invertebrate 
sites in Bedfordshire. Most of the areas and habitat components sampled by the survey yielded 
Red Data Book or Nationally Scarce invertebrates. Aquatic and wetland habitats were richest in 
Red Data Book or Nationally Scarce invertebrate species but many species were associated with 
the grassland habitats and the bare and sparsely-vegetated ground, and some with a stand of 
poplars. 
4.2 
The desk study produced records of eighteen species of butterfly, all from within or adjacent to the 
Survey Site. These included the small heath, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, the wall Lasiommata 
megera and the grizzled skipper Pyrgus malvae, all of which are classified as SPI’s. In addition, 
records of 40 species of moth were obtained. The majority of these species were either recorded 
on site or within a 200 m radius of the Survey Site. Most of these species of moth are classified as 
SPIs. 
4.3 
All species of invertebrate recorded from the Survey Site that are of conservation significance (i.e. 
rare, scarce or nationally threatened species of invertebrate, including Species of Principal 
Importance) are listed in Appendix 3. 
Habitat Potential Assessment 
4.4 
The majority of the Survey Site comprised intensively managed agricultural land, characterised by 
large arable fields, grass-covered field margins and fairly recent, species-poor, yet intact 
hedgerows (dominated by hawthorn Crataegus monogyna) (see Photograph 2, Appendix 1). These 
were discounted from further study on the basis of the habitat being of poor suitability for 
invertebrates. Only common and widespread species might be expected to occur in association 
with such habitat. 
4.5 
The main exception to this agricultural land is the area that lies to the north of the Survey Site. This 
comprised the access track that was a mosaic of bare ground with ephemeral vegetation and scrub 
at varying density. Also to the north, within Rookery South Pit was a patchy mosaic of bare ground, 
ephemeral vegetation and swamp vegetation in the form of drying reedbed dominated by stunted 
common reed Phragmites australis. These areas north of the Survey Site, notably within Rookery 
South Pit are being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. 
Accordingly, despite these areas maintaining a high level of interest for invertebrates at the time of 
survey, they were discounted from further investigation for the present study as it was assumed 
that the baseline for this area will be set as the future baseline (at the end of 2014), which is likely 
to a remodelled landform of compacted bare earth. 
4.6 
Notwithstanding the above, there were several habitat types of potential interest to invertebrates 
within the Survey Site. These formed the focus of the surveys and are summarised below. 
Established Boundary Features 
4.7 
As mentioned earlier, the hedgerows, which were more numerous in the east of the Survey Site, 
were of a uniform structure, species-poor and therefore lacking any defining character that would 
make them of significant value to invertebrates. The margins were generally species-poor, being 
dominated by grasses and lacking in forbs. However, there were several field boundaries, 
 
Millbrook Power Plant 
 
9 
13/08/2014 
particularly in the northern and western parts of the Survey Site, which are of slightly greater value 
(see Photographs 3, 4 and 5). In most cases, these included hedgerows and / or ditch banks with 
south-facing aspects and a wider variety of forbs, including species that are good pollen and nectar 
sources such as common fleabane Pulicaria dysenterica, wild carrot Daucus carota, bramble 
Rubus fruticosa agg, hogweed Heracleum sphondylium and great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum. 
Hedgerows at these locations were generally more complex and well-structured providing a 
permanent feature for hibernating invertebrates. Furthermore, they would have broken up the fields 
to add additional heterogeneity, and potentially warmth, at least close to the ground, which would 
likely to have been of particular benefit to butterflies. The ditches also contributed to the diversity of 
microhabitats for invertebrates, offering a more humid environment at the ditch bases, for ground 
beetles and rove beetles and, supporting a different assemblage of plants (e.g. watercress Rorippa 
nasturtium-aquaticum, water mint Mentha aquatica and meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria), which 
in turn can support a wider range of phytophagous (foliage feeding) invertebrates, such as weevils 
and various true bugs. 
Wooded Copses (Plantations) 
4.8 
There were several wooded copses across the Survey Site. Some were very recent, so were 
established on grassland habitat which was still prevalent. Others were somewhat older, yet still 
betrayed their origin as plantation woodland, due to a typically shaded and poorly developed 
ground flora and understorey, and a single age structure of trees. Pheasant were reared in some, 
which can also be detrimental to invertebrates as the pheasants will scour the ground feeding on 
ground dwelling invertebrates and nipping at young vegetation, stunting its growth. Copses fitting 
these descriptions would generally be of limited importance for terrestrial invertebrates. They have 
no features of antiquity such as a large volume of standing and fallen dead wood, rot holes, sap 
runs and cavities that would attract a more specialised dead wood (saproxylic) invertebrate fauna. 
4.9 
However, the most established copses within the Survey Site such as that immediately south of 
South Pillinge Farm (close to Butterfly Transect BT8, see Figure 1) could be expected to act as 
reservoirs, supporting more invertebrates than would be found in the wider intensively farmed 
landscape. Here the woodland was complemented with grassland where a ride cut through the 
woodland, and patches of ruderal vegetation (including nettle, thistles and umbellifers) provided 
transition zones that would often be rich in invertebrates, due to the structural diversity. The added 
height and often permanency of these features makes them important refuges for invertebrates 
especially during winter when penetrating frosts may otherwise have adverse consequences. The 
scrub which was also prevalent in this area would have been an important food source. In early 
and mid-spring, blackthorn and hawthorn are valuable reservoirs of nectar and pollen for bees, 
wasps, moths and beetles. Later in summer / early autumn they provide a source of food (fruit) for 
fruit feeding species. 
Ponds 
4.10 
There were three ponds within the Survey Site (see, for example, Photograph 6). These were 
located to the east and were positioned centrally in arable fields. Whilst being quite isolated, these 
ponds are still likely to have been important reservoirs for invertebrates. The wide field margins 
surrounding the ponds offered a buffer to the drift of chemicals used by the farmer, and the ponds 
themselves were mature, yet still with plenty of open water and marginal vegetation. This included 
species such as amphibious bistort Persicaria amphibia, bittersweet Solanum dulcumara, 
reedmace Typha latifolia and soft rush Juncus effusus. The range of species potentially associated 
with ponds is unequalled, with such habitat typically well represented by a range of snails, diving 
beetles (Dytiscidae), water beetles (Hydrophilidae), dragonflies (Odonata) and caddisflies 
(Trichoptera). 
Terrestrial Invertebrates (non-Lepidoptera) 
4.11 
In total 84 invertebrate taxa were identified, 83 of these to species level. Beetles made up most of 
the records (53 species). The next most recorded order was the true bugs followed by the bees, 
wasps and ants (Hymenoptera). The full list of invertebrates recorded within the Survey Site is

displayed in tabular format in Appendix 4.  The results of the survey were analysed by measuring 
the number of locally rare, nationally notable and IUCN red-list / RDB1 species. 
4.12 
Overall, the majority of the insects recorded are widely distributed and common, with fifteen 
regarded as more local and two of Notable status. These notable species are discussed further in 
Table 1, below.

(Notable B) 
This species prefers dry soils on insolated sites, although 
its habitat preferences are not well understood. It is 
recorded mainly from the midlands and south-east of 
England. It was taken from a pitfall trap, positioned along 
a field boundary (close to a ditch) to the north. 
Microplontus 
triangulum 
(a 
weevil) 
Nationally 
Scarce 
(Notable B) 
Records are mainly from the east and south-east of 
England with a few records found as far north as Cumbria. 
It has been recorded from roadside verges, field margins, 
grassland and disturbed ground. According to Morris 
(2008) it is ‘Notable B (hardly reflecting its rarity)’ 
suggesting that he regards it as rarer, although as it is 
found on the very common yarrow Achillea millefolium it 
could be expected to be more common. It was taken 
during sweeping of field margin vegetation to the north of 
the Survey Site (sweep net area 1; Figure 1). 
                                                      
1 Status Definitions and Criteria of Invertebrate Groups:  for many invertebrate groups, species rarity has often been gauged by the 
number of national 10km grid squares in which they occur.  The fewer the “spots on a map”, the rarer it is.  This, however, does not 
exactly equate with how threatened a species is, since some species may be naturally confined to very few localities but are very 
abundant where they do occur and under no immediate threat of extinction.  The matter of how threatened the “rarest” species are has 
been addressed in a series of Red Data Books (RDB), such as for insects (Shirt, 1987).  Here, the listing as RDB1 (Endangered), RDB2 
(Vulnerable) and RDB3 (Rare) is an assessment of how threatened or endangered the species is in Britain, rather than how scarce it is 
in terms of map spot counting. 
Over the last decade the RDB categories are slowly being replaced by IUCN red-list categories (Critically Endangered, Endangered and 
Vulnerable), which use different criteria to those developed for the RDBs. However, this process is slow, and IUCN categories are not 
available for all groups. Accordingly, wherever IUCN categories have been allocated, these are also shown. 
Below RDB status, less rare but still significant species can be defined as Nationally Scarce (formerly called Nationally Notable), which 
is often sub-divided into Na (scarce), Nb (less scarce). These sub-categories are based on 10 kilometre square spot counting for the 
Great Britain grid system.  The Na sub-category represents scarce taxa that are thought to occur in 30 or fewer 10 km squares of the 
Great Britain grid system.  The Nb sub-category represents less scarce taxa that occur in 31 to 100 10 km squares.  Taxa in the N- sub-
category are those listed as ‘Notable’, but not always distinguished into sub-category Na or Nb in the relevant review. These species are 
thought to occur in 16 to 100 10 km squares of the National Grid but are too poorly known for their status to be more precisely 
estimated. 
The concept of ‘Local’ is less well defined, but comprises species of distinctly limited or restricted distribution, with such limitations being 
brought about by climate controls, dependency on a scarce habitat type, host (in the case of parasitic species) or similar ecological 
factor.  In this present study, the Local status of species is as per the Recorder database package developed by JNCC.

4.14 
The diversity of butterfly species is typical for a site of this type and location. The species recorded 
are generally considered to be common and widespread across central and southern England. 
4.15 
The most notable find during the survey was that of the shaded broad-bar, a geometrid moth that 
occupies a wide range of habitats including dunes, downs, waste ground and grassland. The larvae 
feed on vetches and clovers. Whilst this is regarded as a widespread and moderately common 
species, it’s inclusion on Section 41 of the NERC Act 2006 relates to a reported decline of 73% 
over 35 years for this species, which is triggering the need for further research into its decline 
(JNCC, 2010). 
Moths 
4.16 
The night-time survey produced 57 taxa of moth, 56 of which were recognisable as species (see 
Appendix 4). 
4.17 
Eight species collected were particularly noteworthy, due to their status either as a nationally 
notable species, or their inclusion as a SPI (S. 41; NERC Act 2006). Table 3, below gives more 
detailed information about each species and their habitat requirements.

associated with a variety of broadleaved trees and 
shrubs (e.g. hawthorn, blackthorn, apple and oak), so it 
would have been well suited to the hedgerows and

According to Sterling & Parsons (2012), this species has 
a very localised distribution, principally across south east 
England. The moth is associated with reedbeds, 
especially coastal reedbeds, although gravel pits are 
also favoured. The larvae feed internally on the young 
shoots of common reed and reed sweet-grass. The 
discovery of this species at the Survey Site will most 
certainly have been in association with the swamp in 
The Rookery, most likely Rookery South Pit, which was 
closest to the moth traps.

According to Waring & Townsend (2003), this species is 
common across England. The moth is associated with a 
variety of herbaceous plants, but docks in particular, so 
it would have been well suited to the field margins, 
hedgerows and copses within the Survey Site.

common across England. The moth is almost exclusively 
associated with common ragwort, so it would have been 
well suited to better established field margins within the 
Survey Site.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake great crested newt Triturus cristatus (GCN) 
surveys, of ponds within the red-line boundary of the Project Site (as reported in the Project 
Scoping Report), and to a distance of up to 250 m from this (the ‘Survey Site’).  The Survey Site for 
the reptile surveys comprised suitable habitat within the Project Site. The purpose of the surveys 
was to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. 
A supporting desk study and literature review was also conducted, which covered the Project Site 
and land up to 2 km from this. 
1.3 
This is an Interim Report. The results of the GCN surveys are complete; however, a final reptile 
survey is programmed for late-August/ early-September 2014.  A final report will be produced to 
incorporate these findings, which will accompany the DCO Application.    
Great Crested Newts 
1.4 
The desk study revealed the presence of a large population of GCN associated with Rookery North 
Pit. This population is formed from GCN that are being translocated from Rookery South Pit, which 
is currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner, 
under licence to Natural England. It is understood that the translocation of GCN from Rookery 
South Pit will be completed in 2014. 
1.5 
Thirteen ponds were surveyed in total as part of the field survey. These excluded the ponds in 
Rookery North Pit, for which current data exists confirming a large population in this area. The 
survey revealed the presence of GCN in eight of 13 ponds surveyed. These are represented by 
four separate populations, all with medium or small populations, which are broadly located to the 
east, south and west of the Survey Site. The population recorded to the east includes the only 
ponds occupied by GCN that are within the Project Site. 
Reptiles 
1.6 
The desk study revealed the presence of a low population of grass snakes Natrix natrix and a 
medium population of common lizards Zootoca vivipara associated with The Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS. Reptiles are being translocated from Rookery South Pit, which is currently the subject of an 
ongoing LLRS. Again, it is understood that the translocation of reptiles from Rookery South Pit will 
be completed in 2014. 
1.7 
Surveys identified the presence of common lizard Zootoca vivipara and grass snake Natrix natrix 
within the Project Site, specifically along the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor and land to the 
west of this. Peak adult count of common lizard and grass snake were eight and three respectively. 
These figures may need to be revised following the seventh and final survey visit, programmed for 
late summer.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
Area within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas which extend from 
The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre 
of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and 
Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site includes all ponds (water bodies) within the red-line of the Project Site, as reported 
in the Project Scoping Report, and to a distance of 250 m from this, as shown on Figure 1, 
Appendix 1.  The Survey Site for the reptile surveys includes all areas of habitat with suitability for 
reptiles within the Project Site, as shown on Figure 3. The main habitats within the Survey Site are 
arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the north, an area of 
land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) by the landowner. This area presently includes sparsely vegetated ground, swamp and 
bare earth. Towards the end of 2014, it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk 
movement of soils that are required for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including GCN and reptile surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in 
an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of surveys were to identify whether:  
 
Great crested newts (GCNs) were present in the ponds within the Survey Site, and if present, 
to estimate the population size; and  
 
Reptiles were present in suitable habitats within the Survey Site, and if present, to identify the 
species assemblage. (Note that a population estimate will be calculated following the seventh 
and final visit in late August/ early September 2014.)

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected species was requested from the Bedfordshire 
and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering the Survey Site and 
land up to 2 km  away. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic 
Information for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the 
area were also reviewed. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, including land within and immediately north of the Survey 
Site (PBA, 2009; BSG Ecology, 2013). 
Great Crested Newt 
The Survey Site 
3.3 
The Survey Site includes all ponds within the red-line boundary of the Project Site and to a 
distance of 250 m from this, which is shown on Figure 1. Guidance from Natural England (derived 
from the most recent Method Statement spreadsheet; Natural England, 2013) states that a 500 m 
search radius can be required in certain circumstances, which is normally when all the following 
conditions are met: 
a. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population, 
b. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority 
available locally, 
c. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
d. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
3.4 
In considering these conditions, it can be concluded that a 250 m search radius from the Project 
Site is appropriate, since not all the conditions are met, as described below. 
a. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population. This condition is met as a large population is 
present at Rookery North Pit (Section 4.0 provides further details). 
b. 
the footprint [Project Site] contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the 
majority available locally. The Project Site largely comprises intensively managed arable fields 
of low suitability to GCN. To the north (within Rookery South Pit) the Project Site includes land 
that is presently being restored as part of a LLRS. On completion of the restoration this land 
will be of low suitability for GCN. Outside the Project Site, particularly to the west, there are 
significant areas of semi-natural habitat that constitute excellent habitat for GCN. This includes 
habitat at the Vehicle Proving Ground, along the railway embankments / cuttings, and the 
Marston Vale Millennium Country Park. Accordingly, this condition is not met, and therefore no 
further consideration to the remaining two conditions is relevant. 
3.5 
In consideration of the Survey Site and the selection of ponds to a 250 m radius from the Project 
Site, it is also relevant to note that there are many suitable ponds in the surrounding landscape (up 
to 250 m from the Project Site) yet very few beyond this, therefore suggesting a lack of connectivity 
between such ponds (clustering) and limited opportunities for associated dispersal of GCN into the 
wider landscape. 
3.6 
In connection with the above point, where pond clustering occurs whereby a pond inside the 250 m 
radius from the Project Site is less than 250 m from a pond outwith the Project Site, the Survey Site 
has been extended to include this outer pond. This approach accords with the guidelines, and 
enables a full representation of the population size to be made, on the basis that GCN are 
assumed to readily move between ponds at this distance apart (English Nature, 2001).

Field Survey 
Habitat Suitability Assessment 
3.7 
During the field survey a HSI assessment of all ponds within the Survey Site was undertaken. 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a GCN HSI score to be derived for each pond by applying the scoring system developed by 
Oldham et al. in 2000 and updated by the Herpetological Conservation Trust in 2008 (HCT, 2008). 
The Habitat Suitability Index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each 
pond; these include size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are then 
used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the 
least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in one 
of five pre-defined categories defining its suitability for GCN as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8 
 
= excellent 
Amphibian Survey 
3.8 
Surveys were undertaken in accordance with survey techniques described in the Great Crested 
Newt Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001). Observations of GCN and other amphibian 
species of principal importance (S. 41; NERC Act 2006) were recorded. Three survey methods 
were employed on each of the 13 ponds during each survey, in accordance with standard 
methodology. These were a combination of bottle trapping, netting, torch light searches and/or egg 
searches, which are further described below. 
3.9 
Torch surveys: This method involved searching for GCN after sunset using 1 million candle power 
torches.  All accessible parts of a pond were slowly walked and searched.   
3.10 
Bottle trapping: Where water depth and bank side access allowed, bottle traps (constructed from 2 
litre plastic drinks bottles) were set in suitable parts of a pond at dusk and left in place overnight.  
Bottle traps were checked for amphibians the following morning within 12 hours of setting and any 
animals caught were released at the point of capture.   
3.11 
Netting: A long-handled dip-net was used for sampling suitable parts of a pond for amphibians.  
Where access permitted, all suitable parts of the pond were searched for GCN.  Results from 
netting are only useful for indicating presence/likely absence, and not population size. 
3.12 
Egg search: Egg searches were conducted in order to determine whether GCN were breeding in 
the ponds.  This involved searching marginal and aquatic vegetation for the distinctive leaf folding 
pattern and egg of GCN. Results from egg searches are only useful for indicating presence/likely 
absence, and not population size. The presence of GCN eggs is also a measure of attempted 
breeding at a pond. 
Great Crested Newt Population Assessment Survey 
3.13 
In order to estimate the population size class for ponds containing GCN, the peak adult count per 
pond per visit recorded through either torching or bottle-trapping must be determined. Where ponds 
supporting GCN occur within 250 m of each other, and are not separated by a significant barrier to 
dispersal, the population size class is indicated by the peak adult count summed across all 
connected ponds on a single survey visit through either torching or bottle-trapping. Populations can 
then be classed as: 
 
‘small’ for maximum counts of up to 10 adults; 
 
‘medium’ for maximum counts between 11 and 100; or 
 
‘large’ for maximum counts exceeding 100 adults.

Amphibian Survey Details 
3.14 
The surveys were conducted over a period of approximately eight weeks with four visits undertaken 
in the period mid-April to mid-May. They were conducted by Dr Jim Fairclough (JF) MCIEEM (GCN 
Licence Number: CLS001611), Peter Newbold (PN) MCIEEM (GCN Licence Number: 
CLS001717), Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, Dr Angie Julian (AJ) (GCN Licence Number: 
CLS02421), John Woods (JW) GradCIEEM, Elly Pattullo (EP), Ross Crates (RC), Francesca 
Morini (FM), Tom Chapman (TM) and Klare Chamberlain (KC).  Table 1, below, summarises the 
dates on which the surveys were undertaken and weather conditions, which were favourable during 
all surveys.

Limitations of Study 
3.15 
No survey of Pond J was undertaken during visit 1 due to access restrictions. Given that three (of 
five) surveys of Pond J were undertaken during the period mid-April to mid-May, the period within 
which GCN counts are expected to peak, and in accordance with the Great Crested Newt 
Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001), the population size-class assessment based on the 
survey results of Pond J is considered to be robust. Furthermore, the peak GCN count in Pond J 
was 28 adults (visit 4). An additional survey would have been highly unlikely to identify a large 
population size-class (GCN count exceeding 100). 
Reptiles 
Field Survey 
3.16 
The reptile survey was undertaken in accordance with good practice guidance, including that set 
out in the Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent et al., 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance 
(Froglife, 1999). 
3.17 
The presence/likely absence of reptiles at the Survey Site was established through the use of 
artificial refugia in combination with a visual search of the Survey Site, as described below. 
Artificial Refugia 
3.18 
Artificial refugia (roofing felt or corrugated metal sheets measuring between c. 0.5 m x 0.5 m and c. 
0.5 m x 1.0 m) were placed in locations assessed during the Phase 1 Habitat survey as being 
suitable for use by basking reptiles. Refugia were placed in a variety of aspects to enable survey 
findings to be indicative of use of the Survey Site by reptiles at different times of day, but where 
possible, favouring southerly aspects that would remain warm all day. 
3.19 
Suitable habitat for reptiles within the Survey Site is limited to a network of hedgerows and ditches, 
rough grassland, tall ruderal vegetation, patchy scrub and woodland edges. This was calculated to 
be approximately 20 ha in total. Accordingly, a total of 200 refugia were deployed: 180 on 17th April 
2014, 13 days ahead of the first survey visit; and an additional 20 on 30th May, incorporated into 
the survey from visit 4 onwards to reflect revisions to the Survey Site boundary. The average 
refugia density in areas of suitable reptile habitat was approximately 10 per hectare. This accords 
with the best practice recommended refugia density of 5-10 refugia per hectare (Froglife, 1999), 
enabling a robust assessment of the presence/likely absence of reptiles and an approximate 
estimate of the population size to be made. 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

3.20 
During each survey visit, the refugia were inspected for any reptiles basking on the upper surface, 
then lifted and checked for sheltering animals beneath before being carefully replaced. Potential 
reptile refuges already present on the Survey Site, such as discarded wood and large debris, were 
also inspected for the presence of reptiles. 
Visual Search 
3.21 
A visual search for reptiles within suitable habitats across the Survey Site was also undertaken 
during each survey visit. This helped to ensure that all areas were fully considered in the survey 
and helped eliminate a bias towards those reptile species more likely to use refugia. Visual 
searches involved walking slowly around the Survey Site in order to systematically search potential 
basking areas for reptiles in the areas between artificial refugia locations (Froglife, 1999). 
Reptile Survey Details  
3.22 
The following information was recorded during each reptile survey visit: species present; number of 
individuals present; approximate life stage (e.g. adult); location (refugia number or marked on map 
if visual encounter); date, survey start and finish times; and weather conditions. 
3.23 
Surveys were carried out during suitable weather conditions. Dates of the survey visits along with 
survey timings and weather conditions are provided in Table 2. Visits were undertaken on seven 
occasions in total, by Dr Jim Fairclough (JF) MCIEEM, Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, and 
John Woods (JW) Grad CIEEM (Table 1). (Note that the seventh and final survey visit is yet to be 
undertaken).

Results and Interpretation 
Great Crested Newts 
Desk Study 
4.1 
Surveys for GCN were undertaken in and around the Rookery Clay Pit CWS in 2008 (PBA, 2009). 
The presence of a large population of GCN was subsequently confirmed during these surveys. 
Trapping and translocation of newts has since taken place under a mitigation licence issued by 
Natural England in 2011. This has affected the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
incorporating the southern portion of the proposed access track and a proportion of the arable land 
in the north of the Survey Site, and had yielded over 6,000 GCNs (up to the end of July 2014), 
which were subsequently moved to receptor areas in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (400 
m east of the proposed access track) and a receptor area named Stewartby Way 2 (SW2) to the 
east of the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor. At the present time, the translocation programme 
is continuing in the south of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (Rookery Pit South) and is expected to be 
completed by November 2014. 
Habitat Suitability Assessment 
4.2 
During the field survey, 13 ponds were identified within the Survey Site. The locations and HSI 
scores attributed to these ponds are shown on Figure 1 (Appendix 1). A full description of each of 
the ponds, along with HSI scores, is included in Appendix 2. 
Amphibian Surveys 
4.3 
Eight ponds were found to contain GCN (Figure 2, Appendix 1). Evidence of egg-laying, which 
indicates breeding activity, was found in each of these ponds. In addition, eight ponds were found 
to support common toad Bufo bufo, a species of principal importance (s. 41; NERC Act 2006). A 
summary of the survey results can be found in Table 3 below, along with a note on the presence of 
common toad. Full survey results are detailed in Appendix 3 and selected photographs (referenced 
in Table 3) in Appendix 4.

Great Crested Newt Population Size Class Assessment 
4.5 
Four population clusters were identified, whereby a ‘population’ is defined as a collection of ponds 
where there is reasonable certainty of regular interchange of individuals between ponds (typically, 
within 250 m of each other and with an absence of barriers to dispersal) (English Nature, 2001). 
These included three small size-class and one medium size-class GCN populations, as shown on 
Figure 2. Results of the assessment are summarised in Table 4, below.

The desk study revealed the presence of a low population of grass snakes Natrix natrix and a 
medium population of common lizards Zootoca vivipara associated with The Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS. Reptiles are being translocated from Rookery South Pit, which is currently the subject of an 
ongoing LLRS. 
Reptile Surveys 
4.8 
Two common species of reptile were recorded at the Survey Site, namely common lizard and grass 
snake. No other reptile species have been recorded. The results of the surveys are summarised in 
Table 5 below and the locations at which common lizards and grass snakes were recorded are 
shown in Figure 3, Appendix 1. Full survey results are included in Appendix 5.

A total of 22 adult and two juvenile common lizard observations were made throughout the first six 
survey visits, with a peak count of eight adults on visit one. Of these, 11 adult and one juvenile 
common lizard observations were made in Zone 11, a rough grassland field margin bordered to the 
north by a wooded copse and adjacent to the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor that divides the 
Project Site (Figure 3, Appendix 1). Common lizards were also observed in Zones 16 and 17 
(immediately south of the Project Site, adjacent to the railway corridor), Zone 7 (along the southern 
edge of a wooded plantation), Zone 4 (along to a wide, heavily vegetated ditch with structurally 
diverse bankside vegetation) and Zone 5 (along the eastern edge of a semi-natural broadleaved 
woodland plantation).

4.11 
Nine adult and three juvenile grass snakes were observed during the first six survey visits, with a 
peak count of three adults on visit 4. Of these, five adult and two juvenile grass snake observations 
were made in Zone 5. Single grass snake observations were made at Zones 3, 7, 12, 16 and 17 
(juvenile). 
4.12 
With the exception of Zone 17, which was immediately east of the railway corridor, no common 
lizards or grass snakes were observed to the east of the railway corridor that divides the Project 
Site. Potential reptile habitat on land to the east of the railway corridor was less suitable and limited 
to field boundaries typically consisting of species poor hedgerows, wet ditches and uniform 
grassland field margins (see for example photograph 6 (Appendix 4)). 
4.13 
A population estimate for reptiles across the Survey Site will be calculated following the seventh 
and final visit, programmed for late August 2014.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake breeding bird surveys of all habitats within the red-
line boundary of the Project Site, as reported in the Project Scoping Report, plus a 50m buffer (the 
‘Survey Site’). The purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature 
review was also conducted, which covered the Project Site and land up to 2 km from this. 
1.3 
The desk study returned records of 158 birds of conservation importance, the great majority of 
which were derived from the Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS). 
1.4 
The breeding bird survey revealed 65 bird species that were breeding (or potentially breeding) 
within the Survey Site. Thirty-one of these appear on one or more schedules or lists of species of 
conservation importance. Bearded tit, gadwall, redshank and ringed plover are all associated with 
the reedbed habitat and open water within the clay pits (Rookery Clay Pits CWS). The land where 
these birds were recorded (the southern clay pit) is in the process of being restored as part of a 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. Towards the end of 2014, the base of 
Rookery South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that 
are required for the LLRS and therefore, would not be expected to support these birds beyond the 
end of 2014.   
1.5 
During a bat survey a single barn owl was incidentally observed hunting. No evidence of breeding 
was found on site, but they are likely to be breeding in the local area and occasionally using the 
Survey Site for foraging.

Introduction 
Background to Commission 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas extending from The 
Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre of the 
Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and Milton 
Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site comprises the habitats within the red-line of the Project Site, as reported in the 
Project Scoping Report, along with a 50m buffer, as illustrated on Figure 1 Appendix 1. The main 
habitats within the Survey Site are arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads 
and lanes. To the north, an area of land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. This area presently includes sparsely 
vegetated ground, reedbed and bare earth. Towards the end of 2014 it is expected to comprise just 
bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are required for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including breeding bird surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The objective of the survey was to evaluate the bird assemblage using the Survey Site and identify 
key areas of habitat used by breeding birds, with particular attention to rare and notable bird 
species. This report aims to provide a list of bird species encountered and their breeding status (i.e. 
confirmed, probable or possible breeding on the Survey Site), and an estimate of the likely number 
of territories/colonies of bird species breeding on or close to the Survey Site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected and otherwise notable species was requested 
from the Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering 
the Survey Site and land up to 2 km away. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, including land within and immediately north of the Survey 
Site (PBA, 2009). 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The Survey Site was split into three sections; northern (comprising the existing access track, 
reedbed and disused clay pit (Rookery South Pit) and associated buffer), south-eastern and south-
western (both comprising predominantly arable farmland and small woodland copses to the east 
and west of the railway respectively). Three visits to each section were undertaken in the early 
morning by an experienced ornithologist, Ross Crates.  Survey duration on each visit was between 
3 and 5 hours.  
3.4 
In addition, two dusk surveys were conducted in peak breeding season to locate any 
crepuscular/nocturnal species such as barn owl Tyto alba, which may have been breeding or 
foraging on site. A building inspection of South Pillinge Farm was also conducted to survey for any 
barn owls potentially breeding in the farm buildings.

3.6 
During each visit the Survey Site was walked at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be 
identified and located.  Frequent stops were made to scan suitable habitats and to listen for singing 
and calling birds.  All accessible areas of suitable breeding habitat within the Survey Site boundary 
and immediately adjacent areas were approached to within 50 m. 
3.7 
During the survey the location and activity of each bird detected (including those seen or heard) 
was recorded and mapped using standard two-letter BTO species codes combined with activity 
symbols. 
3.8 
Birds exhibiting breeding behaviour were assigned to one of three categories: possible breeding, 
probable breeding or confirmed breeding.  These are defined below (based on BTO criteria): 
 
Possible breeding: birds heard singing or alarm calling or simply present in suitable breeding 
habitat on one of the survey visits; 
 
Probable breeding:  a pair of birds present in suitable breeding habitat; a repeat observation of 
territorial behaviour (song or alarm calling) on two or more different visits in the same location; 
courtship behaviour or display in suitable breeding habitat; birds apparently visiting a nest site; 
or, evidence of nest building (including excavation of a hole); 
 
Confirmed breeding: one or more adults undertaking a distraction display; the presence of a 
used nest or eggshells; the presence of recently fledged or downy young (that are clearly of 
local origin); apparently incubating adults or adults commuting to and from a nest hole; adult 
birds carrying faecal sacs or food for young; or, a nest with eggs or young present. 
3.9 
Internal inspections of all buildings around South Pillinge Farm were also undertaken. Records 
were taken of any evidence of breeding barn owls, this can include: 
 
Droppings (white vertical streaks on roof beams and large white splashes on floors)  
 
Pellets. Barn owls generally swallow their prey whole and regurgitate the indigestible parts 
(bones, fur etc.) as pellets. The colour and condition of pellets can give an indication as to 
when a site was last used by barn owls.  
 
Feathers. Barn owl nestlings begin their initial moult at 11 months. Adult barn owls tend to 
shed their largest and most noticeable feathers (wing feathers) in the summer.  
 
Millbrook Power Plant

26/08/2014 
 
Nest debris. Barn owls do not build nests but nesting areas may contain nestling fluff and 
pellet debris.  
 
Potential entrance points. The minimum hole size required for barn owls to gain access to 
a building is 7 cm by 7 cm.  
 
Suitable nesting platforms. Barn owls need a level area to lay their eggs usually over 3 
metres in length and over 3 metres off the ground. Typical nesting places include tops of 
walls, between bales and attic floors. 
3.10 
To inform the assessment in this report, the numbers of potential territories identified, the 
abundance of species at the county and national level, the quality of the habitat present and the 
geographical range of the birds concerned have been considered, based on national and regional 
accounts. The Bedfordshire Bird Report (Nightingale, 2012) was consulted to assess the local 
population and distribution of each individual bird species. 
3.11 
Due to the relative abundance of ornithological data, it is often possible to derive population 
estimates within a defined geographical area (e.g. county).  A 1 % threshold can then be applied to 
indicate importance (e.g. 1 % of the county population is equivalent to county importance).  There 
is no fundamental biological basis for the 1 % threshold, but it does follow the rational for site 
selection set out within the Ramsar Convention 1971 (Criterion 6: A wetland should be considered 
internationally important if it regularly supports 1% of the individuals in a population of one species 
or subspecies of waterbird), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s SPA selection 
guidelines (JNCC, 2014). It has also been adopted for the purposes of defining thresholds of 
importance of waterfowl at the European and UK level by the BTO in their Wetland Bird Survey 
reporting (BTO 2014a). The 1% threshold is therefore considered to provide a reasonable and 
defensible basis for the evaluation of bird populations. 
Limitations to Methods 
3.12 
As with all breeding bird surveys following this technique, the process is open to some subjectivity 
in interpretation except where active nests are located. Therefore, these ‘territories’ will be classed 
as putative and their mapped locations will indicate the ‘centre’ of a territory and not necessarily the 
breeding location.   
3.13 
All visits were conducted in suitable weather conditions and during the optimal period for breeding 
bird surveys. It is therefore not considered that any significant constraints were encountered.

Results and Interpretation 
Desk Study 
4.1 
Records of 158 birds of conservation importance have been recorded from within a 2 km radius of 
the Survey Site, which are presented in Appendix 2. Thirty-seven of these are Schedule 1 species 
(Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)), and are highlighted by the use of italics for the 
common name in the table included at Appendix 2. The great majority of the records are derived 
from the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. Of the 37 Schedule 1 species, the following 11 species have 
potential to be associated with the Survey Site as suitable nesting habitat is present: 
 
Barn owl Tyto alba – This species tends to forage upon tussocky grassland with a good litter 
layer providing habitat for their preferred prey species (field voles). The semi-improved 
grassland and tall ruderal vegetation mosaic on the periphery of the Survey Site is therefore 
considered to provide some foraging habitat for barn owls. In addition, it is possible that some 
of the outbuildings associated with South Pillinge Farm could support this species. 
 
Bittern Botaurus stellari – Bitterns have been recorded within the reedbed in the lake in the 
north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the proposed access track). The dense 
reedbed on the periphery of the lake in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the 
proposed access track) continues to provide suitable nesting and foraging habitat for this 
species. 
 
Bearded tit Panurus biarmicus – The bearded tit is found almost exclusively within dense 
reedbeds. The dense reedbed on the periphery of the lake in north of the Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS (adjacent to the proposed access track) provides suitable nesting and foraging habitat for 
this species. 
 
Cetti’s warbler Cettia cetti – This species nests in dense scrub and reedbed habitats and was 
recorded within reed habitat adjacent to the proposed access track in January 2014. 
 
Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus – The plantation woodland within the Survey Site is considered 
to offer some, yet limited potential nesting and foraging habitat for firecrest. 
 
Garganey Anas querquedula – This species of duck nests in dense vegetation including 
reedbed. Suitable nesting habitat for this species is therefore also present within the dense 
reedbed on the periphery of the lake to the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
 
Hobby Falco subbuteo – This species has been observed foraging over the water-bodies within 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS during great crested newt translocation works in 2011 and 2013 
(Steven Foot, pers comm.). The more established, mature trees present within and adjacent to 
the Survey Site have some potential to be used as nesting habitat for this spring/summer 
migrant. 
 
Little-ringed plover Charadrius dubius – This species breeds on man-made habitats close to 
fresh water. Sand and gravel quarries are regularly used as breeding sites. This species was 
recorded nesting on site in 2011 and 2013 upon clay habitats adjacent to the water-bodies in 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (Steven Foot, pers comm.). Accordingly, there remains suitable 
habitat for this species to the north of the Survey Site. 
 
Mediterranean gull Larus melanocephalus – This species is known to breed near inland lakes 
and wetlands. The water-bodies in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS provide suitable nesting habitat 
for this species. 
 
Marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus – This species nests in dense reedbed and has been 
recorded foraging over the reedbed present in the northern and south-eastern areas of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS in 2011 and 2013 (Steven Foot, pers comm.). 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

26/08/2014 
 
Red kite Milvus milvus – This species was recorded circling above the Survey Site during the 
preliminary ecology survey (BSG Ecology, 2014). The more established, mature trees present 
within and adjacent to the Survey Site have potential to be used as nesting habitat for this 
species. 
4.2 
A number of bird Species of Principal Importance (Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(NERC) 2006 (s. 41)) were also shown to be present within 2 km of the Survey Site in the results of 
the desk study. Of these, the following could potentially nest within the Survey Site as suitable 
habitat is present for these species: dunnock Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer 
domesticus, starling Sturnus vulgaris, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniculus, skylark Alauda 
arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, yellowhammer Emberiza 
citronella, cuckoo Cuculus canorus and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava flavissima. 
Field Survey 
4.3 
A total of 54 bird species that could be breeding within the Project Site were recorded during the 
three survey visits combined. These are summarised in Table 2 together with an estimated number 
of confirmed, probable or possible breeding territories/nest sites. The indicative central point of 
each territory or location of individual bird records is shown in Appendix 1, Figure 2 (northern half of 
the Survey Site) and Figure 3 (southern half of the Survey Site).

A further nine additional species were recorded breeding outside the Project Site but within the 
Survey Site. Three additional species were assumed to be breeding within the wider area but were 
of relevance to this report due to their conservation significance. These are summarised in Table 3 
together with an estimated number of territories/nest sites. The indicative central point of each 
territory or location of individual bird records is also shown where appropriate in Appendix 1, Figure 
2.

In addition to the above, a further twelve bird species were recorded during the survey visits for 
which no evidence of breeding within the Survey Site was noted. This included individuals flying 
over the Survey Site or species which may breed locally but for which suitable nesting habitat 
either does not occur on the Survey Site, or where no behaviour suggesting breeding was 
recorded. These species are summarised in Table 4 below together with notes on use of the 
Survey Site.

on the boundary of the Survey Site, during 
the crepuscular survey. The banks at this 
location were not vertical or overhung 
(which is preferred by kingfisher), so it is 
unlikely that kingfisher would breed here.

4.8 
Barn owl. During a bat survey a single bird was observed hunting. No evidence of breeding was 
found within the Survey Site, including during the building inspection of South Pillinge Farm, but 
they are likely to be breeding in the local area and occasionally using the Survey Site for foraging. 
In general the Survey Site is very low quality foraging habitat for barn owls, predominantly 
consisting of large arable fields with very small field margins. The areas of higher quality foraging 
habitat include the areas of rank grassland along the margins of the woodland copses, the 
grassland surrounding South Pillinge Farm and the railway corridors. 
4.9 
Bearded tit. This is a species of extensive reedbed, principally in more coastal counties. During the 
surveys at least two birds were heard amongst common reed Phragmites australis (their breeding 
habitat) just outside the 50 m buffer zone to north-east of the Survey Site. A further pair was heard 
in the reedbed within the clay pit in the north-east of the site. 
4.10 
Bittern. A single male was heard booming to the north east, beyond the Survey Site boundary. 
There is currently no breeding habitat suitable for bittern within the Survey Site. The reedbed in the 
clay pit within the Project Site is currently drying out as the water is pumped away from this area to 
promote the implementation of the LLRS by the end of 2014, so the Project Site, or indeed, the 
Survey Site is unlikely to support suitable habitat for bittern by 2015. 
4.11 
Bullfinch. The bullfinch is a generalist species that normally breeds within dense hedges (Snow and 
Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). One confirmed pair had fledged young near the road 
bridge over the railway. The second probable pair bred in bushes near the northern entrance track. 
The final possible pair could have bred in the wooded copse to the west of the Survey Site. The 
site had one confirmed, one probable and one possible breeding pair. 
4.12 
Common tern. No evidence of breeding tern was found within the Survey Site, but four pairs are 
estimated to be breeding in the local area. 
4.13 
Cuckoo. The cuckoo’s favoured habitat is open woodland but females lay their eggs in the nest of 
other species (Dunnock, Reed Warbler and Meadow Pipit are favoured 'hosts') (Snow and Perrins, 
1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had two probable and one possible breeding 
pairs. 
4.14 
Dunnock. The dunnock is a generalist that will breed in any hedgerow or dense scrub. The Survey 
Site had one confirmed, 11 probable and two possible breeding pairs. 
4.15 
Gadwall. The Gadwall strongly prefers fairly shallow, eutrophic or standing open water, with plenty 
of cover from emergent vegetation and dry banks or islands for nesting (Snow and Perrins, 1998; 
RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had one possible breeding pair in the pools to the north 
of the Survey Site. Water is being pumped away from the area of pooled water in the clay pit within 
the Project Site to promote the implementation of the LLRS. The Project Site, or indeed, the Survey 
Site is unlikely to support suitable habitat for Gadwall by 2015. 
4.16 
Green woodpecker. The green woodpecker’s favoured habitat is woodland edge, but will breed in 
any suitable mature tree (Snow and Perrins, 1998). The Survey Site had one possible breeding 
pair near the Bletchley to Bedford railway to the north east of the Survey Site 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

26/08/2014 
4.17 
Grey partridge. Grey partridge prefers short grassland (not longer than 15 cm) with patches of 
scrub or hedgerows for them to nest at the base of and to provide cover (Snow and Perrins, 1998). 
There were one probable and one possible breeding pair spread across the Survey Site. 
4.18 
House sparrow. The house sparrow is a species that nests in loose colonies often utilising holes 
and crevices within buildings, but will also nest within dense hedgerows which is a very common 
habitat at the Survey Site. The Survey Site had three probable breeding pairs near the buildings on 
the western boundary. 
4.19 
Kestrel. There was a single pair breeding within the Survey Site but these were only seen foraging 
with no evidence of breeding within the Survey Site.        
4.20 
Lapwing. Lapwings breed on lowland farmland and unimproved pasture and meadows (RSPB, 
2014). The Survey Site had three confirmed and two probable breeding pairs concentrated in the 
southern clay pit to the north of the Survey Site. 
4.21 
Linnet. The linnet is a generalist, found where there are abundant sources of seed (typically 
associated with lowland farmland). It will nest in dense, thorny hedgerows or areas of scrub. There 
were seven probable and three possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
4.22 
Little grebe. The little grebe prefers small shallow water bodies (less than 1m), with muddy bottoms 
and a dense submerged aquatic vegetation. One probable pair was breeding in the pool within the 
southern clay pit. 
4.23 
Mallard. The mallard is extremely adaptable to a wide range of habitats, but essentially prefers still 
and shallow water (less than 1m) with ample plant growth such as the small ponds around the site 
(Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had one probable pair in a 
pond to the east of the railway and a second possible breeding pair in the lake margin in the clay 
pit. 
4.24 
Mistle thrush. The mistle thrush is a generalist species which breeds in a variety of habitats 
including gardens and farmland (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey 
Site had two probable breeding pairs in the woodland to the west. 
4.25 
Pochard. The pochard requires several hectares of shallow (1 - 2.5 m) of open water, uncluttered 
with floating vegetation but prolific with submerged plant and animal food (Snow and Perrins, 
1998). Two to three pairs were potentially breeding within the lake, beyond the Survey Site. The 
small pools being drained that are found within the Project Site (southern clay pit) are not large 
enough to support breeding pochard. 
4.26 
Redshank. The inland breeding habitat of redshank is limited to depressions, lakes and river 
basins, and other wetlands free of tall dense aquatic vegetation or closed stands of shrubs and 
trees (Snow and Perrins, 1998). A small flock was heard on visit 1, estimated to be approximately 
10 birds. Two pairs probably breeding were recorded within the Survey Site. Outside the Survey 
Site (but within the southern clay pit) a pair was confirmed breeding by the presence of young, and 
another pair probably breeding was recorded. 
4.27 
Reed bunting. The breeding habitat of reed bunting is restricted to low, dense vegetation, such as 
the reed beds and oilseed rape fields across the Survey Site. They will avoid open country as well 
as closed forests. (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). There were three confirmed 
and three possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
4.28 
Ringed plover. Ringed plover breeding habitat is limited to wide sandy or shingle lake margins 
(Snow and Perrins, 1998). One pair was probably breeding and two possibly breeding within the 
southern clay pit in the north of the Survey Site. 
4.29 
Skylark. Skylarks are ground nesting birds preferring open surfaces of firm, level or unobstructed 
soils preferably well clothed in grasses or cereals (Snow & Perrins, 1998). There were nine 
probable and one possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site.

4.30 
Song thrush. The song thrush is a generalist species that will nest in any suitable cover including 
scrub or hedgerows (Snow & Perrins, 1998). The Survey Site supported one confirmed, three 
probable and one possible breeding pairs. 
4.31 
Stock dove. The stock dove is a generalist species that nests in holes in trees, buildings and 
sometimes in abandoned rabbit warrens (Snow & Perrins, 1998). There were three probable 
breeding pairs in the small wooded copses across the Survey Site. 
4.32 
Barn Swallow. Swallows were not recorded breeding on the Survey Site, but more than three pairs 
were recorded within the farm buildings just beyond the Survey Site and were using the Survey 
Site to forage. 
4.33 
Tufted duck. The tufted duck is extremely adaptable to a wide range of water habitats, but prefer 
more open freshwater habitats not encroached by vegetation (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 
2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had two probable breeding pairs on the pools being drained at 
the southern clay pit. 
4.34 
Turtle dove. The turtle dove prefers undisturbed habitat and will not breed in or very near towns. 
Although it is predominantly a ground feeder they are largely arboreal and will breed in small trees, 
shrubs or tall mature hedges (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). On the Survey 
Site a singing male was observed singing to the south end of the access track (northern part of the 
Survey Site), meaning a probable pair. 
4.35 
Whitethroat. Whitethroat is a generalist species that requires dense scrub or hedgerows for 
nesting. There were two confirmed and 16 probable breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
4.36 
Willow warbler. Willow warbler is a generalist species that requires scrub, hedgerows or woodland 
but nests within the dense vegetation at the base of these features (Snow & Perrins, 1998). The 
Survey Site had six probable breeding pairs mainly around the scrub adjacent to the railway 
corridors. 
4.37 
Yellow wagtail. In the breeding season yellow wagtail is confined to lowlands, occupying fringes of 
wetlands, such as rivers, lakesides and moist pastures (Snow and Perrins, 1998). It is a ground 
nesting bird using dense vegetation such as the reedbed on and adjacent to the Survey Site. 
Although there was potential for breeding on site no evidence was found. There was a single pair 
possibly breeding to the north east, beyond the Survey Site. 
4.38 
Yellowhammer. Yellowhammer is found on a wide variety of farmland types but is most common on 
lowland arable farmland. It nests at the base of dense hedgerows (occasionally on the ground 
earlier in the season) (Snow and Perrins, 1998). There were two confirmed, eight probable and two 
possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
Distribution and abundance of Breeding Birds using the Survey Site 
4.39 
A total of 65 bird species were recorded breeding within the Survey Site, 31 of these appear on one 
or more schedules or lists of species of conservation importance. 
4.40 
The majority of the Survey Site is of limited value for breeding birds with large arable fields, 
delineated by hedgerows and ditches. The majority of the species are generalist species, breeding 
within the hedgerows, scrub and small wooded copses within the Survey Site with only skylark 
recorded breeding in the open fields. 
4.41 
The main interest feature within the Survey Site for breeding birds is the Rookery Clay Pits CWS. 
The southern half of this clay pit that lies within the Project Site presently includes sparsely 
vegetated ground, reedbed and bare earth. This southern clay pit is presently being restored as 
part of a LLRS by the landowner, so will have little value to the majority of the breeding birds 
observed here by the end of 2014. The northern clay pit, which is outside the Survey Site also 
includes reedbed habitat, but this is healthier and is found in association with open water. 
Accordingly, it is suitable for a more diverse range of breeding birds, which included a male 
booming bittern, bearded tit and pochard.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a suite of mammal surveys, specifically badger, 
bats, otter and water vole, in habitats within and adjacent to the red-line boundary of the Project 
Site as reported in the Project Scoping Report (the ‘Survey Site’). The purpose of the surveys was 
to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. A 
supporting desk study and literature review was also conducted, which covered the Project Site 
and land up to 2 km from this. 
1.3 
The desk study revealed the presence badger, otter and water vole activity around The Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS and roosting bats in buildings at South Pillinge Farm. 
1.4 
The badger survey identified the presence of a 6-entrance main / subsidiary badger sett within the 
Project Site. 
1.5 
Evidence of bat activity was widely recorded across the Project Site; however, the access track to 
the north of the Project Site returned the highest number of records, primarily from the automated 
detector surveys. Several small, non-breeding summer roosts of common and soprano pipistrelle 
bats and brown long-eared bat were identified at South Pillinge Farm. 
1.6 
No evidence of otter or water activity was found within the Project Site.  
1.7 
This report is an interim report. The results of the badger, water vole and otter surveys are 
complete. However a final bat activity survey is programmed for September 2014.  A final report 
will be produced to incorporate these findings, which will accompany the DCO Application.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, in which the Project would be located, comprises land within former clay pits 
known as ‘The Rookery’, and the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into 
the surrounding agricultural land. The approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 
501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site for the badger survey comprised the red-line boundary of the Project Site as 
reported in the Project Scoping Report (see Figure 1).  The Survey Site for the otter and water vole 
survey included all watercourses or ditches within the Project Site (see Figure 5). The Survey Site 
for the bat surveys included the red-line boundary of the Project Site, extended to include South 
Pillinge Farm, located close to the north western boundary of the Project Site (see Figures 2a and 
2b and Figure 3). The main habitats within the Survey Site are arable fields with boundaries 
delineated by hedgerows, ditches, minor roads and lanes.. The main habitats within the Survey 
Site are arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the north, 
an area of land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration 
Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. This area presently includes sparsely vegetated ground, swamp 
and bare earth. Towards the end of 2014 it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk 
movement of soils that are required for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including mammal (badger, bat, otter and water vole) surveys. These baseline 
surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, 
which will be submitted, as an integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the mammal surveys were to identify whether protected or noteworthy1 mammal 
species, specifically badger, bats, otter and water vole, are present within the Survey Site, and 
where present, to obtain an understanding of abundance and distribution.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected and notable species was requested from the 
Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering the Project 
Site and land up to 2 km from the Project Site boundary. This information was supplemented by 
previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, 
including land within and immediately north of the Survey Site (PBA, 2009; BSG Ecology 2013). 
Badgers 
3.2 
A dedicated badger survey was conducted by Greg Chamberlain and Dr Jim Fairclough on 30 July 
2014.  Where possible all areas of the Survey Site (see Figure 1, Appendix 1) were accessed. The 
survey involved walking over the Survey Site, searching for evidence of badgers and badger 
activity. Evidence searched for included sett entrances, latrine pits, foraging holes, paw prints, 
pathways in vegetation and badger hairs caught on fencing or vegetation. The dedicated survey 
conducted on 30 July 2014 was also supplemented with incidental records, taken during other 
species surveys (e.g. reptile surveys) conducted on a number of occasions in 2014. 
3.3 
Once a sett was discovered, an indication of the level of activity (following Neal and Cheeseman, 
1996) was also made, as follows: 
 
Active – active sett entrances contain no debris or vegetation, are obviously regularly used 
and often show signs of having been recently excavated. 
 
Partially used – partially used entrances are those not in regular use, and which may have 
debris (leaf litter, twigs, moss, etc.) around the entrance.  However, they could potentially be 
used regularly in the future with minimal clearance necessary. 
 
Disused – disused sett entrances show signs of not having been used for a considerable 
period of time and would not be used again without extensive clearance by a badger.    
3.4 
Several categories of badger setts have been identified (Neal and Cheeseman, 1996). These are 
described as follows: 
 
Main setts are defined as setts with five or more entrance holes and which show evidence of 
use throughout the year. Main setts are associated with large spoil heaps and well-trodden 
paths.  
 
Annexe setts – These setts are intermediate-sized and may be used by breeding badgers.  
These setts are normally close to a main sett (within 150 m of the main sett and connected to 
it by obvious paths). 
 
Subsidiary setts – These are similar to annexe setts but are likely to be further away (at least 
150 m from the main sett and not as well connected to the main sett as annexe setts).  
 
Outlier setts – Outlier setts are small setts with one or two entrance holes which are used 
sporadically by badgers as a temporary refuge.  There may be several outlier setts within one 
badger social group’s territory.   
3.5 
In addition to badger setts, other evidence of badgers was also recorded. This included:   
 
live or dead badgers; 
 
foraging scrapes (distinctive excavations made by badgers when searching for food); 
 
badger dung; 
 
dung pits (a badger will often deposit its dung within a small excavated pit); 
 
latrines (a collection of dung pits); 
 
badger guard hairs; 
 
pathways; and 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

13/08/2014 
 
badger tracks (footprints). 
Limitations to Methods 
3.6 
For health and safety reasons it was not possible to access Bletchley to Bedford rail land to check 
for badger activity close to the railway line. It is not thought that this presents a significant 
constraint, as likely presence of badgers could be confirmed through evidence such as large spoil 
heaps, latrines and pathways adjacent to (or beneath) the railway boundary fence. 
Bats 
3.7 
The arable habitats covering the majority of the Project Site are considered to provide limited 
foraging opportunities for bats; however, the hedgerows, wooded copses and ditches were 
identified as being likely to provide a suitable commuting and foraging resource for bats in the 
wider landscape. Overall, the Survey Site has been assessed as being of ‘Low Habitat Quality’ 
according to the current best practice bat survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Therefore a range of 
methods were used at the appropriate level of survey effort as recommended by the guidelines: 
 
Walked transects; and  
 
Automated detector surveys.   
3.8 
In addition, buildings at South Pillinge Farm were surveyed for presence / likely absence of bats, 
and where present, to characterise the type of roost (e.g. number and species of bat using the 
roost). The following methods were used: 
 
Internal and external building inspection; and 
 
Dusk emergence and pre-dawn re-entry roost surveys. 
Bat Activity Surveys 
Walked transects 
3.9 
Seasonal walked surveys of two pre-determined transect routes (northern and southern) were 
undertaken in May (spring) and July (summer) 2014. The final (autumn) walked survey will be 
completed in September.  
3.10 
Each transect started 15 minutes before sunset and took approximately 2-3 hours to complete. The 
timing of the surveys therefore covers the bat emergence period and the period of most intense 
foraging activity when invertebrate prey is most abundant (Altringham, 2003).   
3.11 
The same transect route was walked on each survey visit with the start points and direction 
changed on each visit to ensure that different parts of the Survey Site were surveyed at different 
times of the night. This approach was adopted to remove any bias that could be introduced into the 
survey data if each transect was walked in the same direction. This bias could otherwise have 
resulted in any given point on the transect route being visited at approximately the same interval 
after sunset.  Static recording points were selected for each of the transects.  At these points the 
surveyor stood for 3 minutes to listen and record all bat passes, using bat detectors. 
3.12 
Bat activity was recorded using Anabat hand-held electronic bat detectors. This model of detector 
automatically records all the bat passes they detect, which significantly reduces the chances that 
bats could be missed due to human error. Wherever possible, surveyors recorded the observed 
behaviour and numbers of bats onto a field proforma. This was to aid identification and also to 
provide additional detail on the behaviour of observed bats. Field notes included a record of the 
time of each bat encounter, allowing results to be cross-referenced with the recorded data. 
3.13 
Details of the walked transect surveys are summarised in Table 1. A map of walked transect routes 
is presented in Figures 2a and 2b (Appendix 1). The main aim of the transect walks was to 
determine the location of areas of high bat activity, such as foraging areas and/or commuting 
routes (e.g. ditches and hedgerows). Accordingly, the selected transect routes focussed on such 
areas.

All walked transects avoided heavy rain, strong winds and dusk temperatures below 10oC as 
recommended in the BCT guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Dates of the survey visits along with survey 
timings and weather conditions are provided in Table 2. Surveys were undertaken by Dr Tom Flynn 
(TF) MCIEEM, Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, John Woods (JW) Grad CIEEM, Tom 
Chapman (TC), Stuart Elsom (SE) and Ross Crates (RC) (Table 1). (Note that the third and final survey 
visit is yet to be undertaken).

Automated detector surveys 
3.15 
In addition to the transect surveys, automated detector surveys were conducted using Wildlife 
Acoustics Song Meter 2 (SM2) bat detectors. These detectors are also full spectrum detectors that 
are triggered automatically to record bat echolocation calls.  These detectors can be deployed and 
left to remotely record bat activity for a period of several nights. 
3.16 
Two SM2 detectors (Statics 1 and 2) were deployed, to assess bat activity along the vehicular track 
in the north west of the Project Site and a section of scattered scrub approximately 100 m to the 
east of South Pillinge Farm, to supplement data from the transect surveys. The locations of Statics 
1 and 2 are shown on Figure 2a (Appendix 1). 
3.17 
The detectors were deployed for at least four consecutive nights at each of the locations, which 
allowed continuous monitoring to take place during the period when bats are active, i.e. sunset to 
sunrise. They were programmed to begin recording from half an hour before sunset until half an 
hour after sunrise.  Survey hours varied throughout the survey season according to daylight hours 
and have been calculated for each recording session in order to accurately calculate activity 
indices.  
3.18 
The automated detectors were deployed for the following dates: 30 May to 4 June 2014 and 22 to 
30 July 2014. Statics 1 and 2 will be deployed for at least four consecutive nights in September 
2014.   
Bat call analysis 
3.19 
Recorded bat calls were analysed using Analook software to confirm the identity of the bats 
present. Where possible, the bat was identified to species level. Records of long-eared bats 
Plecotus sp. were not identified to species level due to the overlapping call parameters of the two 
native species but were assumed to refer to brown long-eared bats. It is possible that grey long-
eared bat Plecotus austriacus may occasionally occur in the region, but given the species’ known 
distribution (Swift & Entwistle 2008), it is highly unlikely. In addition, no records of this species were 
found from the desk study. Species of the genus Myotis were grouped together due to many of the 
species having overlapping call parameters making species identification problematic (Hundt, 
2012).  
3.20 
For Pipistrellus species the following criteria, based on measurements of peak frequency, were 
used to classify calls: 
 
Common pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥42 and <49 kHz 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

 
Soprano pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥51 kHz 


<39 kHz  
 
Common pipistrelle / soprano pipistrelle 
 
≥49 and <51 kHz 
 
Common pipistrelle / Nathusius’ pipistrelle  
≥39 and <42 kHz 
3.21 
In addition, the following categories were used for calls which could not be identified with 
confidence due to the overlap in call characteristics between species or species groups: 
 
Myotis sp./brown long-eared bat;  
 
Nyctalus sp. (either Leisler’s bat or noctule); and 
 
Eptesicus/Nyctalus sp. (either serotine, noctule or Leisler's bat).  
3.22 
The Analook software enables analysis of the relative activity of different species of bats by 
counting the minimum number of bats recorded within discrete sound files. For the purposes of this 
analysis, the recording of one or more passes by a single species of bat within a 15 second sound 
file is counted as a single bat pass (B). During analysis of sound files, it was possible to estimate 
the minimum number of bats recorded on individual sound files but not whether consecutive sound 
files had recorded, for example, a number of individual bats passing as they commute to a feeding 
habitat or one bat calling repeatedly as it flies up and down a hedgerow, for instance. Therefore, 
relative abundance of bats cannot be estimated from this analysis, but the number of bat passes 
does reflect the relative importance of a feature/habitat to bats by assigning a level of bat activity 
that is associated with that feature, regardless of the type of activity. In this analysis, bat passes 
per hour (B/h) has been used as a measure of ‘relative activity’.  
3.23 
Following completion of the autumn survey, scheduled for September, data will be further analysed 
to incorporate an assessment of seasonal patterns in bat activity. 
Limitations to methods 
3.24 
The aim of automated detector monitoring was to collect at least 4 nights of data in each season 
(spring, summer and autumn). However, during the summer survey in July the SM2 unit located at 
static position 2 (S2) failed during the third night of monitoring. Given that the measure of ‘relative 
activity’ used in this analysis is bat passes per hour, it was still possible to extract useful data, albeit 
based on a reduced sample size. This is therefore not considered a significant constraint. 
Roost Surveys 
Internal and external building Inspection 
3.25 
On 19 May 2014 an internal and external building inspection survey was undertaken at South 
Pillinge Farm by Laura Grant (Natural England Bat Licence no. CLS001496). Ten buildings 
(Buildings B1 – B10) (see Figure 3, Appendix 1) were inspected to assess their potential to support 
roosting bats and to search for evidence of bat activity. 
3.26 
During the survey a thorough search was made of the buildings including all accessible areas and 
crevices for bats, their droppings, food remains or characteristic grease marks at potential roost 
exit/entrance points.  The exterior of the buildings were searched, paying particular attention to 
window ledges, where droppings can gather undisturbed, and under potential roost access points, 
such as loose tiles and gaps between boarding. Where possible, internal inspections were also 
undertaken.   
3.27 
Signs of bat activity searched for included: 
 
Live bats; 
 
Droppings; 
 
Urine spots; 
 
Feeding remains (e.g. discarded wings of flying invertebrates); 
 
Oil staining;

 
Smell; 
 
Daytime vocalisations; 
 
Absence of cobwebs (a well-used bat roost and its access points are typically clear of 
cobwebs); 
 
Scratching; 
 
Dead bats; and 
 
Tracks in dust (by a roost). 
3.28 
All buildings were assigned a category defining their potential to support roosting bats in 
accordance with Table 2 below. 
Table 2: Categories of bat potential of buildings 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
Negligible  
Building with no or very limited roosting opportunities for bats, no 
evidence of use by bats and where the feature is isolated from foraging 
habitat. 
Low  
Building with a limited number of roosting opportunities, no evidence of 
current use by bats and with poor connectivity to foraging habitat. 
Medium  
Building with some roosting opportunities, with no evidence of current 
use by bats and with connectivity to moderate – high quality foraging 
habitat. 
High  
Building with multiple roosting opportunities for one or more species of 
bat, and with good connectivity to high quality foraging habitat. 
Confirmed Roost 
Presence of bats or evidence of recent use by bats. 
Bat emergence and re-entry surveys 
3.29 
In order to establish the presence/likely absence of bat roosts within the buildings, and to establish 
the species and number of bats using the buildings, one dusk emergence and one pre-dawn re-
entry survey was undertaken. These surveys covered those buildings where either a bat roost had 
been found or where the building was assessed as having medium or high potential to support 
roosting bats. Surveys involve ecologists watching and listening for bats leaving their roosts at dusk 
(emerging) and / or returning to a roost pre-dawn (re-entry). 
3.30 
From the inspection survey two buildings were found to contain bat roosts / have high potential to 
support bat roosts and three buildings were deemed to have medium potential to support roosting 
bats. In order to adequately survey these five buildings, eight surveyors were utilised for the 
surveys. Surveyors were positioned outside the buildings at points where potential bat access 
points could be observed. 
3.31 
Surveyors were equipped with an Anabat bat detector to enable the bat calls to be recorded to 
assist with species identification. The recorded calls were then analysed using Analook sonogram 
software. 
3.32 
Dates of the survey visits along with survey timings and weather conditions are provided in Table 3. 
Surveys were led by Laura Grant (LG) (Natural England Bat Licence no. CLS001496) and Hannah 
Bilston (HB) (Natural England Bat Licence no. CLS00548). The survey team comprised Dr Jim 
Fairclough (JF) MCIEEM, Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, John Woods (JW) Grad CIEEM, 
Tom Chapman (TC), Stuart Elsom (SE), Francesca Morini (FM), David Kent (DK), Glyn Brown

Limitations to Methods 
3.33 
During the pre-dawn re-entry survey on 23 July 2014, one Anabat failed. As a result, one surveyor 
(Laura Grant, positioned at VP2) used a BatBox Duet detector and, in the absence of a recording 
device, undertook species identification in the field. Laura Grant is a highly experienced, licenced 
bat worker, skilled in species identification. As such, an absence of bat call recordings is not 
considered a significant constraint. 
Otter and Water Vole 
Otter and water vole survey 
3.34 
An otter and water vole survey was undertaken at the site on 19 May 2014, which coincides with 
the spring peak levels of activity for water vole (Strachan et al., 2011). The survey was undertaken 
by Dr Jim Fairclough MCIEEM, assisted by Greg Chamberlain MCIEEM and John Woods 
GradCIEEM. The weather during the survey was dry, with intermittent sun and a light wind. 
3.35 
Ditches present across the Survey Site were surveyed for water vole and otter. This included an 
assessment of the suitability of each section of ditch for water vole. The survey covered 
approximately 2.3 km of ditch, as shown on Figure 5 (Appendix 1). Each ditch was searched for 
evidence of water vole following best practice guidance provided in the Water Vole Conservation 
Handbook (Strachan et al., 2011). This included visual searches for the following signs: 
 
Latrines - comprising a concentration of droppings in discrete locations, often near nest sites, 
at range boundaries or at places used to enter and exit the water; 
 
Feeding stations - comprising neat piles of chewed lengths of vegetation, usually up to 10 cm 
in length, on pathways or haul-out locations; 
 
Burrows - these are typically found along the water’s edge and on top of the bank (up to 5 m 
from the water’s edge) and are 4-8 cm in diameter. Holes on top of the banks often have 
‘lawns’ around them (areas of grazed vegetation); and 
 
Footprints - located in soft mud or silt. 
3.36 
In addition, any evidence of otter, such as droppings (‘spraints’), runs, holts and footprints, was 
recorded. 
3.37 
One section of ditch within the Survey Site, north west of Ditch 2b (see Figure 5, Appendix 1), was 
not surveyed during the present (2014) surveys. This is due to the ditch being within the area being 
restored as part of the LLRS. Water vole was not recorded as being present in this ditch section 
during surveys completed in 2008 and 2009 (PBA, 2009). 
Other Notable Mammal Species 
3.38 
During surveys targeted at other species, incidental observations of other notable mammal species 
of principal importance (s. 41; NERC Act 2006) were recorded.

Results and Interpretation 
Badger 
Desk study 
4.1 
BSG Ecology undertook badger surveys in September 2008 (PBA, 2009). These surveys identified 
the presence of badger latrines within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS; however, no evidence of badger 
setts were identified. 
4.2 
A foraging badger was noted within scrub between the northern and southern halves of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS approximately 500 m to the east of the proposed access track, during great 
crested newt surveys of Rookery North Pit in 2013 (BSG Ecology, 2013).  
Badger survey 
4.3 
An active badger sett comprising six well-used entrances was identified within a small copse within 
the Survey Site, as shown on confidential Figure 1, Appendix 1. Given the absence of other badger 
setts within the Survey Site, this is likely to be a main or subsidiary sett. Mammal tracks of 
indeterminable origin, and therefore possibly attributable to badger, and two atypical latrines 
(probably badger) were also identified within the Survey Site, as shown on confidential Figure 1, 
Appendix 1. 
Bats 
Desk study 
4.4 
In 2008, BSG Ecology undertook activity surveys, building and tree inspection surveys and dusk 
emergence/dawn return to roost surveys for bats at The Rookery Clay Pit CWS and the 
surrounding area (PBA, 2009).  The activity surveys recorded an assemblage of eight species of 
bat foraging and/or commuting within and around the northern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
These species included common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
pygmaeus and Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii; noctule Nyctalus noctula; serotine 
Eptesicus serotinus; barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus; Leisler’s bats Nyctalus leisleri and a 
Myotis spp. Buildings at South Pillinge Farm were also assessed to determine the presence / likely 
absence of roosting bats. 
4.5 
Of the buildings that were surveyed, five were found to contain evidence of the presence of bats. 
The farmhouse was found to support a brown long-eared Plecotus auritus roost in the loft. A small 
number of bats were seen during the survey, and droppings were found that were thought to be 
from this species only (PBA, 2008). 
4.6 
The desk study (BRMC) also provided records of nine species of bats from within a 2 km radius of 
the Survey Site. The closest of these were a noctule bat found on a tree 150 m to the west of the 
Survey Site in 2012 and a Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii from 300 m to the west in 2009. 
Walked transects 
4.7 
A least five bat species were recorded during the walked transect surveys (walked transects) 
undertaken to date. The confirmed species or species groups include: 
 
Myotis spp.; 
 
Noctule;  
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle;  
 
Common pipistrelle; and 
 
Soprano pipistrelle.

The northern transect focussed on the access track that runs along the western edge of The 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS, the wet ditch and plantation edge to the south of The Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS, South Pillinge Farm and an area of plantation woodland to the south of this (Figure 2a, 
Appendix 1). The southern transect focused on field margins and hedgerows within the central 
section of the Project Site (Figure 1b, Appendix 1). Relative activity levels were similar on both 
transects. 
4.10 
During the transect surveys, common and soprano pipistrelle bats were the most frequently 
recorded bat species accounting for 43.3% and 38% of all the bat calls recorded respectively. 
These were encountered commuting across the Project Site and foraging along hedgerows and 
plantation woodland edges.  Five Nathusius’ pipistrelle calls were recorded, all of which were 
detected on the northern transect in July near South Pillinge Farm and near the northernmost point 
of the Project Site. 
4.11 
Calls of species other than pipistrelles were only recorded in very low numbers during the walked 
transect surveys.  The patterns of activity of these species recorded during the static monitoring are 
discussed in the following paragraphs. 
4.12 
Noctule were recorded in May and July and account for 10.7% of all recorded calls. Most of the 
noctule calls were recorded in July, these were bats commuting over the site. 
4.13 
Myotis species were also recorded in May and July, with 3 and 4 calls recorded respectively, 
accounting for 4.7% of the total calls recorded. Myotis calls were encountered scattered in pockets 
throughout the Survey Site including along the access track to the west of The Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS, near the woodland plantation to the south of The Rookery Clay Pit CWS and near South 
Pillinge Farm. 
4.14 
Most of the species were recorded outside typical roost emergence times (see Table 5, below). 
Some Myotis species calls during the July transect were recorded before 70 minutes after sunset 
which is within the typical emergence period for this species group (typically between 30 and 70 
minutes after sunset) indicating the species may be roosting within or near to the Survey Site 
(Hundt, 2012).

Automated detector surveys 
4.15 
The two static bat detectors were deployed in the following locations across the Survey Site as 
shown on Figure 2a, Appendix 1:  
 
Static (S) S1 on a section of scattered scrub approximately 100 m to the east of South Pillinge 
Farm; 
 
Static (S) S2 on the vehicular track in the north west of the Project Site. 
4.16 
A total of at least nine bat species were recorded during the periods of static detector monitoring. 
These species were as follows: 
 
Barbastelle; 
 
Long-eared species; 
 
Myotis spp.; 
 
Noctule; 
 
Leisler’s; 
 
Serotine; 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
 
Common pipistrelle; and 
 
Soprano pipistrelle.

As with the transect survey findings, the static monitoring survey data clearly show that common 
and soprano pipistrelle bats were the bat species most frequently recorded, accounting for 7,488 
(2,300 – common pipistrelle, 4,969 – soprano pipistrelle and 219 either common or soprano 
pipistrelle) out of 7,918 bat calls from the static detectors combined, which equates to over 94% of 
the total bat calls recorded during automated detector surveys at the north of the Survey Site. 
4.19 
Myotis species were the second most frequent bat species/groups recorded during static 
monitoring. However, compared with the common pipistrelle, the level of activity recorded by static 
detectors was much lower with an overall total of 273 calls accounting for 3.4% of the total activity.  
4.20 
The next most frequently recorded species were noctule, barbastelle and long-eared bat sp. with a 
total of 85, 19 and 15 calls recorded across the whole monitoring period accounting for 1.1%, 
0.24% and 0.19% respectively of all calls recorded during the static surveys.  Noctule bats and 
possibly long-eared (only long-eared species calls with parameters overlapping with serotine and 
Myotis sp. bats were recorded during the May period) were recorded in all months, albeit in low 
numbers. Barbastelle were only recorded during the May survey period. 
4.21 
Bat activity was significantly higher at S2 than at S1. During the May survey period, bat passes (of 
all species) occurred at a rate of 221.39 passes per hour at S2, whereas as no passes were 
recorded at S1. During the July survey period, whilst overall bat activity was lower than in May, 
activity levels at static location 2 (47.97 passes per hour) were again higher than at S1 (10.91). 
This is largely due to significantly higher common and soprano pipistrelle bat activity at the S2 than 
S1. 
Internal and external building inspection  
4.22 
The assessment of roosting potential for each of the buildings located at South Pillinge Farm is 
shown in Figure 3, Appendix 1.  The findings of the external, and where applicable internal 
inspection, are described in Table 7 below. 
4.23 
Two buildings (Buildings B5 and B6) were assessed as offering high potential to support roosting 
bats due to multiple roosting opportunities and immediate connectivity with suitable foraging 
habitat. Buildings B5 and B6 both contained evidence of use by bats.  Building B5 offers a large 
number of external roosting opportunities and access to open internal roof structures.  Building B6 
offers external roosting opportunities and potential access to an internal roost space. Whilst no 
internal inspection was undertaken in Building B6, the desk study revealed that a brown long-eared 
bat roost was present in the loft (PBA, 2009). Discussion with the farmer indicated that, at the time 
of survey, this roost was still present. 
4.24 
Three buildings (Buildings B3, B8 and B10) were assessed as offering a medium potential to 
support roosting bats due to several roosting opportunities and immediate connectivity with suitable 
foraging habitat. A further four buildings were assessed as offering a low potential to support 
roosting bats due to a limited number of features suitable for roosting bats (Buildings B1, B2, B4 
and B7). 
4.25 
One building (Building B9) was assessed as offering negligible potential to support roosting bats 
due to a lack of features capable of supporting roosting bat.

Bat emergence and re-entry surveys 
4.26 
During the emergence / re-entry surveys undertaken at South Pillinge Farm, bats were observed 
emerging from or re-entering to roost within three of the buildings, Buildings B5, B6 and B8. No 
other buildings were found to support roosting bats. Survey findings are described below and likely 
roost access points are shown on Figure 4, Appendix 1. 
Building B5 
4.27 
During the re-entry survey on 23 July 2014, a soprano pipistrelle bat was observed re-entering a 
roost, accessed through a gap between bricks where a piece of mortar was missing in the western 
wall, at 04.41 (29 minutes before sunrise). In addition a pipistrelle species bat was observed re-
entering a roost within the western elevation of the building at 04.35, 35 minutes before sunrise. 
Later inspection of the wall revealed the probable roost access point to be a clean gap in the corner 
of a damaged brick. 
4.28 
On 30 July, during the emergence survey, a pipistrelle species bat exited the building at 21.27, 31 
minutes after sunrise, from the northern-most window on the western elevation of the building. This 
bat is likely to have been roosting in an internal building feature. Also at 21.27, a common 
pipistrelle bat was observed as having emerged from beneath a ridge tile located in the extension 
to the south side of the central (of three) courtyard area. Two minutes later a common pipistrelle 
bat exited the central section of building B5 through the barn door, having likely emerged from a 
roost located within the building’s interior. 
4.29 
A brown long-eared bat returned to roost at 04.22 on 23 July 2014, 48 minutes before sunrise, 
within the northern end of the building via an access point (slots in a partially covered window 
space) located near the northern end of the western wall.  Prior to this, a Myotis sp. bat was seen 
flying towards the north west corner of the building at roof height at 04.04, 66 minutes before 
sunrise. Given the direction of flight and proximity to sunrise, it is possible that this Myotis sp. bat 
re-entered a roost 
4.30 
These findings indicate that Building B5 supports a number of small, non-breeding summer roosts 
of common and soprano pipistrelle bats, a brown long-eared bat and possibly a Myotis sp. bat. 
Building B6 
4.31 
During the re-entry survey a common pipistrelle bat re-entered a roost, accessed under a loose 
roof tile, at 04.39, 31 minutes before sunrise. During the emergence survey a pipistrelle species bat 
and a soprano pipistelle bat emerged from under loose tiles. The pipistrelle species bat emerged at 
21.09, 13 minutes after sunset, from a roost exit point located near the roof apex near the eastern 
side of the building. At 21.30, 34 minutes after sunset, a soprano pipistrelle bat emerged from a 
roost exit point located on the western side of the roof. 
4.32 
Four brown long-eared bats were observed flying close to the roof of Building B6 during the re-
entry survey between 04.35 and 04.39, 35 – 31 minutes before sunrise. Given the proximity of 
these observations to sunrise and of the flights to the roof, it is probable that these long-eared bats 
re-entered the farmhouse to roost via access points in the roof. During the emergence survey, a 
long-eared bat is likely to have emerged from an access point located in the roof on the western 
side of the building at 21.25, 29 minutes after sunset.  
4.33 
These findings indicate that the Building B6 supports a number of small, non-breeding summer 
roosts of common and soprano pipistrelle bats and for brown long-eared bats. 
Building B8 
4.34 
Two pipistrelle species bats re-entered a roost between 04.35 and 04.37, 35 – 33 minutes before 
sunrise. Access was gained via a slot behind a barge board on the western elevation.  
4.35 
These findings indicate that Building B8 supports a non-breeding summer roost for a pipistrelle bat 
species.

Otter and water vole 
Desk study 
Water vole 
4.36 
The survey carried out by BSG Ecology in October 2008 identified the presence of a water vole 
latrine, a large feeding cache and several runs (PBA, 2009). These signs were found on the 
northern fringe of the largest waterbody in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS and provide direct evidence 
of water voles presence in close proximity to the Survey Site. No signs of water vole activity were 
found during a subsequent survey carried out in May 2009 (PBA, 2009).  During this survey, areas 
of vegetation were located that had been disturbed by wildfowl, in particular geese, and deer.  
There were also frequent signs of fox activity and possible signs of mink presence. The closest 
most recent record of water vole in the desk study was from 1.5 km to the north of the Survey Site 
in 2012. 
Otter 
4.37 
During surveys undertaken in 2008 a single otter print was recorded on a clay bank in the south-
east of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (PBA, 2009). No other evidence of otter activity was recorded 
during the survey. The large water-body in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the 
proposed access) supports a healthy fish population and it is likely that otters regularly use this 
water-body and the adjacent Stewartby Lake CWS as a foraging resource. 
Otter and water vole survey  
4.38 
No evidence of water vole presence was found. Ditches within the Survey Site, as shown on Figure 
5 (Appendix 1) and summarised in Table 8, below, had poor to sub-optimal habitat suitability for 
water vole.

heavily shaded on west side with mature Lombardy poplar. 
Common nettle dominates both banks. Bank vegetation also 
includes frequent great willowherb and occasional hogweed. Poor 
suitability, in most part due to lack of forage and shallow depth. 
Poor 
4.39 
No evidence of otter presence was found. There are few foraging opportunities for otter within the 
Survey Site, which supports generally intensively managed habitats with few places that otters 
could use as resting sites. The only exception would be along the access road (northern part of the 
Survey Site, adjacent to the large water-filled lagoon of Rookery Clat Pit CWS (northern lagoon). It 
is also relevant that ditches within the Survey Site have limited connectivity to suitable habitats in 
the wider area. 
Other protected and notable mammal species 
4.40 
Records for all of the following species have been revealed during the desk study, and are listed as 
Species of Principal Importance on s. 41 of the NERC Act 2006. During the surveys conducted in 
2014 surveyors were vigilant to the potential presence of these species across the Survey Site. 
Accordingly, when any of these animals (or evidence of the presence of an animal) was seen a 
record was duly made, the results of which are annotated on Figure 6 (Appendix 1). 
Brown hare 
4.41 
Three brown hare Lepus europaeus were recorded on site during an initial walkover survey of the 
Project Site (BSG Ecology, 2014). 
4.42 
During the targeted surveys in spring and summer 2014, a further nine records of brown hare were 
made within the Project Site, and one approximately 100 m to the south. These records were made 
over four different survey visits: 17 April (5 observations), 14 May (1 observation), 19 May (1 
observation) and 30 July (3 observations). 
4.43 
This species is common and widespread in the UK where they are most common in arable areas 
where cereal growing predominates (Harris & Yalden, 2008). The majority of the records made 
were of animals within arable fields, albeit close to field margins, near hedgerows or the railway 
corridor. 
Hedgehog 
4.44 
The closest record of a hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus provided in the results of the desk study 
was approximately 190 m to the west of the Survey Site. Hedgehogs are found in most lowland 
habitats but have a preference for grassland in close proximity to woodland, scrub or hedgerows 
(Harris & Yalden, 2008). 
4.45 
No incidental observations of hedgehog were made during the 2014 surveys.

Harvest Mouse 
4.46 
The harvest mouse Micromys minutus favours areas of tall, dense grassy vegetation with breeding 
nests often constructed in cereal crops, long grass, reed beds, rushes and bramble patches (Harris 
& Yalden, 2008). This species was identified in the north of the Survey Site during clearance of the 
arable/ruderal habitats in autumn 2012 as part of the great crested newt licence works (Steven 
Foot, pers comm). 
4.47 
Some of the denser marginal vegetation adjacent to the proposed access track, the field margins 
and within the understorey of the plantation mixed woodland in the centre of the Survey Site has 
the potential to support this species; however, no incidental observations of harvest mouse were 
made during the 2014 surveys.

Introduction 
1.1 
Preamble 
Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) has been instructed by Millbrook Power Ltd (the Client) to 
undertake a Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment for an area of land that lies within and 
around the Rookery South clay pit, approximately 1km to south of the village of Stewartby, in 
Marston Vale, Bedfordshire. This report has been prepared to support a Development 
Consent Order (DCO) application to develop the application area for the construction of a 
proposed gas fired electricity peaking plant. 
1.2 
Background 
The Rookery South clay pit (comprising an area of approximately 95 ha) and adjoining 
Rookery North clay pit (approximately 70 ha), were previously used for clay extraction from 
the Oxford Clay Formation to use in brick manufacture at the Stewartby Brickworks. The 
former clay pits have been largely worked out, with basal levels in the Rookery South pit left 
largely as they were after excavation apart from some minor areas of reworked ground and 
partial buttressing of the pit edge side slopes to improve their stability. At the time of writing 
this report the Rookery South pit was disused and partially flooded. A site layout plan is 
presented as Figure 2. 
Clay extraction ceased in 1986 and a programme of restoration has been proposed for the 
Rookery South pit as a whole by the current site owner O&H Properties Limited. The proposed 
low level restoration scheme (LLRS) will be implemented prior to the development of the site 
and will involve the use of soils, overburden and a proportion of the remaining clay reserves to 
re-profile the base of the pit, and buttress the side slopes to improve their stability. These 
restoration works are described in more detail in Section 1.5 below.  
The wider site area has been the subject of several previous ground investigations and reports 
compiled by PBA and others. The following sections of the report draw upon previous studies 
and site investigation information primarily from the following reports:

Objectives 
This report presents a Phase 1 ground condition assessment comprising a desk study, site 
walkover and Tier 1 preliminary qualitative contamination risk assessment and land instability 
appraisal. 
The objective of the Phase 1 is to identify the likely ground conditions and environmental 
setting that might have associated environmental liabilities or which may affect 
redevelopment, as well as appraising the likely geological or geotechnical hazards at the site. 
The Phase 1 desk study and site inspection report is the minimum requirement under the 
National Planning Policy Framework for land potentially affected by contamination or 
instability. This will be considered a brownfield development. 
It should be noted that this Phase 1 assessment is a land condition assessment and does not 
purport to be an ecological, flood risk or archaeological survey and additional specific surveys 
may be required to support a planning application. Guidance on the use of this report is 
provided in Section 7. 
1.4 
Site Location and Setting 
The application land area lies partly within and to the south of the Rookery South clay pit, 
approximately 1km to south of the village of Stewartby, in Marston Vale, Bedfordshire. 
The application area includes a section of land within the Rookery South clay pit that it is 
understood will house the power generating equipment (The Generating Equipment Site). 
Adjacent to the north of this there is a small temporary Laydown area that will be used during 
the construction process. The total Operation and Laydown (Construction) area is around 13 
hectares. 
The application area also includes a vehicular access corridor road (The Access Route). It 
runs in a southerly direction from Green Lane along the western perimeter of the Rookery 
North pit and then descends via an access ramp in the north-western corner of Rookery South 
pit. It then traverses south at a low level within the base of Rookery South pit to meet the 
northern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site. The road will be some 1.5km in length. 
A large parcel of agricultural land bounding the south of the clay pit is included within the wider 
application area. This land comprises approximately 215 hectares that will be utilised for a 
Electrical Connection to the existing 400kV overhead line and a link to the National 
Transmission System (NTS) gas pipeline, located some 1.2km to the southeast of the 
Generating Equipment Site site (The Electrical Connection Area). The Electrical Connection 
routes have not been fully defined and will occupy narrow corridors of land somewhere within 
this Electrical Connection area. 
The remaining parts of the wider Rookery South clay pit bound the immediate northern and 
eastern boundaries of the operation area, with agricultural land located further to the east of 
the London to Sheffield (mainline) railway that bisects the site running in a north to south 
direction. The western boundary of the wider application site is largely bounded by the 
Bedford to Bletchley (‘Marston Vale’) railway line and Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, 
with Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground located further to the south west.

South Pillinge Farm is located to the immediate southwest of the Generating Equipment Site. 
This site is currently accessed via a track leading from Green Lane 1.2km to the north of the 
proposed Generating Equipment Site. The Operation area is centred at National Grid 
Reference (NGR) TL 012 406. A site location plan is presented as Figure 1. 
A site layout plan, annotated with features discussed in this report is presented as Figure 2.  
1.5 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
Before development of the subject site it is understood that the proposed LLRS for Rookery 
South will be implemented and will therefore form the baseline conditions for the Project Site. 
Planning Permission has been granted for the LLRS under application numbers 
BC/CM/2000/9 and BC/CM/2000/8. In summary the LLRS for the Rookery South pit will 
comprise:  
1) Topsoil stripping from an area to the immediate south of Rookery South pit to enable 
further overburden and clay extraction from this area. 
2) Excavation of soils, overburden and clay from the southern area to provide engineered 
clay fill and restoration soils for the re-profiling and buttressing works around the pit 
edges. 
3) Re-profiling of the base of Rookery South pit, graded to falls, utilising clay won from the 
southern area, resulting in topographic levels in the vicinity of the proposed Generating 
Equipment Site of approximately 30m – 31m AOD. 
4) Construction of a new vehicular access track into the southwestern corner of the pit to 
provide low level access to the pit. 
5) Buttressing of slopes on the southern, eastern and northern sides of the Rookery South 
pit to provide a slope stabilisation solution to existing slopes. 
6) Provision of surface water management ditches in the reprofiled pit base discharging to an 
attenuation pond located in northwest corner of Rookery South pit. The surface water 
ditches and attenuation pond will include habitat mitigation and enhancement measures. 
7) Provision of pumping station to enable discharge of collected waters from the attenuation 
pond to Stewartby Lake with additional provision of a pumped emergency flow to Rookery 
North and reverse flow drainage

electricity and subsequent export of that electricity to the NETS. The land upon which the 
Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development 
of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’ The Project is described in more detail in 
Section 2, including the options currently under consideration for the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection. 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former clay pits known as 
‘The Rookery’, with the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into 
adjacent agricultural land. 
1.7 
Methodology and Report Format 
The PBA methodology for ground condition contamination assessment is presented in 
Appendix 1. 
The underlying principle is the evaluation of pollutant linkages in order to assess whether the 
presence of a source of contamination could potentially lead to harmful consequences. A 
pollutant linkage consists of the following three elements: 
 
A source of contamination or hazard that has the potential to cause harm or pollution; 
 
A pathway for the hazard to move along / generate exposure; and 
 
A receptor which is affected by the hazard.  
For each potential pollutant linkage identified the risk is estimated through consideration of the 
magnitude of the potential consequences and the likelihood or probability of an event 
occurring. 
This report is divided into chapters identifying potential sources (hazard identification), 
potential pathway and receptor identification and risk estimation and assessment. 
The ground stability assessment includes a review of all the available historical ground 
investigation information relating to the proposed application site and published information 
relating to the geoenvironmental setting. The primary geotechnical objective of this study was 
to undertake an assessment of the geotechnical constraints present at the proposed 
application site in accordance with NPPF in order to assist with informing the DCO application 
for future redevelopment of the site.

Land Use Information 
2.1 
Introduction 
This section presents a summary of current and historical land uses on and immediately 
adjacent to the Project Site. Land use is used to inform the hazard identification element of the 
risk assessment. 
The current land use information is based on a walkover inspection undertaken by PBA on the 
4th August 2014. Photographs taken during the site walkover (Plates 1 to 6) are presented in 
Appendix 2.  
The historical land use information is based largely on archive information held by PBA, 
supplemented by Ordnance Survey maps and aerial photography provided by Landmark and 
presented in Appendix 3. 
The main features noted during the site walkover are marked on the Site Layout Plan (Figure 
2). 
For simplicity and ease of reading, the site descriptions have been split into three sections; the 
site of the generating equipment and laydown area (Generating Equipment Site) in the base of 
the Rookery South Pit, the Access Route providing connectivity between the Generating 
Equipment Site and Green Lane, and the area of the Electrical Connections adjacent to the 
south of the clay pit (Electrical Connection Area). 
2.2 
Current Land Use 
2.2.1 
On-Site – Generating Equipment Site (Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area)  
The Generating Equipment Site of the site lies within the base of the Rookery South clay pit. 
The pit is currently some 15m lower than the natural surrounding ground level. The base of 
the pit in this area is roughly level and sparsely vegetated, with no features of note observed 
within the excavation. The southern part of the site area includes the southern bank of the clay 
pit, which is again sparsely vegetated. The western bank lies immediately beyond the western 
boundary of this part of the site, and comprises a split level pit edge slope. 
2.2.2 
On-site – Access Route  
The Access Route to the Generating Equipment Site is located in the base of the Rookery 
South pit at its southernmost extent. The access road then turns west and curves to the north 
and runs along the western site boundary between Rookery North Pit lake and the Bedford to 
Bletchley railway line, that is currently occupied by an access track and a hedgerow running 
alongside the railway line. The Access Route meets Green Lane at its northernmost extent. 
2.2.3 
On-Site – Electrical Connection Area  
The section of the site currently comprises agricultural land located adjacent to the south and 
southeast of the Rookery South clay pit. The land comprises around sixteen discrete fields. At 
the time of the walkover the land was mainly cropped with wheat.  
The land rises to the crest of a hill some 600m to the south of the clay pit with maximum 
elevation of around 71 mAOD. This higher ground generally runs in a northwest/southeast 
direction, with land falling to the north towards the clay pit.  
The London, Midland and Scottish mainline railway line runs through the central parts of this 
site area in a north-south direction. Millbrook Road also crosses the eastern portion of this site

area, orientated in a northeast-southwest direction; Millbrook Road crosses the mainline 
railway some 400m to the north of the southern site boundary.  
33kV electricity pylons cross part of the Electrical Connection area. These enter along the 
central southern boundary of the site some 100m to the west of the railway. The pylons run in 
a north-westerly direction and exit the site boundary immediately to the south of South Pillinge 
Farm.  
Two small watercourses (drainage ditches) are marked on the OS map as flowing through this 
land, one parallel to the west of the railway and another 500m to the west of the railway

Off-Site Generating Equipment Site 
 
North: The remainder of the Rookery South clay pit bounds the north of the Generating 
Equipment Site site, beyond which is the Rookery North pit, Green Lane and the 
redundant Stewartby Brickworks site. Stewartby Village lies adjacent to the north of the 
Rookery North pit some 1200m to the north of the Generating Equipment Site. 
 
East: The remainder of the Rookery South Pit bounds the east of the Generating 
Equipment Site, beyond which is a railway line and agricultural land.

Proving Ground is situated. 
2.3 
Summary of On-Site Historical Land Use 
2.3.1 
Electrical Connection Area 
 
The earliest available historical map (1883/1884) shows the Electrical Connection area to be 
undeveloped and comprise around twenty agricultural fields. The London, Midland and Scottish 
Railway is shown to bisect the eastern part of this land orientated in a north-south direction. 
Millbrook Road is marked within the eastern part of this area crossing the railway line via a bridge 
within the southeast corner. A small house and a well are marked close to the southern boundary 
adjacent to the east of Millbrook Road. Several drains running along field boundaries and tracks 
cross the area as well as two footpaths. An area of woodland in the south-western quadrant 
occupies approximately a fifth of the site area. Around eight small ponds are present within the 
eastern third of the site, possibly for livestock purposes. 
 
The next available map dated 1901 shows few on-site land-use changes. A small (70m x 100m) 
area of raised land labelled as ‘Rises’ is marked adjacent to the west of the railway line, close to 
the Millbrook Road bridge crossing. It is unclear from the map what this is used for.

 
No further on-site land-use changes could be identified until the map dated 1978, whereby 
electricity pylons and associated cables are marked crossing this part of the site. The route of the 
pylons enters the site along the central part of the southern boundary and exits along the western 
boundary, 200m to the south of South Pillinge Farm. 
 
On the map dated 1990 the small ponds are no longer marked, and are assumed to have been 
infilled 
 
The 2006 map indicates that some of the field boundaries have been removed to make way for 
larger fields. The field drainage is more clearly marked with a drain running from close to the 
railway bridge in a northerly direction to the edge of the Rookery South clay pit, then tuning in a 
westerly direction towards South Pillinge Farm. 
 
The 2014 map shows no changes in land-use except for a ‘mast’ that is shown to have been 
erected adjacent to the east of the railway in the north of the site area. 
2.3.2 
Generating Equipment Site 
 
The earliest available map indicates this area of the site falls within the boundaries of four 
agricultural fields. Two farm tracks originating from South Pillinge Farm cross this area.  
 
No land use changes are marked in this area of the site until the map dated 1982. This map 
shows that this part of the site and the extreme north of the Electrical Connection area is occupied 
by a clay pit, extending beyond the north of the site area and forming part of the wider Rookery 
South clay pit.  
 
By 2006 the clay pit is marked as disused with no features whatsoever marked within this part of 
the site, understood to now occupy part of the base of the clay pit. 
2.3.3 
Access Road 
 
The earliest available map (1883) shows the proposed route of the access road to run alongside 
the Bedford Branch of the London and Northwest Railway, through four agricultural fields. No 
further features of note are marked within this site area. 
 
No changes in on-site land use are marked until the map dated 1982. This area of the site now 
lies wholly within the clay pits of Rookery South and Rookery North (marked as disused). A 
conveyor and an access track are marked running along the western pit boundary, these fall within 
the boundary of the access road where it follows this part of the site. An electrical substation is 
also marked within this area located some 300m to the south of Green Lane adjacent to the 
access track. 
 
The Map dated 2006 indicates that the part of the site which falls within the Rookery North pit is 
occupied by water, expected to be the flooded base of the clay pit. The conveyor remains along 
the western boundary although it is now shown to run in an easterly direction at the junction of the 
Rookery South and Rookery North pits. The base of the Rookery South pit is not shown to be 
flooded at this time. 
 
The next available map (2014) shows little change in the land use of this part of the site. Some 
water is now shown within the base of the Rookery South pit, and this is shown to underlie the 
eastern extent of this access road. 
2.4 
Summary of Notable Off-Site Historical Land Uses 
 
The earliest available Ordnance Survey maps from 1889 – 1892 show that the proposed 
application site was situated in open agricultural land. The railway lines that border the Rookery 
Pits were already constructed at this time and Millbrook Station had been developed (700m to the 
southwest of the Generating Equipment Site) in association with the western railway line. The

Morteyns Arms Inn was also present adjacent to the station at this time. The settlement of 
‘Wooton Pillinge’ is marked approximately 1.2km north of the proposed application site, and to the 
north of that, the early stages of the Pillinge Brickworks are shown (approx 1.8km N of the 
Generating Equipment Site). A group of buildings labelled as ‘Pillinge Farm South’ were located 
400m to the southwest of the Generating Equipment Site and ‘Magpie Hall’ was situated 400m to 
the east of the Generating Equipment Site. A number of footpaths and land drains ran across the 
area. 
 
The maps from 1901 show some small developments at the Millbrook Station with construction of 
a ‘goods shed’. The ‘Pillinge Brickworks’ are shown to have undergone expansion, with two new 
clay pits shown adjacent to the railway line. Two semi-detached properties, marked as ‘Pillinge 
Cottages, are also shown on the 1901 maps approximately 150m south of Pillinge Farm South. 
 
A ‘Brickworks’ is first noted on the 1902 map approximately 500m to the north of the Green Lane. 
Expansion of this brickworks site takes place over the subsequent decades, with an engine house 
marked by 1927. The clay pits adjacent to the west of the brickworks site are shown to have 
expanded and have reached their maximum extent by 1927. Significant expansion of the site is 
shown on the map dated 1938 with the Pillinge Brickworks site now renamed as the Stewartby 
Brickworks occupying a large area of land to the north of Green Lane. Continued expansion is 
shown up until the map dated 1983. By 1983 the site occupies an area of some 700m x 1800m 
with numerous chimneys, tanks kilns and conveyors marked. The Brickworks site now bounds the 
land adjacent to the north of Green Lane, some 50m to the north of the northern boundary of the 
proposed access road for the subject site. 
 
The 1938 maps show the start of construction of the village of Stewartby immediately to the north 
of Rookery North (1.2km N of the Generating Equipment Site).  
 
The commencement of clay extraction from Rookery North occurred in around 1960 with 
excavations starting in the north and progressing southwards. The excavations within Rookery 
North were nearing completion at the southern extent of the pit by the early 1970’s. Further 
excavations progressed on the southern side of the central causeway within the Rookery South Pit 
and continued up until about 1986.  
 
Station Road was constructed in the early 1970s, connecting the town of Millbrook (to the south of 
the Generating Equipment Site) with Millbrook Station (to the southwest of the Generating 
Equipment Site). 
 
South Pillinge Farm was extended with construction of seven new outbuildings in the late 1970s. 
Pillinge Cottages (two semi detached properties), situated 140m south of the farm buildings, and 
an electrical sub-station, situated 250m north of the farm buildings, were also constructed at this 
time.  
 
Anecdotal accounts and review of historical aerial photographs suggest that the Rookery North pit 
was partially backfilled during the period from about 1971 to 1997. The Envirocheck report has 
indicated that the Rookery North pit was licensed as a ‘co-disposal landfill’. Further details 
provided by the Environment Agency have indicated that non-hazardous organic waste from a 
variety of local industrial sources were mixed with surface waters from the Rookery Pit and 
‘Callow’ deposits (see Section 4) and pumped into the base of the pit. The licensed area for these 
operations covered all of the Rookery North pit and the northern third of the Rookery South pit. A 
copy of the Environment Agency plan showing the extent of the licence boundary shows details of 
the waste sources as follows: non-notifiable mineral wastes (including ‘neosid’ ferrite sludge, lime 
and water from water softening treatments and Hargreaves fertiliser waste), food wastes (from 
Coca Cola, Rosa Poultry, Telfers and Unilever), leather wastes and gelatine wastes from ‘Croda’. 
 
The 1983 maps show expansion of the village of Stewartby and the Stewartby Brickworks, to the 
north of the proposed application site. The brick pit adjacent to the Stewartby Brickworks is now 
shown to be partly occupied by land  .and development of a large open area marked as a ‘vehicle 
proving ground’ 750m to the southwest of the proposed application site. The pits previously 
excavated to the northwest of the proposed application site are shown to be flooded and are

marked as ‘Stewartby Lake’. Just to the south of Stewartby Lake, and to the west of the proposed 
application site, an additional lake is present. This area was further altered in the period between 
1999 and 2008 when additional lakes had been created as wetland habitats (the ‘Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park’). 
 
An engineering works is noted some 250m to the southeast of the site boundary of the Electrical 
Connection area, marked within Reddings’s Wood. Further expansion is shown on the map dated 
1978 along with a factory. By 1990 several new buildings have been constructed, with the site now 
marked as an Engineering Research Establishment.

Environmental Setting 
3.1 
Geology  
3.1.1 
Geological Map and Regional Geology 
According to the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geological Maps (1:50,000 Sheet 203 and 
1:10,000 Sheet TL 04 SW) the solid geology of the area generally consists of the following 
sequence of strata: 
 
The Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation (highly plastic fossiliferous 
clay);  
 
Underlain by the Kellaways Formation (sandy clays and clayey sands of the Kellaways 
Sand Member with an underlying stiff shelly clay called the Kellaways Clay Member);  
 
Underlain by the Cornbrash Formation (limestone) and the Blisworth Clay Formation and 
Blisworth Limestone Formation at depth.  
In the area of the proposed electrical Electrical Connection apparatus in the south of the site 
the geological map records unworked Oxford Clay comprising the Stewartby Member and the 
Weymouth Member which underlies the vast majority of this area. The Peterborough Member 
of the Oxford Clay is shown to outcrop in the northwest corner of the Electrical Connection 
area. 
Small sections of the site area are indicated by the map as having superficial Quaternary 
Valley Gravel and Alluvium present, associated with former and current streams adjacent to 
the east of the railway line, albeit some of these deposits may have been removed by the 
more recent clay extraction works. A further tract of alluvial deposits is shown on the 
geological map being present adjacent to the east of South Pillinge Farm. Quaternary head 
deposits comprising clay, silt, sand and gravel are also marked in some parts of the site, 
namely along the southwestern boundary adjacent to south Pillinge Farm and another area in 
the southeast of the Electrical Connection area adjacent to Millbrook Road, and along Ampthill 
Road. 
Superficial Deposits and weathered Oxford Clay were unsuitable for the brickmaking process 
and this material was removed and cast back into the pit. Locally it was called Callow and for 
the purposes of this report is called Callow, when in-situ, and Callow Clay Fill, when disturbed 
and placed at a new location. The Callow Clay Fill sometimes contains brick fragments 
because broken brick rubble was used for making temporary pads and machinery stands. 
Generally excavations left around 0.5 to 1.0m of remnant Oxford Clay in the base of the pit 
overlying the Kellaways Sand, although this was dependant on the workmanship of the 
machine operators and in places the layer of remnant clay is thicker or absent. 
The unweathered Oxford Clay was called Knotts by the local brickmaking industry. The Oxford 
Clay Formation supported a major brickmaking industry locally because its high organic 
content reduced the amount of fuel required to ‘fire’ the clay, and its carbonate content was 
ideally suited to brickmaking. 
Historical clay extraction from the Rookery Pit has resulted in ground levels in the base of the 
pit some 15m – 25m lower than the surrounding ground. 
3.1.2 
Site Specific Ground Conditions from Previous Ground Investigations 
Information on the ground conditions from within the site have been taken from CL Associates 
(2000) and with reference to wider BGS records, and other studies undertaken by PBA in the 
vicinity of the site within Rookery South and North pits including PBA (2009b) and PBA (2011).

Copies of the exploratory hole records that fall within or close to the site area are presented in 
Appendix 4.  
Electrical Connection Area 
Exploratory hole records for this area are only present in the northwestern corner of this part 
of the site. The records from within this area confirm the presence of ‘reworked topsoil’ 
comprising soft brown slightly sandy slightly gravelly clay to around 0.2m bgl. This was 
reportedly underlain by weathered Oxford Clay comprising soft and firm light orange brown 
mottled slightly sandy clay proven to around 3.5m bgl . This was underlain by Oxford Clay 
recorded as firm dark green brown laminated very silty clay proven in the boreholes to depths 
of between 13.8m bgl (BH4) and 20.5m bgl (BH6). The Kellaways Formation was identified 
underlying the Oxford Clay, recorded as interbedded dark grey sand and firm grey green clay 
with occasional shell fragments. The Kellaways Formation was proven to between 19.75m bgl 
and 24.65m bgl in the areas investigated. The Cornbrash Formation recorded as dark grey 
fine to medium grained muddy limestone was identified underlying the Kellaways Formation, 
and was proven to a maximum depth of 24.9m bgl (BH6). 
Generating Equipment Site and Access Road  
On the basis of the available exploratory hole records, the strata thicknesses in the base of 
the pit are expected to be variable, although consistent in terms of sequencing. Made Ground 
in the form of Callow Clay fill was reported in several of the exploratory holes proven to a 
maximum depth of 4.70m in TP14, the base of the Made Ground was not proven in this 
location. In general the thicknesses of Made Ground (recorded as reworked clay comprising 
firm grey brown slightly gravelly cobbly clay) appear to be greater towards the centre of the pit. 
Where the exploratory holes are closer to the edges of the pit, the thicknesses of Made 
Ground are less or it is altogether absent. In BH13 Made Ground was recorded to a depth of 
0.45m bgl, underlain by Oxford Clay proven to a depth of 4.0m bgl. This was underlain by the 
Kellaways Formation proven to 8.4m bgl, and then by the Cornbrash Formation proven to a 
depth of 8.8m bgl. The base of the Cornbrash was not proven. 
Since the base of the pit is roughly level, on the basis of the exploratory hole records it is 
anticipated to be underlain by a thickness of either around 4m of Callow Clay or remnant 
Oxford Clay or a combination of the two depending on the location within the base of the pit.  
3.1.3 
Slope Stability 
Rookery South 
At the time of the site walkover the majority of the western face of the Rookery South pit was 
observed to be formed at angles of 1Vertical(V):2Horizontal(H) to 1V:3H. The slope here rises 
from the base of the pit at approximately 26m AOD to 28m AOD to a bench level at 
approximately 38m AOD. The upper bench is approximately 30m in width, with a second slope 
further westwards rising to the perimeter level at approximately 42m AOD at an angle of 
approximately 1V:2.5H.  
On the northern section of the western face, in the vicinity of the proposed access ramp, the 
slope profile is formed at characteristically lower gradients. The toe of the slope is situated 
along the same alignment as the section further south but the width of the upper bench is 
reduced from 30m to approximately 12m. The resultant slope is at a lower gradient than that 
further south and is formed at angles of 1V:3.5H to 1V:4H. 
Inspection of the western pit face has not revealed the presence of significant failures other 
than minor slope wash and sloughing in the exposed face in places. 
Rookery North 
Within the Rookery North pit the southern and eastern pit faces have all been modified by the 
placement of sludge fill material covered with Callow Clay Fill in the base of the pit, forming 
shallow gradient slopes of around 1V:16H, that fan out from apparent deposition locations in

the south-eastern parts of the pit. These deposits typically extend part way up the pit faces but 
in the south-eastern corner of the pit, the bank of deposits extends up to the level of the 
central causeway at approximately 52m AOD. The western and north-western faces, where 
they boarder to the access road, appear to be at their as cut angles of approximately 1V:2H to 
1V:3H. However, the full height of these faces is obscured by the water body in the pit and 
only the Callow faces can be seen. 
Several small scale failures were noted within the exposed Callow faces along the central 
parts of the northern wall, i.e to the east of the new junction and access road. These small 
scale features have resulted in near vertical back scars of typically 1m – 2m in height. These 
failures coincide with the water levels within the lake and appear to represent a wave cut 
platform formed as a result of wave erosion affecting the stability of the Callow material. 
3.1.4 
Naturally Occurring Geological Hazards 
An assessment of potential geological hazards that may give rise to instability or adverse 
foundation or construction conditions as supplied by the British Geological Survey (BGS) from 
their National Geoscience Information Service (NGIS) are presented in the Envirocheck 
Report reproduced in Appendix 3. The generic assessment is generated automatically based 
on digital geological maps and the scope and the accuracy is limited by the methods used to 
create the dataset and the excavations and landform modifications undertaken at the site. The 
BGS dataset is therefore only relavent for the search area. 
The information contained in the Groundsure Report has been reviewed and where 
considered necessary reassessed considering the specific information available for the site. 
The modified assessment of the potential for geological hazards to be present on the site is 
summarised in Table 3.1 below.

PBA would generally agree with the above assessments indicating that the site generally has 
a low or very low potential for being affected by the majority of geological hazards.  
The exceptions to this are hazards associated with landslide ground stability which are 
anticipated to be related to the slopes of the Rookery South clay pit that cross part of the 
subject site.  
Given the implementation of the Low Level Restoration Scheme before commencement of the 
project, this risk will be reduced to the level of very low through the regrading of the side 
slopes of the pit to a slope angle that will provide long term stability. 
Compressible ground stability hazards are highlighted as moderate owing to the presence of 
callow clay fill within the base of the clay pit. Some of this fill will be in its ‘as placed’ un-
engineered condition and will be susceptible to long term consolidation settlement under its 
self-weight and/or any surface applied loads. Some engineered fill will be placed over the 
areas of callow clay fill to deliver the LLRS. PBA would tend to agree with this assessment on 
the basis of the exploratory hole records present within the site footprint, that suggest variable

Equipment Site.

Radon

in an area where no radon protective measures are necessary in the construction of new 
dwellings or extensions. 
3.1.6 
Natural and Non-Coal Mining Cavity Records – Cavity Searches 
A search of the PBA Natural and Non-Coal Mining Cavities Databases indicates that there are 
no known cavity locations within 2000m of the site boundary. 
3.2 
Hydrogeology 
According to the Environment Agency website, the Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and the 
Blisworth Clay Formations are classified as Unproductive Strata, with the Cornbrash 
Formation a Secondary A Aquifer and the Blisworth Limestone Formation and Kellaways Sand 
a Principal Aquifer. 
The clayey deposits of the Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay 
Formation have been shown to be of extremely low permeability and can be considered as 
being aquicludes. Whilst the Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash Formation are classified as Minor 
Aquifers, they have been shown by extensive investigation for the brickmaking, landfill/waste 
deposition industry and other developments, to be insignificant for water resources purposes 
in this region due to their limited thickness, low permeability and poor water quality. These 
formations are considered herein to act as aquitards. The Blisworth Limestone Formation has 
been shown to be of a slightly higher permeability but also of naturally poor water quality.  
The elevation of the base of the pit inside the development area is between 27m and 30m 
AOD, and once the LLRS has been implemented the base of the pit is expected to lie between 
31.6m and 31.0m AOD. Piezometric levels underlying the pit floor have been recorded at 
approximately 28m AOD to 29.5m AOD in the Kellaways Sand, approximately 27m AOD – 
29.5m AOD in the Cornbrash Formation and approximately 30m AOD – 32m AOD in the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation. Although there is no evidence at all to suggest that hydraulic 
uplift (or heave) caused by groundwater pressures has occurred in the pit base in the past, 
assessments of the potential for hydraulic uplift have shown that the factor of safety is 
acceptable and there is no risk of heave occurring once the LLRS has been implemented. 
These assessments are given in PBA 2009 and PBA 2009b. 
A summary of the permeabilities of the strata underlying the site and the respective 
groundwater elevations are presented in Table 3.2 below.

3.3 
Groundwater Conditions 
In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been identified as being poor with saline 
conditions reported from the majority of reports and investigations (PBA, 2009b).  
Historical monitoring of water quality within the Kellaways Formation and the Blisworth 
Limestone Formation (undertaken on 15 occasions during the period February 2000 – 
November 2002 by CLA within the monitoring boreholes installed as part of the CLA (2000) 
investigations) has confirmed that the quality of the groundwater within the Kellaways 
Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation is similar in nature, and is generally poor 
with elevated concentrations of electrical conductivity, chloride, sulphate, ammoniacal 
nitrogen, boron and zinc when compared to the relevant assessment criteria. 
The historical groundwater monitoring data has been supplemented by groundwater samples 
taken from the Kellaways Formation as part of the PBA 2010 investigation from a total of three 
locations on two occasions. The results from the recent groundwater monitoring are included 
within Appendix 3. In general, the recent groundwater quality data is similar to that previously 
recorded by CLA. During the PBA 2010 investigation, hydrocarbon analysis of the 
groundwater retained from the Kellaways Formation from BH103 (on one occasion) recorded 
a concentration of 0.026mg/l. A subsequent sample was taken from the same borehole and 
the result showed a concentration below the detection limit. It is likely that the initial 
concentration was the result of remnant dilute drilling fluid within the borehole at the time of 
sampling on the first occasion, which has now been removed by the sampling and purging 
process. 
In summary, the quality of the groundwater recorded is considered to be naturally occurring 
and typical of baseline conditions in similar geological settings. There are no indicators of 
anthropogenic contamination. 
3.4 
Hydrology – Summary of Surface Water Monitoring Results 
Assessment of the quality of the surface water bodies in the vicinity of Rookery Pit has been 
undertaken since 1999. During this time surface water samples have been taken from the 
lakes in Rookery South and Rookery North, Harrowden Brook, Elstow Brook, the drainage 
ditches to the south (the Mill Brook tributary) and west (Mill Brook watercourse) of the site and 
Stewartby Lake to the west of the proposed application site. A summary of the historical data 
is presented in the PBA (2009b) report. 
Monitoring of the surface water quality within the lake in Rookery South, previously 
undertaken by CLA in 1999 – 2000, recorded elevated sulphate levels (1,500mg/kg – 
2,000mg/kg) and electrical conductivity levels (2,800S/cm – 3050S/cm) but no other 
determinants tested were significantly elevated against the screening criteria such as 
cyanides, metals and potential organic contaminants. Similar conditions were recorded within 
the lake in the Rookery North pit at the same time. Monitoring of the surface waters within the 
ditches and brooks surrounding the Rookery Pits, undertaken at the same time, recorded 
similar conditions, albeit that the sulphate concentrations and electrical conductivity values 
were generally lower than within the lakes. 
Monitoring of the surface water quality within Elstow Brook and the lakes in the Rookery North 
and Rookery South pits and the Stewartby Lake has been undertaken on four occasions by 
PBA (in June – August 2008, January 2009 and April 2011) as part of a study of the wider 
Marston Vale area. Water samples were analysed for suspended soils, copper, lead, zinc, 
phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, Biological Oxygen Demand, sulphate, ammonia, chloride, 
electrical conductivity, nitrate, pH and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons. The results showed 
similar characteristics as the data collected previously by CLA, with electrical conductivity 
levels and sulphate concentrations elevated within the lakes on the Rookery North and 
Rookery South pits but lower concentrations within the surrounding water bodies. Based upon

the recorded BOD and ammonia results, water quality would be classified as Class A (very 
good) according to the Environment Agency GQA scheme. 
3.5 
Landfill Records 
According to the Envirocheck Report there is a landfill marked within the footprint of the 
Rookery North and the northern third of the Rookery South pits. The licence is held by London 
Brick Landfill Ltd at Rookery Clay Pit. Input dates were between 1971 and 1987 with 
deposited waste including industrial and household waste and liquid sludge. No other landfills 
are noted within 500m of the site boundary. 
Previous investigations confirm that the Rookery South pit was not used for landfilling of 
household waste or liquid sludge, although the base of the pit has been proven to be 
underlain by a variable thickness of reworked clay in the form of Callow Clay Fill. It is 
understood a small area in the northeast corner of the Rookery South pit is underlain by a 
greater thickness of reworked clay that forms a lobe shaped feature. Extensive investigation of 
this feature (PBA 2011) suggests that it is inert and comprises reworked Callow Clay Fill, and 
does not include liquid wastes, sludges or household waste. Its origins are not entirely clear; 
however it is possible that this feature formed as a result of a land slip or from deposited clay 
overburden. 
Previous testing undertaken on the Callow Clay fill and lobe feature in Rookery South (PBA 
2011) indicates that the materials are inert in nature with low concentrations of potential 
contaminants with regard to the proposed end-use.  
The Stewartby Landfill site is marked some 50m to the northwest of the location of the access 
road. EA records suggest this site last received waste in 1986 and the site received inert, 
household, industrial, commercial and special wastes. 
3.6 
Substantiated Pollution Incidents 
The Envirocheck Report records one pollution incident to controlled waters approximately 
250m to the northeast of the site boundary; none are recorded on-site. The incident is

Discharge Consents 
The Envirocheck report details one discharge consent within the site boundary. The consent is 
related to discharge of final effluent from 3 Pillinge Cottages to a freshwater stream within the 
site boundary. The receiving water is noted to be a tributary of the Elstow Brook. 
It is understood that a second consent is also active within the site boundary associated with 
the Rookery Pits, although this record is not identified within the Envirocheck Report. Details 
of this “trade effluent” discharge consent relating to the Rookery South and Rookery North pits 
have been previously supplied by the current landowners. The consent understood to be 
currently in force, allows for pumping “trade effluent” (accumulated waters) from the Rookery 
Pits into the Mill Brook culvert beneath the railway line to the west of Rookery South and into 
Stewartby Lake. The points of note relating to this discharge consent are detailed below: 
 
The discharge must not contain any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter, or solid 
matter greater than 40mg/l; 
 
The discharge takes place through a brick lined channel into a partly culverted ditch 
leading to Stewartby Lake through an outlet at national Grid Reference TL 0112 4131; 
 
Whilst pumping is underway from the Rookery pits, sulphate and suspended solids 
concentrations are to be measured once a week (albeit that no constraints on 
concentrations are identified on the formal consent); and, 
 
The maximum volume of discharge is not to exceed 2,000m3 in a 24 hour period. 
3.10 Ecological Systems  
The Magic Map website provides geographic information about the natural environment from 
across government bodies and is managed by Natural England. The website confirms that 
there are no statutory designated ecological systems on-site or within 500m of the site 
boundary.

Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment 
4.1 
Introduction 
The methodology developed and adopted by PBA for the assessment of ground conditions is 
presented in Appendix 1. In accordance with guidance presented in CLR 11 (EA Model 
Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination) we adopt a staged approach to risk 
assessment and this report presents a preliminary Tier 1 assessment. 
The underlying principle to ground condition assessment is the identification of pollutant 
linkages in order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of contamination could 
potentially lead to harmful consequences.  
4.2 
Conceptual Site Model 
The Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment includes the development of a conceptual site model 
(CSM). The CSM describes the types and locations of potential contamination sources, the 
identification of potential receptors and the identification of potential transport/migration 
pathways. 
For a pollutant linkage to be identified a connection between all three elements (source-
pathway-receptor) is required. 
4.3 
Geoenvironmental Hazard Identification 
4.3.1 
On-Site - Electrical Connection Area 
This part of the site is currently occupied by agricultural farmland, and historical map evidence 
suggests this has always been the case. Given the intended use of this part of the site to 
provide an electrical and gas Electrical Connection there are not anticipated to be any 
pollutant linkages present, since no significant plausible contamination sources have been 
identified and the end use will not introduce any new receptors.  
The risk assessment has therefore only been taken forward for the Generating Equipment Site 
and the Access Road, where new plant, infrastructure and potential human heath receptors 
are expected to be introduced.  
4.3.2 
On-site – Generating Equipment Site and Access Road 
The site is in the southwest corner of a much larger former clay pit. The brickworks 
manufacturing operation was located approximately 1.3km north of the site, and consequently 
any potential contamination sources linked to the process of manufacturing and firing of bricks 
are expected to be located far enough away to not affect the subject site. 
A notable thickness of Callow Clay Fill (CCF) typically around 2.5m thick, but possibly in 
excess of 4.7m thick has been confirmed to be present across the Generating Equipment Site. 
This CCF has been recorded to take the form of reworked clay with occasional brick 
fragments and is consequently not expected to contain any significantly elevated 
concentrations of potential contaminants. Whilst contamination testing data is not available 
from the exploratory holes within the Generating Equipment Site itself, data is available from 
other exploratory holes within the Rookery South pit. The results of contamination testing 
undertaken by both CLA 2000 and by PBA 2009b for the consented Covanta RRF scheme are 
considered to be representative of the Generating Equipment Site because the historical and 
geographical setting of the Generating Equipment Site is identical to that of the wider pit area. 
Testing from the exploratory holes immediately adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site did 
not show any evidence of elevated concentrations of potential contaminants.

Phase 1\03 Reports\Phase 1 Report v0 FINAL.docx 
19 
Whilst there is the potential for small pockets of sporadic and discreet localised contamination 
to be present within the CCF, it is considered that the frequency and magnitude of any such 
localised contamination will be very small based upon the currently available information. 
Experience in contaminated land assessment by PBA of many other brickmaking sites from 
the same era in the former London Brick Company (LBC) landholding has indicated that the 
historical industrial activity of clay excavation and casting back of overburden, with 
reprofiling/landscaping carried out at these sites does not in itself give rise to significant levels 
of land contamination.  
The potential for contamination to be present based on the past and present site use is 
assessed as classification score ‘1’; Very Low. (see Table 1, Appendix 1). 
4.3.3 
Ground gases 
The previous ground investigations have not encountered any significant quantities of organic 
materials within the deposits underlying the proposed application site; however the Oxford 
Clay Formation is known to contain clay of a high organic content. Together with the presence 
of CCF beneath the site area, there is expected to be a potential for the low concentrations of  
ground gases in the form of carbon dioxide. However, due to the very low permeability of the 
Oxford Clay Formation, the potential for any ground gases to migrate to the surface, or 
laterally, is considered to be low. 
4.3.4 
Groundwater 
In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been identified as being poor with saline 
conditions reported from the majority of reports and investigations. In particular the 
Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) screening criteria have been exceeded for 
Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Boron, conductivity and Chloride. The concentrations recorded are 
considered to be naturally occurring and typical of baseline conditions in similar geological 
settings, and not a result of the on-site ground conditions. There are no indicators of 
anthropogenic contamination, and hydrocarbons have not been recorded above the screening 
criteria in the more recent analyses undertaken. 
4.3.5 
Surface Water  
Similarly, previous testing undertaken on the surface waters that form part of the wider site 
area indicate that elevated sulphate and electrical conductivity levels are present in the 
surface waters at the site. These were the only parameters that exceeded the screening 
criteria, and based on the results of the BOD and ammonia results the surface water quality 
would be assessed a Class A (Very Good) according to the Environment Agency CQA 
Scheme.  
In general, the surface water monitoring data largely reflects the chemistry of the groundwater 
data and shows that whilst naturally occurring substances are elevated within any relatively 
static water bodies (e.g Rookery North and Rookery South lakes), no significant 
anthropogenic contamination of the surface waters is occurring. 
4.3.6 
Off-Site 
The application area lies within a predominantly agricultural setting and consequently potential 
off-site sources of contamination were generally not identified. The exception to this is the 
Pillinge (Stewartby) Brickworks site and the Stewartby Landfill (which lie adjacent to the 
northern site boundary of the access road), the railway lines and sidings and South Pillinge 
Farm.  
Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground is located adjacent to the southwest boundary of the 
Electrical Connection area; however there are no records of any pollution incidents arising

from this facility within the Envirocheck Report. Furthermore, the distance of these sources 
from the site boundary in conjunction with the expected low permeability of the underlying 
geology means that any off-site contamination (if present) is not likely to affect the subject site, 
because there are not expected to be any feasible transmission pathways.  
Given the observations made during the previous investigations and the groundwater and 
surface water quality data that has been previously collected from the wider Marston Vale 
area, it is considered that the risk to the application site associated with potential off-site 
contamination to be present based on the past and present off-site land-use is assessed as 
classification score ‘1’; Very Low. (see Table 1, Appendix 1).

Risk Estimation 
Risk estimation involves predicting the likely consequence (what degree of harm might result) 
and the probability that the consequences will arise (how likely the outcome is). The table in 
Appendix 5 summarises the estimated risks for the identified pollutant linkages.  
When there is a pollutant linkage (and therefore some measure of risk) it is necessary to 
determine whether the risk matters and therefore whether further action is required. Risk 
estimation involves predicting the likely consequence (what degree of harm might result) and 
the probability that the consequences will arise (how likely the outcome is).  
The table in Appendix 5 presents an assessment of consequence and probability for each 
potential pollutant linkage identified. Based on the information available, and assuming a worst 
case scenario, the estimated risks have been designated as follows:

 
Buildings / Services – Very Low 
During construction phase the underlying ground will be exposed and there is an enhanced 
short term risk. 
The highest estimated risk of Very Low for human health is a function of: 
 
The relative absence of any likely potential sources of contamination. 
 
The relativeley low sensitivity of the proposed end use with regard to human health. 
 
The low sensitivity of the environmental setting surrounding the site.  
A very low risk is defined as where ‘there is a low possibility that harm could arise to a 
receptor. In the event of such harm being realised it is not likely to be severe.’ 
4.5.1 
Ground Gases 
It is anticipated that the risks to human health arising from naturally occurring ground gases in 
the clay beneath the site will be low to moderate, and it is anticipated (subject to testing) that 
any confined spaces may require gas protection measures and/or passive ventilation. 
4.6 
Risk Evaluation  
Possible pollutant linkages are determined using professional judgement. If a linkage is 
considered possible, it is considered that this represents a potentially ‘unacceptable risk’ and 
therefore requires further consideration. This may be through remediation or mitigation or 
through further tiers of assessment. 
4.7 
Confidence and Uncertainty  
Based on the known current and historical land uses, the overall potential for significant or 
widespread contamination to be present on the site is considered to be Very Low. Based on 
the available information on ground conditions, the potential for any deleterious material 
producing hazardous ground gases to be present is considered to be Low to Moderate.

The assessment presented herein is based on publically available land use and third party 
reports on intrusive investigations. Whilst the third party reports provide comfort that there is 
not likely to be site-wide gross contamination it is considered plausible, but unlikely, that there 
may be potential small scale, sporadic and discrete localised sources of contamination 
present on site that have not been identified as part of the current and previous studies.  An 
intrusive investigation would be required to provide actual ground condition data to confirm the 
presence/absence of contamination.

Preliminary Geotechnical Assessment 
5.1 
Introduction 
The following assessments have been undertaken in accordance with the NPPF, in order to 
determine whether the land is potentially unstable and identify any appropriate remedial, 
preventative or precautionary measures, as required. The assessments include consideration 
of the potential for unstable slopes, ground compression and shrinkage/heave in the context of 
the proposed development and the local geographical environment. 
The following sections of the report are based upon the geological / geotechnical information 
that has been collated from previous ground investigations and published information.  
5.2 
Implications of Proposed Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
It is recognised that the proposed LLRS will take place prior to commencement of the 
development. The LLRS will include regrading levels within the base of the pit by cut and 
placement of engineered fill, including the winning of clay fill from parts of the wider area. The 
earthworks in the base of the pit will be undertaken by placing Oxford Clay Fill in layers to 
raise ground levels and produce a fall across the pit towards an attenuation pond in the 
northern part of the Rookery South pit. It is proposed that the resulting topographic levels 
beneath the Generating Equipment Site will be approximately 31.8m AOD – 31.2m AOD, 
which equates to a limited thickness of fill above current levels of circa 0.5m in places and cut 
of up to 1.2m. 
5.3 
Potential Ground Settlement 
Historically the Callow Clay Fill was placed in the base of the pit without any compaction or 
surcharge control measures having been implemented, and will have settled under its self-
weight ever since. Parts of the Rookery South Pit have previously become inundated with 
water, albeit these are largely located in areas away from the proposed Generating Equipment 
Site, but may affect the access route in the base of Rookery South pit. These deposits may 
therefore currently be present in a relatively soft and compressible nature. Any new fill placed 
in the base as part of the LLRS will therefore induce additional consolidation settlement of the 
underlying historical Callow Clay Fill. 
PBA have previously undertaken detailed research and analysis of the potential for 
settlements to be induced by loading of historical Callow Clay Fill in the base of similar pits 
excavated in the Oxford Clay. Assessments have included one dimensional consolidation 
analysis in the laboratory and monitoring of in-situ settlements caused by surcharge loading. 
Results of one-dimensional consolidation testing showed Mv values, which describe the total 
magnitude of settlement, generally in the range 0.3 m2/MN to 0.4 m2/MN. Corresponding Cv 
values, which describe the time required for settlement to occur, ranged from 0.2 m2/year to 
1.4 m2/year. It has, however, been recognised that the Cv values from consolidation tests 
show considerable variation and estimates of the time required for settlement to occur are 
sensitive to these variations. Back-analysis of the in-situ settlement recorded in association 
with the construction of an earth embankment over Callow Clay Fill estimated actual Cv values 
in the range 1.6 m2/year to 3 m2/year.  
Utilising relatively conservative values, with an Mv value of 0.4 m2/Mn and a Cv value of 2 
m2/year, preliminary calculations show that for 0.5m of engineered fill placed over 2.5m 
Callow Clay Fill total settlements of about less than 20mm can be expected. In areas where 
thicker deposits of Callow Clay Fill have been recorded, or alternatively where thicker deposits 
of engineered fill will be placed, larger settlements will take place. It is, however, recognised 
that some areas of relatively thick Callow Clay Fill form topographic high points and will 
therefore require less engineered fill in order to produce the required platform levels.

24 
The currently envisaged programme for the placement of engineered fill as part of the LLRS 
and the subsequent development works suggests that construction will commence almost 
immediately after completion of the earthworks for the LLRS in the Generating Equipment Site 
and will be largely completed within 12 months. Given this timescale, settlement of the Callow 
Clay Fill induced by placement of any residual engineered fill will not be fully mobilised prior to 
construction and recognition of such should therefore be made in respect of the design of 
hard-surfacing and infrastructure not founded upon deeper naturally occurring materials, 
particularly in respect of any differential settlement that might occur. It may be necessary to 
incorporate mitigation measures into the design such as ground improvement or geogrid re-
inforcement to stiffen the ground present. 
Particular attention will need to be given to any areas where the characteristics and 
thicknesses of the underlying deposits vary across short distances such as at the edges of the 
pit. Here, there may be a considerable thickness on unimproved Callow Clay Fill banked 
against the relatively incompressible natural ground forming the steep original pit edge. 
Infrastructure such as roads, pavements and utilities could be at risk from unacceptably high 
magnitudes of differential settlement and careful consideration should be made of this risk in 
their design.  
5.4 
Access Road and Green Lane Junction 
The proposed development includes for provision of a new vehicular access junction from 
Green Lane into the existing open access area adjacent to the north-western corner of the 
Rookery North pit. In order to facilitate the required turning arcs for large construction vehicles 
the access road may pass relatively close to the perimeter crest of the pit. The design of the 
access road must therefore include assessment of the slope angle, the distance between the 
road and the slope and the resultant slope stability.  
Improvements to the slope profile within Rookery North pit in the north-western corner 
following further bathymetric surveys and stability analysis have been submitted and approved 
as part of the discharge of the LLRS planning conditions. 
5.5 
Foundations 
The ground conditions on the proposed application site are, in general, expected to form a 
suitable platform for the construction of proposed facility. For very lightly loaded elements of 
the proposed facility and elements that are able to tolerate differential movements, shallow 
spread footings constructed within the remaining Oxford Clay, and possibly in the overlying 
Callow Clay Fill and engineered development platform fill, could be an appropriate option.  
5.6 
Floor Slabs and Pavements 
Based upon the expected ground conditions present on the Generating Equipment Site, 
comprising Callow Clay Fill overlain by a limited thickness of engineered fill placed in the base 
of the pit as part of the LLRS, it is expected that lightly loaded ground bearing floor slabs and 
pavements constructed on a suitable depth of capping/sub-base and reinforced by geogrid as 
necessary will prove adequate.  
However, given the relatively soft nature of the Callow Clay Fill, any heavily loaded floor slabs 
will either need to be suspended on to piles or the ground will require improvement before the 
slabs are cast. Potential ground improvement techniques could include preloading and 
surcharging of the Callow Clay Fill in order accelerate the settlements, or improvement of soft 
materials by in-situ ground improvement techniques, such as the installation of vibratory stone 
or concrete columns. It should be recognised; however, that surcharging is a process that 
requires a certain period of time for porewater pressures to dissipate and for primary 
settlements to take place and it may be necessary to install additional drainage such as 
vertical sand drains for this to take place during an acceptable timescale.

5.7 
Clay Volume Change Potential 
Due to the highly plastic nature of the Oxford Clay, and the Callow deposits derived from it, 
the soils are liable to shrink or swell in response to changes in moisture content. Such 
changes in moisture content can occur due to seasonal or climatic effects but more commonly 
structural damage can occur when trees and hedgerows remove moisture from the soil at 
depth. Conversely removal of trees can cause swelling and structural damage as the soils re-
saturate. 
Guidance on foundation design in such circumstances is given in BRE Digests 240, 241, 242, 
298 and 412, and also in NHBC Standards Chapter 4.2, which can be applied as equally as 
appropriate to industrial buildings as houses. The historical laboratory testing on the soils 
present indicates that the in-situ Callow deposits exhibit a high volume change potential whilst 
the Callow Clay Fill and the Knotts exhibit a generally moderate volume change potential. It is 
recommended that a high volume change potential is assumed for those fill deposits that will 
be placed into the base of the pit as part of the LLRS. Particular attention will need to be given 
to the design of any foundations within the tree root zone of influence of the extensive tree 
screen proposed as part of the landscaping of the proposed application site. 
NHBC Chapter 4.2 recommends that for foundations outside of the zone of influence of any 
proposed trees or shrubs a minimum foundation depth of 1.0m should be adopted for high 
volume change potential soils. For any foundations inside the potential zone of influence of 
any proposed trees or shrubs foundation depths of 1.5m are appropriate, providing that 
absolute limits are agreed within the planting schedules to exclude any tree planting a certain 
distance to the foundations. The reader is referred to the NHBC guidance for further details 
regarding the zone of influence identified for a variety of different tree species. 
5.8 
Chemical Attack on Buried Concrete 
It should be recognised that the Oxford Clay is known to be sulphate and pyrite bearing and 
can therefore be corrosive to buried concrete. Groundwater and surface water monitoring data 
has also indicated that the waters present at the proposed application site are characterised 
by high chloride and high sulphate concentrations. It is recommended that checks on site 
specific conditions should be made prior to construction and the mix design of buried concrete 
should follow the recommendations of BRE Special Digest 1: Concrete in Aggressive ground 
(2005). Generally a design sulphate class of DS4 is required in Oxford Clay terrain and 
subject to groundwater considerations an ACEC class of AC-4 is adopted for mobile 
groundwater conditions. 
5.9 
Slope Stability 
A number of both small scale and large scale instability features have been noted within the 
Callow and Knotts slopes of the strata in the side walls of the Rookery South pit. The length of 
side wall adjacent to the proposed location of the Generating Equipment Site is however 
formed at slacker angles with a bench of 30m width formed part-way down the slope. Here the 
original pit edges have been modified in the earlier stages of a former restoration programme 
that was not fully implemented. The gradient of the slopes on this face are formed at angles of 
approximately 1V:3H to 1V:2H . The overall profile is formed at approximately 1V:4.5H.  
The results of a survey of the slope condition on motorway earthworks (Perry, 1989) indicates 
that slopes greater than 2.5m high, constructed using material sourced from the Oxford Clay 
Formation, should have a gradient no steeper than 1V:3.5H to limit the risk of slope failure to 
less than 1 per cent within 20 years of construction. Where the slopes are formed at a gradient 
steeper than 1V:3.5H, weathering and progressive softening of the near-surface soils on the 
slope may result in shallow translational and flow movements through the soils near the base 
of the root system of the vegetation on the slope. For slopes at about 1V:2.5H, the risk of such 
failures occurring within about 10 years of construction was reported to be about 20%.

26 
In the western parts of the Generating Equipment Site, the proposed slope gradient as a result 
of the LLRS earthworks will provide a resultant slope gradient equivalent to approximately 
1V:3.5H.  
5.10 Potential for Hydraulic Uplift 
When the piezometric pressure in a relatively permeable stratum exceeds the confining 
overburden pressure of the relatively impermeable strata overlying it, then there is a 
theoretical risk of heave or hydraulic uplift. However, the inherent strength and cohesion of the 
confining strata (rather than just its downward acting mass) can also contribute to the resisting 
downward forces acting against the uplift. Therefore with essentially impermeable deposits 
(remnant Oxford Clay and Callow Clay Fill) overlying slightly more permeable deposits 
(Kellaways Sand), and with relatively high piezometric levels recorded in boreholes around the 
perimeter of the proposed application site, there might be a risk that hydraulic uplift may occur 
in the pit base where the thickness of the overlying impermeable deposits has been reduced 
by excavation works and overburden pressures therefore reduced. It should be noted that 
hydraulic uplift has not occurred in this pit although the theoretical possibility remains. 
Previous groundwater monitoring undertaken at the proposed application site has shown that 
piezometric levels within the Kellaways Sand are at, or close to, the topographic levels 
currently present within the base of the pit. However, the permeability of the Kellaways Sand 
has been shown by historical investigations to be relatively low (2.4 x 10-6 m/s to 5.1 x 10-7 
m/s) and the potential for significant hydraulic pressure to build up is therefore considered to 
be very low. 
Calculations of the potential for basal heave have been undertaken using stratigraphical 
information collected during historical ground investigations undertaken at the proposed 
application site by CL Associates in 2000 (CLA, 2000) and maximum recorded piezometric 
levels based on hydrogeological information collected during groundwater monitoring 
undertaken by CLA between 2000 and 2002 and by PBA in June and September 2008. The 
factor of safety against the potential for heave to occur as a result of piezometric pressures 
within the Kellaways Sand, Cornbrash Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation, has 
been calculated by comparing the uplift pressure from each respective groundwater body, 
measured at boreholes located within the base of the pit, to the vertical overburden pressure 
applied by the overlying deposits based on the proposed basal formation levels at these 
locations. The results show that a factor of safety against basal heave of 1.5 or more is 
present and basal heave is therefore considered unlikely to occur.  
The proposed regrading works included as part of the LLRS will result in a platform at 
approximately 31m AOD – 31.8m AOD. These works will effectively require placement of up 
fill in places but removal of soil in other areas where ground levels are currently slightly higher 
than the proposed platform levels. In general, comparing the depth to the Kellaways Sand 
Formation, recorded during previous ground investigations, with the proposed development 
platform level indicates that the Kellaways Sand will be overlain by approximately 5m – 10m of 
very low permeability in-situ Oxford Clay and re-worked Callow Clay fill and basal heave is 
considered highly unlikely to occur. 
5.11 Surface Water Disposal 
The Oxford Clay and underlying Kellaways Sand are of a very low permeability and there is 
therefore no scope for the use of infiltration drainage within the proposed application site. As a 
result, the LLRS includes development of a surface water attenuation pond and associated 
pumping station in order to control the surface waters within the pits.  
It is understood that the drainage of the proposed application site will be via a series of 
surface water interceptor channels flowing under gravity to the surface water attenuation 
pond. Levels within the attenuation pond will be controlled by stage pumping any accumulated 
waters via an existing culvert into Mill Brook and ultimately Stewartby Lake.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
6.1 
Conclusions 
The Project Site spans several different parts of the Rookery South site, and includes a large 
Electrical Connection area that falls outside the clay pit adjacent to the south of the pit. The 
Generating Equipment Site of the site falls within the southwest corner of the Rookery South 
clay pit that provided clay to the nearby Stewartby brickworks. It is understood that clay 
extraction from this area ceased in 1986. The remaining parts of the Project Site lie to the 
south of the clay pit and comprise agricultural land that forms part of the Electrical Connection 
area. Evidence from historical maps suggests that this land has always been in agricultural 
use. 
From a review of the available desk based information it is likely that Callow Clay Fill in the 
form of reworked clay underlies the base of the clay pit in the Project Site. Indications are that 
this could be in excess of 4.5m deep in some parts although more typically around 2.5m thick. 
Chemical testing data is not available on this from within the actual site area, although records 
from samples taken elsewhere within the wider confines of Rookery South Pit indicate that the 
material is typical of reworked clay with rare inclusions of brick, and consequently this is not 
expected to represent a potential source of contamination.  
With regard to the Electrical Connection area, there are not expected to be any new receptors 
introduced, since the area will only be used to provide a below ground gas and above ground 
electricity Electrical Connection. Furthermore there are not expected to be any notable on-site 
or plausible off-site sources of contamination in this area, potential hazards associated with 
ground contamination have therefore not been identified in this part of the site, and hence the 
risk assessment for this area has not been taken forward.   
Whilst it is possible that the reworked Callow Clay Fill within the base of the clay pit may 
contain isolated, discrete and localised elevated concentrations of potential contaminants, this 
is considered unlikely on the basis of the testing carried out elsewhere on the site. 
Furthermore the low sensitivity of the proposed end-use in this area means that even if any 
localised contamination were present, it is unlikely that any pollutant linkages between the 
end-users and the ground will be active.  
Nevertheless, the presence of Callow Clay fill and the organic rich Oxford Clay Formation 
could represent a possible low level Carbon Dioxide ground gas source that could migrate to 
the ground surface via permeable pathways in the reworked ground, or via anthropogenic 
caused during construction. 
Potential pollutant linkages have been identified within the Generating Equipment Site of the 
site only. Using the information on potential sources (contaminant types), receptors and 
exposure pathways the estimated risks for the identified pollutant linkages have been 
assessed as Very Low in all cases (human health and controlled waters). The exception to 
this is risk associated with naturally occurring ground gas (carbon dioxide) within the 
underlying clay, further investigation will be required to assess this risk, and it should not be 
ruled out that some form of mitigation in the form of gas protection measures may be required. 
It is therefore considered that the site is unlikely to be designated as “contaminated land” 
under Part IIA. 
Possible pollutant linkages have been identified in the Generating Equipment Site and Access 
Road only, but these risks have been assessed to be Very Low. It is considered that the risks 
can be managed and reduced to an acceptable level through a combination of mitigation, 
remediation, design and adoption of good practice measures during construction.

6.2 
Geotechnical Conclusions 
It is recognised that the proposed LLRS will take place prior to commencement of the 
development. The LLRS will include regrading levels within the base of the pit by cut and 
placement of engineered fill, including the winning of lay fill from parts of the wider site area. 
The earthworks in the base of the pit will be undertaken by placing Oxford Clay Fill in layers to 
raise ground levels and produce a fall across the pit towards an attenuation pond in the 
northern part of the Rookery South pit. It is proposed that the resulting topographic levels 
beneath the Generating Equipment Site will be approximately 31.8m AOD – 31.2m AOD, 
which equates to a limited thickness of fill above current levels of circa 0.5m in places and cut 
of up to 1.2m. In the western parts of the Generating Equipment Site, the proposed slope 
gradient as a result of the LLRS earthworks will provide a resultant slope gradient equivalent 
to approximately 1V:3.5H to limit the risk of slope failure to less than 1 per cent within 20 years 
of construction. 
The ground conditions on the proposed application site are, in general, expected to form a 
suitable platform for the construction of proposed facility. For very lightly loaded elements of 
the proposed facility and elements that are able to tolerate differential movements, shallow 
spread footings constructed within the remaining Oxford Clay, and possibly in the overlying 
Callow Clay Fill and engineered development platform fill, could be an appropriate option.  
It should be recognised that the Oxford Clay is known to be sulphate and pyrite bearing and 
can therefore be corrosive to buried concrete. Generally a design sulphate class of DS4 is 
required in Oxford Clay terrain and subject to groundwater considerations an ACEC class of 
AC-4 is adopted for mobile groundwater conditions. 
6.3 
Recommendations 
It is recommended that a Geotechnical Ground Investigation is carried within the Generating 
Equipment Site to inform the foundation design of the proposed infrastructure within the 
Generating Equipment Site of the site. The ground investigation should primarily target the 
parts of the site that fall within the base of the clay pit to ascertain the nature and extent of the 
Callow Clay Fill present. 
Given the anticipated low level of contamination risk throughout the application area and its 
proposed end-use, it is anticipated that the requirement to carry out a bespoke Phase 2 
geoenvironmental intrusive investigation is not required. It is not expected that a ground 
investigation of any type will be required for the Electrical Connection area owing to the lack of 
feasible contamination hazards and receptors within this part of the site.  
It may however be prudent to obtain soil samples for geoenvironmental screening during the 
geotechnical ground investigation in the Generating Equipment Site, and to simultaneously 
install ground gas monitoring standpipes during these works. This should be followed up by a 
robust ground gas monitoring programme. It is expected that any requirement for 
contamination testing be satisfactorily dealt with by planning conditions incorporated in any 
granted Outline Planning Consent. 
It is nevertheless recommended that a programme of groundwater and surface water 
monitoring is carried out for the site to provide information on the current baseline conditions 
prior to construction at the site.

PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision June 2013 
Page 1 of 8 
 
 
1 
Introduction 
This document defines the approach adopted by PBA 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
assessment 
of 
potentially 
contaminated land in England.  The aim is for the 
approach to (i) be systematic and objective, (ii) provide 
for the assessment of uncertainty and (iii) provide a 
rational, consistent, transparent framework.  
 
When preparing our methodology we have made 
reference to various technical guidance documents and 
legislation referenced in Section 7 of which the 
principal documents are Contaminated Land Statutory 
Guidance (Defra 2012) the Model Procedures for the 
Management of Contamination (CLR 11) (EA 2004) 
Contaminated land risk assessment: A guide to good 
practice (C552) (CIRIA 2001) and the National 
Planning Policy Framework (DCLG 2012). 
 
2 
Dealing with Land Contamination 
UK legislation aims to help address the problem of 
historic contamination of land and the risks it can pose 
to people’s health, controlled water and the 
environment by determining if a contaminant linkage 
exists.  This requires the three elements of receptor; 
pathway and source (hazard) to be present.  
 
There are several ways in which land contamination 
can be addressed. For example, voluntarily where 
action is taken independently by landowners, when 
land is developed (or redeveloped) under the planning 
system, during the building control process using 
building regulations, or, forced remediation under the 
Part 2A regime. Other legislative regimes may also 
provide a means of dealing with land contamination 
issues, such as the regimes for waste, water, 
environmental permitting, and environmental damage. 
Further, the law of statutory nuisance may result in 
contaminants being unacceptable to third parties whilst 
not attracting action under Part 2A or other 
environmental legislation. 
 
2.1 
Part 2A 
The Environment Act 1995 introduced Part 2A into the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990.  Part 2A, its 
accompanying regulations and original Statutory 
Guidance came into force in England in April 2000.  
The legislation was extended in August 2006 to include 
radiological hazards. 
 
Revised Statutory Guidance was issued April 2012.  
(Defra 2012) to clarify how the regime should operate.  
 The guidance states that enforcing authorities should 
seek to use Part 2A only where no appropriate 
alternative solution exists. 
 
Part 2A defines contaminated land as “land which 
appears to the Local Authority in whose area it is 
situated to be in such a condition that, by reason of 
substances in, on or under the land that significant 
harm is being caused, or there is a significant 
possibility that such harm could be caused, or pollution 
of controlled waters is being, or likely to be, caused”.   
 
Harm is defined as “harm to the health of living 
organisms or other interference with the ecological 
systems of which they form part, and in the case of 
man, includes harm to his property”.   
 
 
For the purposes of Part 2A, land is contaminated if it 
poses a significant possibility of significant harm 
(SPOSH).   
 
Part 2A provides a means of dealing with unacceptable 
risks posed by land contamination to human health and 
the environment, and under the guidance enforcing 
authorities should seek to find and deal with such land. 
It states that “under Part 2A the starting point should be 
that land is not contaminated land unless there is 
reason to consider otherwise. Only land where 
unacceptable risks are clearly identified, after a risk 
assessment has been undertaken in accordance with 
the Guidance, should be considered as meeting the 
Part 2A definition of contaminated land”. Further the 
guidance makes it clear that “regulatory decisions 
should be based on what is reasonably likely, not what 
is hypothetically possible”. 
 
The overarching objectives of the Government’s policy 
on contaminated land and the Part 2A regime are: 
 
“(a) 
To identify and remove unacceptable risks to  
 human health and the environment. 
(a) 
To seek to ensure that contaminated land is 
made suitable for its current use. 
(b) 
To ensure that the burdens faced by 
individuals, companies and society as a whole 
are 
proportionate, 
manageable 
and 
compatible with the principles of sustainable 
development”. 
 
In accordance with the guidance, the enforcing 
authority may need to decide whether and how to act in 
situations where decisions are not straightforward, and 
where there is uncertainty. “In so doing, the authority 
should use its judgement to strike a reasonable 
balance between: (a) dealing with risks raised by 
contaminants in land and the benefits of remediating 
land to remove or reduce those risks; and (b) the 
potential impacts of regulatory intervention including 
financial costs to whoever will pay for remediation, 
health and environmental impacts of taking action, 
property blight, and burdens on affected people”. The 
authority is required to “take a precautionary approach 
to the risks raised by contamination, whilst avoiding a 
disproportionate approach given the circumstances of 
each case”. The aim is “that the regime produces net 
benefits, taking account of local circumstances”. 
 
The guidance recognises that “normal levels of 
contaminants in soils should not be considered to 
cause land to qualify as contaminated land, unless 
there is a particular reason to consider otherwise”. 
 
Normal levels are quoted as: 
“a)   
natural presence of contaminants’ such as 
from underlying geology ‘that have not been 
shown to pose an unacceptable risk to health 
and the environment 
b)   
…low level diffuse pollution, and common 
human activity…” 
 
Similarly the guidance states that significant pollution of 
controlled waters is required for land to be considered 
contaminated and the “fact that substances are merely 
entering water” or “where discharge from land is not 
discernible at a location immediately downstream” does 
not constitute contaminated land. 
PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision June 2013 
Page 2 of 8 
 
The guidance considers four categorisations to 
establish if land is contaminated by either presenting 
an unacceptable risk to human health or significant 
pollution of controlled waters (Categories 1 and 2) or 
where not (Categories 3 and 4). 
 
Category 1: “unacceptably high probability, supported 
by robust scientific evidence, that significant harm or 
significant pollution would occur”.  These situations can 
arise where similar land or exposures are known or 
strongly suspected to have caused harm. 
 
Category 4: “no risk or that the level of risk is low”.   
These situations can arise where no contaminant 
linkage is established or normal/background levels of 
contaminants are present, or where the exposure from 
soil is only a small proportion of what the receptors may 
be exposed to. 
 
For land that cannot be readily placed into Categories 1 
or 4 further assessment is required.  If there is a 
sufficiently strong case that the risks are of sufficient 
concern to cause significant harm/pollution or have the 
significant possibility of significant harm/pollution the 
land is to be placed into Category 2.  If the concern is 
not met land is considered Category 3. 
 
The technical guidance clearly states that the currently 
published SGV and GAC’s represent “cautious 
estimates of level of contaminants in soils” which 
should be considered “no risk to health or, at most, a 
minimal risk”. These values do not represent the 
boundary between categories 3 and 4 and “should be 
considered to be comfortably within Category 4”. 
 
2.2 
Planning 
The Local Planning Authority (LPA) is responsible for 
the control of development, and in doing so it has a 
duty to take account of all material considerations, 
including contamination.   
Section 11, Paragraph 109 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) (DCLG 2012) states the 
planning system should contribute to and enhance the 
natural and local environment by “preventing both new 
and existing developments from contributing to or being 
put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely 
affected by unacceptable levels of soil, air, water 
pollution” and “remediating and mitigating despoiled, 
degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land, 
where appropriate”.  Paragraphs 120 and 121 describe 
the policy considerations the Government expects LPA 
to have in regard to land affected by contamination 
when preparing policies for development plans and in 
taking decisions on applications. 
For planning purposes, the NPPF requires that the 
assessment of risks arising from contamination and 
remediation requirements should be considered on the 
basis of the current environmental setting, the current 
land use, and the circumstances of its proposed new 
use.   
In most other respects, however, the underlying 
approach to identifying and dealing with risk, and the 
overall policy objective of safeguarding human health 
and the environment, are similar to that outlined in Part 
2A.  
 
However, the level at which contamination is deemed 
to be unacceptable, or, gives rise to adverse effects 
under a planning context has not been identified but is 
envisaged to be more precautionary than the level 
required to detrmine land as contaminated under Part 
2A. 
 
The current SGV and GAC are not considered target 
values for the planning regime.  In paragraph 121 the 
developer is required to ensure that land, after 
development, is not capable of being determined as 
contaminated land under Part 2A of the EPA 1990.  
 
The principal planning objective is to ensure that any 
unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and 
other property and the natural and historical 
environment from the contaminated condition of the 
land are identified so that appropriate action can be 
considered and taken to address those risks.  In order 
to grant a planning permission the Local Planning 
Authority (LPA) has to be satisfied that there is 
sufficient information about the condition of the land, its 
impacts and the availability of viable remedial options. 
NPPF Paragraph 21 states that “planning policies and 
decisions should also ensure that adequate site 
investigation information, prepared by a competent 
person, is presented”. Site investigation information is 
further defined in the NPPF Glossary page 56 and that 
also states that investigations should be carried out in 
accordance with established procedures, including 
BS10175 (BSI 2011) that in turn links procedure to the 
requirements of CLR11. 
 
2.3 
Building Control 
The building control department of the local authority 
(along with the private sector approved inspectors) are 
responsible for the operation and enforcement of the 
Building Regulations 2010 (DCLG 2010) to protect the 
health, safety and welfare of people in and around 
buildings and Building Control Regulations Approved 
Document C.  Specifically requires the protection of 
buildings and associated land from the effects of 
contamination, to be applied (non-exclusively) in all 
changes of use from commercial or industrial premises, 
to residential property. 
3 
Approach 
CLR 11 recommends a phased or tiered approach to 
risk assessment with the three tiers being:- 
 
Tier 1 - preliminary – a qualitative assessment 
forming part of a Phase 1 report,  
 
Tier 2 - generic - a quantitative assessment using 
published criteria to screen site specific ground 
condition data forming part of a Phase 2 report 
 
Tier 3 - detailed – a quantitative assessment 
involving 
the 
generation 
of 
site 
specific 
assessment criteria 
 
Each tier of risk assessment comprises the following 
four stages:- 
 
1. 
Hazard Identification – identifying potential 
contaminant sources on and off site; 
2. 
Hazard Assessment – assessing the potential for 
unacceptable risks by identifying what pathways 
and receptors could be present, and what pollutant 
linkages could result (forming the Conceptual Site 
Model (CSM)); 
 
PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision June 2013 
Page 3 of 8 
 
3. 
Risk Estimation – estimating the magnitude and 
probability of the possible consequences (what 
degree of harm might result to a defined receptor 
and how likely); and 
 
4. 
Risk Evaluation – evaluating whether the risk 
needs to be, and can be, managed.   
 
A PBA Phase 1 report normally comprises a desk 
study, walkover and Tier 1 risk assessment (the project 
specific offer defines the actual scope of work). This is 
the minimum requirement as defined by the NPPF, 
pp56. At Tier 1 the PBA approach to risk estimation 
involves identifying the magnitude of the potential 
consequence (taking into account both the potential 
severity of the hazard and the sensitivity of the 
receptor) and the magnitude of the likelihood i.e. the 
probability (taking into account the presence of the 
hazard and the receptor and the integrity of the 
pathway).  This approach is promoted in current 
guidance such as R&D 66 (NHBC 2008). 
 
The PBA approach is that if a pollution linkage is 
identified then it represents a potential risk which 
requires 
further 
consideration 
and 
either 
(1) 
remediation / direct risk management or (2) further tiers 
of assessment.   
 
A PBA preliminary Phase 2 report comprises an 
intrusive 
investigation 
to 
collect 
site 
specific 
information, a Tier 2 quantitative generic risk 
assessment and a refinement of the CSM using the site 
specific data.  Depending on the findings further 
investigation and/or progression to Tier 3 risk 
assessment and the generation of site specific 
assessment criteria may be required. 
 
The PBA methodology provides an estimate of the level 
of risk, it does not identify a risk level at which the risk 
is considered “significant” and/or “unacceptable” as this 
is dependant on the view of the individual / stakeholder. 
For example; to a risk adverse stakeholder even a risk 
level of “very low” may be considered unacceptable 
and as such this stakeholder may require risk 
management options to be implemented. 
 
4 
Identification of Pollutant Linkages and 
Conceptual Site Model (CSM) 
For all Tiers the underlying principle to ground condition 
assessment is the identification of pollutant linkages in 
order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of 
contamination could potentially lead to harmful 
consequences.  A pollutant linkage consists of the 
following three elements:- 
 
• 
A source/hazard – a substance or situation which 
has the potential to cause harm or pollution; 
 
• 
A pathway – a means by which the hazard moves 
along / generates exposure; and 
 
• 
A receptor/target – an entity which is vulnerable to 
the potential adverse effects of the hazard. 
 
The Conceptual Site Model identifies the types and 
locations of potential contaminant sources/hazards and 
potential 
receptors 
and 
potential 
migration/transportation pathway(s).  The CSM is 
refined as the assessment progresses through the 
Tiers. 
4.1 
Hazard Identification  
 
A hazard is a substance or situation that has the 
potential to cause harm.  Hazards may be chemical, 
biological or physical (e.g. explosive gases).   
 
At Tier 1 the potential for hazards to be present is 
determined from consideration of the previous or 
ongoing activities on or near to the site in accordance 
with the criteria presented in the Table 1.  
 
Based on the land use information Potential 
Contaminants of Concern (PCOC) are identified.  The 
PCOC direct the scope of the collection of site specific 
data and the analytical testing selected for subsequent 
Tiers. 
 
At Tier 2 the site specific data is screened using 
published assessment criteria (refer to PBA document 
entitled Rationale for the Selection of Tier 2 
Assessment Criteria).  In general, published criteria 
have been developed using highly conservative 
assumptions and therefore if the screening criterion is 
not exceeded then the PCOC is eliminated as a 
potential Hazard.  It should be noted that exceedance 
does not necessarily indicate that a site is 
contaminated and/or unsuitable for use only that the 
PCOC is retained as a potential Hazard.  Published 
criteria are generated using models based on 
numerous and complex assumptions.  Whether or not 
these assumptions are appropriate in a site-specific 
context requires confirmation on a project by project 
basis and would form part of a Tier 3 assessment. 
 
When reviewing or assessing site specific data PBA 
utilise published guidance on comparing contamination 
data with a critical concentration (CL:AIRE/CIEH 2008) 
which presents a structured process for employing 
statistical techniques for data assessment purposes.  
The benefit of the statistical tool is uncertainty is 
quantified and decisions are made knowing the 
strength of the evidence.  Correct decision probability is 
a function of sample size, difference in the mean and 
the critical concentration, variation in measured values 
and the significance level. 
 
4.2 
Receptor and Pathway Identification 
For all Tiers the potential receptors (for both on site and 
adjoining land) that will be considered are: 
• 
Human Health – including current and future 
occupiers, construction and future maintenance 
workers, and neighbouring properties/third parties;  
• 
Ecological systems; *1 
• 
Controlled waters *2 – including surface water and 
groundwater; 
• 
Property, Animal or Crop (existing or proposed) - 
including buildings, service lines and pipes, crops, 
livestock, pets, woodland; and 
• 
Archaeological sites and ancient monuments. 
 
*1 International or nationally designated sites (as defined in the 
statutory guidance (Defra Circular 04/12)) “in the local area” will 
be identified as potential ecological receptors.  A search radius 
of 1, 2 or 5km will be utilised depending on the site specific 
circumstances (see also pathway identification). The 
Environment Agency has published an ecological risk 
assessment framework (EA 2008) which promotes (as opposed 
to statutorily enforces) consideration of additional receptors to 
include locally protected sites and protected or notable species. 
These additional potential receptors will only be considered if a 
Phase 1 habitat survey, undertaken in accordance with 
PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision June 2013 
Page 4 of 8 
 
guidance (JNCC 1993), is commissioned and the data provided 
to PBA.  It should be noted that without such a survey the Tier 
1 risk assessment may conclude that the identification of 
potential 
ecological 
receptors 
is 
inconclusive 
(see 
Specification). 
 
*2 the definition of “pollution of controlled water” was amended 
by the introduction of Section 86 of the Water Act 2003.  For 
the purposes of Part 2A groundwater does not include waters 
above the saturated zone and our assessment does not 
therefore 
address perched water other than where 
development causes a pathway to develop. 
 
If a receptor is taken forward for further assessment it 
will be classified in terms of its sensitivity, the criteria 
for which are presented in Table 2.  Table 2 has been 
generated using descriptions of environmental receptor 
importance/value given in various guidance documents 
including R&D 66 (NHBC 2008) and Transport Analysis 
Guidance (based on DETR 2000). Human health and 
buildings classifications have been generated by PBA 
using the attribute description for each class. 
 
The exposure pathway and modes of transport that will 
be considered are presented in Table 3. 
 
4.3 
Note regarding Ecological Systems  
The Environment Agency (EA) has developed an 
ecological risk assessment framework which aims to 
provide a structured approach for assessing the risks to 
ecology from chemical contaminants in soils (EA 2008). 
In circumstances where contaminants in water 
represent a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems then 
risk assessors will need to consider this separately.  
 
The framework consists of a three tiered process:- 
 
• 
Tier 1 is a screening step where the site soils 
chemical data is compared to a soil screening 
value (SSV) 
• 
Tier 2 uses various tools (including surveys and 
biological testing) to gather evidence for any harm 
to the ecological receptors 
• 
Tier 3 seeks to attribute the harm to the chemical 
contamination 
 
Tier 1 is preceded by a desk study to collate 
information about the site and the nature of the 
contamination to assess whether pollutant linkages are 
feasible.  The framework presents ten steps for 
ecological desk studies and development of a 
conceptual site model as follows.   
 
1 Establish Regulatory Context 
2 Collate and Assess Documentary Information 
3 Summarise Documentary Information 
4 Identify Potential Contaminants of Concern 
5 Identify Likely Fate Transport of Contaminants 
6 Identify Potential Receptors of Concern 
7 Identify Potential Pathways of Concern 
8 Create a Conceptual Site Model 
9 Identify Assessment and Measurement Endpoints 
10 Identify Gaps and Uncertainties 
 
The information in a standard PBA Phase 1 report 
covers Steps 1 to 4 inclusive.  Step 5 considers fate 
and transport of contaminants and it should be noted 
that our standard report adopts a simplified approach 
considering only transport mechanisms.  A simplified 
approach has also been adopted in respect of Steps 6 
and 7 receptors (a detailed review of the ecological 
attributes has not been undertaken) and pathways (a 
food chain assessment has not been undertaken). 
Step 9 is outside the scope of our standard Phase 1 
report. 
 
The Tier 1 prepared by PBA as part of a Phase 1 report 
will assess the viability of the mode of transport given 
the site specific circumstances not specific pathways.  
As with receptor identification it should be noted that 
without a habitat survey the Tier 1 risk assessment may 
conclude that the risk to potential ecological receptors 
is inconclusive (see PBA Specification for Phase 1 
Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land). 
 
4.4 
Note regarding Water Framework Directive 
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000) aims to 
protect and enhance the quality of surface freshwater, 
groundwaters and dependent eco systems, estuaries 
and coastal waters.  The WFD was transposed into UK 
law in 2003 (Statutory Instruments 2003).  Member 
states must aim to reach good chemical and ecological 
status as defined in the Directive by 2015. 
 
To address the WFD, a River Basin Management Plan 
(RBMP) has been developed for the 11 River Basin 
Districts in England and Wales.  These were released 
by Defra in 2009 (Defra 2009). 
 
These RBMP’s establish the current status of waters 
within the catchments of the respective Districts and 
the current status of adjoining waters identified.  As part 
of a Tier 2 risk assessment water quality data is 
screened against the WFD assessment criteria. 
Compare to the RBMP’s current status of waters for the 
catchment under consideration would form part of a 
Tier 3 assessment. 
 
5 
Risk Estimation 
Risk estimation classifies what degree of harm might 
result to a receptor (defined as consequence) and how 
likely it is that such harm might arise (probability).   
At Tier 1 the consequence classification is generated 
by multiplying the hazard classification score and the 
receptor sensitivity score.  This approach follows that 
presented in the republished R&D 66 (NHBC 2008).   
 
The criteria for classifying probability are set out in 
Table 4 and have been taken directly from Table 6.4 
CIRIA C552 (CIRIA 2001).  Probability considers the 
integrity of the exposure pathway. 
 
The consequence classifications detailed in Table 5 
have been adapted from Table 6.3 presented in C552 
and R&D 66 (Annex 4 Table A4.3). 
 
The Tier 1 risk classification is estimated for each 
pollutant linkage using the matrix given in Table 6 
which is taken directly from C552 (Table 6.5). 
Subsequent Tiers refine the CSM through retention or 
elimination of potential hazards and pollutant linkages.   
 
6 
Risk Evaluation 
In order to put the Tier 1 risk classification into context 
the likely actions are described in Table 7 which is 
taken directly from C552 (Table 6.6). Subsequent Tiers 
identify potential risk management options through 
remediation and/or mitigation measures.

Table 4: Classification of Probability 
Classification 
Definition 
High likelihood 
There is a pollution linkage and an event either appears very likely in the short-term and almost 
inevitable over the long-term, or there is already evidence at the receptor of harm / pollution. 
Likely 
There is a pollution linkage and all the elements are present and in the right place, which means that 
it is probable that an event will occur.  Circumstances are such that an event is not inevitable, but 
possible in the short-term and likely over the long-term. 
Low likelihood 
There is a pollution linkage and circumstances are possible under which an event could occur.  
However, it is by no means certain that even over a longer period such event would take place, and 
is less likely in the shorter-term. 
Unlikely 
There is a pollution linkage but circumstances are such that it is improbable that an event would 
occur even in the very long-term.

Table 7: Description of Risks and Likely Action Required 
Risk Classification 
Description 
Very high risk 
There is a high probability that severe harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified 
hazard, OR, there is evidence that severe harm to a designated receptor is currently happening.  
This risk, if realised, is likely to result in a substantial liability. Urgent investigation (if not undertaken 
already) and remediation is likely to be required in the short term. 
High risk 
Harm is likely to arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard.  Realisation of the risk is 
likely to present a substantial liability. 
Urgent investigation (if not undertaken already) is required and remedial works may be necessary in 
the short-term and are likely over the longer-term. 
Moderate risk 
It is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard.  However, it is 
either relatively unlikely that any such harm would be severe, or if any harm were to occur it is more 
likely that the harm would be relatively mild. 
Investigation (if not already undertaken) is normally required to clarify the risk and to determine the 
potential liability.  Some remedial works may be required in the longer-term. 
Low risk 
It is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard, but it is likely 
that this harm, if realised, would at worst normally be mild. 
Very low risk 
There is a low possibility that harm could arise to a receptor.  In the event of such harm being 
realised it is not likely to be severe.

Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Introduction
Copyright Notice
 
 
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which contamination could spread, and to the 
vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment Agency and the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights 
hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is 
produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements with a number of Data 
Suppliers.

Published 1883 - 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Published 1990
Source map scale - 1:10,000
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

10k Raster Mapping
Published 2006
Source map scale - 1:10,000
The historical maps shown were produced from the Ordnance Survey`s 
1:10,000 colour raster mapping. These maps are derived from Landplan 
which replaced the old 1:10,000 maps originally published in 1970. The data 
is highly detailed showing buildings, fences and field boundaries as well as all
roads, tracks and paths. Road names are also included together with the 
relevant road number and classification. Boundary information depiction 
includes county, unitary authority, district, civil parish and constituency.

VectorMap Local
Published 2014
Source map scale - 1:10,000
VectorMap Local (Raster) is Ordnance Survey's highest detailed 'backdrop' 
mapping product. These maps are produced from OS's VectorMap Local, a 
simple vector dataset at a nominal scale of 1:10,000, covering the whole of 
Great Britain, that has been designed for creating graphical mapping. OS 
VectorMap Local is derived from large-scale information surveyed at 1:1250 
scale (covering major towns and cities),1:2500 scale (smaller towns, villages 
and developed rural areas), and 1:10 000 scale (mountain, moorland and 
river estuary areas).

Published 1976
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1883
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250

Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Introduction
Copyright Notice
 
 
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which contamination could spread, and to the 
vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment Agency and the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights 
hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is 
produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements with a number of Data 
Suppliers.

Introduction

Peter Brett Associates Copyright Notice
Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Published 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Published 2006
Source map scale - 1:10,000
The historical maps shown were produced from the Ordnance Survey`s 
1:10,000 colour raster mapping. These maps are derived from Landplan 
which replaced the old 1:10,000 maps originally published in 1970. The data 
is highly detailed showing buildings, fences and field boundaries as well as all
roads, tracks and paths. Road names are also included together with the 
relevant road number and classification. Boundary information depiction 
includes county, unitary authority, district, civil parish and constituency.

Published 2014
Source map scale - 1:10,000
VectorMap Local (Raster) is Ordnance Survey's highest detailed 'backdrop' 
mapping product. These maps are produced from OS's VectorMap Local, a 
simple vector dataset at a nominal scale of 1:10,000, covering the whole of 
Great Britain, that has been designed for creating graphical mapping. OS 
VectorMap Local is derived from large-scale information surveyed at 1:1250 
scale (covering major towns and cities),1:2500 scale (smaller towns, villages 
and developed rural areas), and 1:10 000 scale (mountain, moorland and 
river estuary areas).

SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1883
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Information
Published 1976
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

The SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's `Survey of Information on Microfilm') are 
further, minor editions of mapping which were produced and published in 
between the main editions as an area was updated. They date from 1947 to 
1994, and contain detailed information on buildings, roads and land-use. 
These maps were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Introduction
Copyright Notice
 
 
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which contamination could spread, and to the 
vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment Agency and the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights 
hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is 
produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements with a number of Data 
Suppliers.

Introduction
Copyright Notice

Peter Brett Associates Copyright Notice
Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Published 1883 - 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

VectorMap Local (Raster) is Ordnance Survey's highest detailed 'backdrop' 
mapping product. These maps are produced from OS's VectorMap Local, a 
simple vector dataset at a nominal scale of 1:10,000, covering the whole of 
Great Britain, that has been designed for creating graphical mapping. OS 
VectorMap Local is derived from large-scale information surveyed at 1:1250 
scale (covering major towns and cities),1:2500 scale (smaller towns, villages 
and developed rural areas), and 1:10 000 scale (mountain, moorland and 
river estuary areas).

Published 1883
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1883
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Client Details
For ease of identification, your site and buffer have been split into Slices, 
Segments and Quadrants.  These are illustrated on the Index Map opposite 
and explained further below.
Each slice represents a 1:10,000 plot area (2.7km x 2.7km) for your site and 
buffer.  A large site and buffer may be made up of several slices (represented
by a red outline), that are referenced by letters of the alphabet, starting from 
the bottom left corner of the slice "grid". This grid does not relate to National 
Grid lines but is designed to give best fit over the site and buffer.
A segment represents a 1:2,500 plot area.  Segments that have plot files 
associated with them are shown in dark green, others in light blue.  These are
numbered from the bottom left hand corner within each slice.
A quadrant is a quarter of a segment.  These are labelled as NW, NE, SW, 
SE and are referenced in the datasheet to allow features to be quickly located
on plots.  Therefore a feature that has a quadrant reference of A7NW will be 
in Slice A, Segment 7 and the NW Quadrant.

Introduction

Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Risk estimation establishes the magnitude and probability of the possible consequences (what degree of harm might result and how likely). 
The criteria for classifying probability and consequence are set out in Tables 3 and 4 of the PBA methodology.

**Note : A layout of the gas processing plant has been modelled using several coloured ‘development envelopes’ related to the height, width and depth of each part 
of the plant ( shown in the plan above ).  The envelopes are modelled at the maximum height of the structures or buildings within each area and therefore represent a 
worse case scenario, showing the area in which development of the gas processing structures will be built.  Indicative wireline models of the proposed transmission 
towers are shown and a 3D model of the Covanta RRF consented scheme is included in the photomontages.  Areas with taller stacks have been modelled with 
cylinders rising out of the development blocks in order to illustrate the proposed position of the turbine generator stacks. These envelopes have been used as the 
basis for visual modelling in the photomontages and the assessment of impacts.  Colours are used to illustrate the different development envelopes and are not 
indicative of the colour of the plant.  The actual colours of gas processing plant and buildings will be agreed with the Local Planning Authority to help minimise the 
visual impact of the development.  Photomontages do not illustrate any planting which may be incorporated to further reduce the visibility of the Project..

**Note : A layout of the gas processing plant has been modelled using several coloured ‘development envelopes’ related to the height, width and depth of each part of 
the plant ( shown in the plan Figure 2 ).  The envelopes are modelled at the maximum height of the structures or buildings within each area and therefore represent a 
worse case scenario, showing the area in which development of the gas processing structures will be built.  Indicative wireline models of the proposed transmission 
towers are shown and a 3D model of the Covanta RRF consented scheme is included in the photomontages.  Areas with taller stacks have been modelled with 
cylinders rising out of the development blocks in order to illustrate the proposed position of the turbine generator stacks. These envelopes have been used as the 
basis for visual modelling in the photomontages and the assessment of impacts.  Colours are used to illustrate the different development envelopes and are not 
indicative of the colour of the plant.  The actual colours of gas processing plant and buildings will be agreed with the Local Planning Authority to help minimise the 
visual impact of the development.  Photomontages do not illustrate any planting which may be incorporated to further reduce the visibility of the Project.
