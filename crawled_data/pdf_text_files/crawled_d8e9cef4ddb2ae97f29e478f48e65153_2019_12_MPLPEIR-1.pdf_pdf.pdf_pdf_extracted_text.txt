Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document sets out preliminary environmental information relating to the 
Millbrook Power Project (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project’). It has been 
prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power 
Limited (MPL), (the "Applicant").  
1.1.2 
The Project is proposed at the former clay extraction pit at Rookery South, 
near Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the approximate centre of the Project Site 
at grid reference 501373, 240734.  The boundary of the Project Site falls 
within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council 
(BBC) areas.  The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project (NSIP) pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 and therefore requires 
development consent under that Act. The Applicant intends to apply for a 
development consent order ("DCO") for the Project in Q1 2015. The DCO 
process is described further in Section 1.3 of this PEIR.  
1.1.3 
The location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1. 
1.1.4 
Terms referred to below using capital letters are defined in the Project 
glossary set out in Appendix 1 of this document. 
1.1.5 
The Project would comprise: 
� 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The Power 
Generation Plant comprises: 
 
generating equipment including up to five gas turbine generators, up to five 
exhaust gas flue stacks  and balance of plant, which are located within the 
Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment"); 
 
A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the "Access Road");  
 
A temporary construction compound required during construction only (the 
"Laydown Area"); 
� 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS)  (the "Gas Connection"); 
and 
� 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the "Electrical Connection"). 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report

1.1.6 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site  
1.1.7 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’ and are 
all integral to the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that 
electricity to the NETS. The land upon which the Project would be developed, 
or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the 
Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’ The Project is described in more 
detail in Section 2, including the options currently under consideration for the 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. 
1.1.8 
The Project Site and all elements of the Project listed above are shown on 
Figure 1.2.  
1.1.9 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former 
clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, with the Gas and Electrical Connections 
extending from The Rookery into adjacent agricultural land. 
1.1.10 The Rookery, which comprises the Rookery North and Rookery South Pits, is 
currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by 
the landowner which includes works to re-profile and level the base of the pit 
together with drainage and attenuation works and structural planting. Once 
the works have been completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 15 
m below the surrounding ground level.  Details of the works are described in 
section 2.1. 
1.2 
Purpose and Structure of the PEIR 
1.2.1 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the EIA Regulations) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of any 
development listed in Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 1 
development”). EIA is also required for development listed in Schedule 2 to 
the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 2 development”) if it is likely to have 
significant effects on the environment. 
1.2.2 
The definition of a Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating 
stations with a heat output of 300 MW or more (Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a)). 
1.2.3 
The thermal output of the Project will be greater than 300 MW and therefore 
an EIA for the Project will be required under the EIA regulations. 
1.2.4 
Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations, the Applicant is required to 
set out how it intends to publicise and consult on preliminary environmental 
information relating to the Project. Regulation 2 of the EIA Regulations then 
defines preliminary environmental information as being the environmental 
information that has been compiled by the Applicant and which is reasonably 
required to assess the environmental effects of the development.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report

1.2.5 
In the case of the Project, information has been compiled into this document 
(the "PEIR") which presents the environmental information collected to date 
and an assessment, on a preliminary basis, of the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project. 
1.2.6 
This PEIR has been prepared in discrete sections to allow the reader to 
understand the Project, the purpose of this document, the regulatory 
framework in which it has been prepared, and the methodologies and 
preliminary findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). 
1.2.7 
The PEIR is set out as follows: 
� 
Section 1 comprises a brief description of the Project, an introduction to 
the consenting regime, a description of the Applicant and the need for and 
benefits of the Project; 
� 
Section 2 provides a description of the Project Site and surrounding area, 
and includes a more detailed description of the Power Generation Plant, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
� 
Section 3 provides a brief description of the planning policy background 
and regulatory framework in which the PEIR has been prepared; 
� 
Section 4 provides a description of the methodologies employed in 
undertaking the EIA for the Project; 
� 
Section 5 provides a description of alternatives which have been 
considered; and 
� 
Sections 6 to 15 provide a description of the environmental information 
which has been gathered to date under specific environmental topics, the 
preliminary findings of the assessment as well as details of the next steps 
required to complete the EIA. 
1.3 
Application for Development Consent  
1.3.1 
In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is considered 
to be a nationally significant infrastructure project (NSIP) under the Planning 
Act 2008 (PA 2008) if it has a capacity of more than 50 MW. As the Project 
would have a rated electrical output of at least 50 MW, and up to 299 MW, it 
would be classified as an NSIP under Section 14(1)(a) and Section 15(2) of 
the PA 2008. Under Section 31 of the PA 2008, consent is required for 
development that is or forms part of an NSIP and therefore a Development 
Consent Order (DCO) application must be made to the Secretary of State 
(SoS) for the Project. 
1.3.2 
Development consent for an NSIP may only be granted by an application 
made under Section 37 of the PA 2008 to the SoS. Section 37 of the PA 2008 
(and associated legislation) also governs the content of a DCO Application, 
including requirements for certain accompanying documents. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
4 
1.3.3 
These requirements are specified, in particular, in the Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (the 
“APFP Regulations”). The APFP Regulations require that a DCO Application, 
where applicable, includes an environmental statement (ES). As such, an ES 
for the Project will be submitted as part of the suite of documents that will 
accompany the DCO Application for the Project in Q1 2015. 
1.4 
Consultation Strategy 
1.4.1 
This PEIR has been compiled in order to assist the Applicant to consult upon 
its DCO Application for the Project by providing preliminary environmental 
information about the Project. Pre-application consultation is a requirement 
under s42, s47 and s48 of the PA 2008. This PEIR has been published in the 
manner described in the Applicant's Statement of Community Consultation 
(SoCC), which explains how the Applicant proposes to consult people living in 
the vicinity of the Project, as required by s47 of the PA 2008. The SoCC also 
explains how feedback can be given about the Project and the content of this 
PEIR. 
1.4.2 
This PEIR is intended to provide an assessment, on a preliminary basis, of 
the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The DCO 
Application for the Project is still being developed and refined. In particular, 
decisions are still to be made on the Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection. Feedback received during the 
consultation process will help inform the development of the Project and the 
decisions on its design still to be made. The ES that is submitted with the 
DCO Application in Q1 2015 will assess the refined Project, following 
consultation, that is the subject of the DCO Application. As such, details 
about the Project may alter between the publication of the PEIR and the ES. 
An assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project as 
at the point of submission of the DCO Application will be provided via the ES.  
1.4.3 
All representations made during the consultation process will be considered 
carefully and the Applicant will have regard to all relevant responses prior to 
submission of the DCO Application. The outputs generated from statutory and 
non-statutory consultation will be summarised in a consultation report, 
submitted alongside the DCO Application. This document will also 
demonstrate how the Applicant has had regard to relevant consultation 
responses received. 
1.4.4 
At the start of the EIA process, the Applicant requested a Scoping Opinion 
from the SoS. This request was made on the 20th June 2014, and was 
supported by a Scoping Report (available on both the Applicant’s website 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk 
and 
the 
Planning 
Inspectorate’s 
website 
http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/eastern/millbrook-power/). 
1.4.5 
A Scoping Opinion was subsequently issued by the SoS and this is also 
available on the Applicant’s website and the Planning Inspectorate’s website. 
The EIA process and this PEIR take the Scoping Opinion and the consultation 
responses provided by the SoS into account.

The Applicant 
1.5.1 
MPL is an energy development company established for the Project by Watt 
Power Limited (WPL). 
1.5.2 
WPL has been established to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to 
support the UK Government's drive to a low carbon economy. Stag Energy 
provides resources to WPL through a management services agreement with 
WPL. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth 
of experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW 
of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of 
which 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
1.5.3 
WPL currently has three other projects up to 299 MW being brought forward 
through the PA 2008 process. They are: Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in 
Suffolk (www.progresspower.co.uk), Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South 
Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk) and Abergelli Power Ltd at Abergelli in 
South Wales (www.abergellipower.co.uk). Progress Power Ltd and Hirwaun 
Power Ltd's projects are now both in the examination phase following 
acceptance of the applications for these two NSIPs by the Planning 
Inspectorate in Spring 2014. Abergelli Power Ltd will submit an application for 
its NSIP to the Planning Inspectorate for examination in Q1 2015.  
1.5.4 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to the Gateway Storage Company 
Ltd, which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage facility in the 
East Irish Sea. The project has been consented by the UK Government, the 
Marine Management Organisation and the local planning authority (Barrow-in-
Furness Borough Council, Cumbria). Further information on the project is 
available at www.gatewaystorage.co.uk. 
1.5.5 
WPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.  MPL recognises the need to 
balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and concerns 
relating to energy projects and believes this balance can be responsibly 
delivered. The Project will be designed and developed to high quality safety 
and environmental standards. 
1.5.6 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk or http://www.wattpowerltd.co.uk. 
1.6 
Needs and Benefits of the Project 
1.6.1 
There is considerable national need for this type of development, 
acknowledged at all levels of Government policy. National planning policy 
supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the current ageing 
and inevitable closure of older fossil fuel and nuclear power plants and the 
likely increase in demand for electricity over the coming decades. 
1.6.2 
The overarching National Policy Statement (NPS) for Energy (NPS EN-1) re-
affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, confirms that a diverse 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
6 
energy mix is required and that there is a significant need for new energy 
generation infrastructure to replace capacity that will be lost through the 
closure of existing fossil fuel and nuclear plant. Indeed it states that the 
decision-maker ‘should start with a presumption in favour of granting consent 
to applications for energy NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2). 
1.6.3 
NPS EN-1 also states that ‘gas will continue to play an important role in the 
electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of 
low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply’ (paragraph 3.6.2). 
1.6.4 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project provide back-up 
to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which 
is an increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas-fired 
power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity 
power generation. 
1.6.5 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to the 
nature of the electricity generation mix on the NETS. There is therefore a 
clear and significant requirement for further capacity to meet the projected 
need for reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated gas fired peaking plant such 
as the Project could allow for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to the 
NETS, thus playing a role in meeting the energy requirements of the UK 
going forward. 
1.6.6 
Section 3.7 of NPS EN-1 sets out the need case for new electricity network 
infrastructure. 
1.6.7 
Paragraph 3.7.10 states that ‘there is an urgent need for new electricity 
transmission and distribution infrastructure (and in particular for new lines of 
132 kV and above) to be provided. The [SoS] should consider that the need 
for any given proposed new connection or reinforcement has been 
demonstrated if it represents an efficient and economical means of 
connecting a new generating station to the transmission or distribution 
network, or reinforcing the network to ensure that it is sufficiently resilient and 
has sufficient capacity (in the light of any performance standards set by 
Ofgem) to supply current or anticipated future levels of demand’. 
1.6.8 
In the second Annual Energy Statement (AES) (November, 2011), the 
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) noted the need to build 
new power generation infrastructure. In line with this need, DECC 
acknowledged the need for gas to continue to feature strongly in the energy 
mix, and also stated that while it is important that businesses play their part in 
the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is also important to remain 
competitive. 
1.6.9 
This position is also supported by the more recent Gas Generation Strategy, 
released by DECC in December 2012. It states that “Gas currently forms an 
integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is a reliable, flexible source of 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
7 
electricity. Using gas as a fuel in our power stations currently provides a 
significant proportion of our electricity generation (around 40% in 2011)”.

Project and Site Description 
2.1 
Site Description 
The Rookery 
2.1.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connections would be situated on land within former clay pits known as ‘The 
Rookery’, covering an area of some 210 ha, and situated in the Marston Vale 
between Milton Keynes and Bedford, approximately 3 km north-west of 
Ampthill, and 7 km south west of Bedford.  
2.1.2 
The Rookery is situated within a post-industrial landscape, which is presently 
undergoing significant change. It comprises two large former clay pits, 
Rookery North and Rookery South Pits, separated by an east-west spine of 
unexcavated clay. The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts 
of the Access Road and Gas and Electrical Connections would be located 
within Rookery South Pit which is approximately 95 ha and is bound by steep 
clay banks that are varied in nature and substrate. The pit base, which is the 
subject of the LLRS, currently includes open water, reed beds, pools and bare 
inundated clay.  The land that remains at the original ground level, 
approximately 42 m above ordnance datum (AOD) immediately around the 
periphery of Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground that has been 
cleared of vegetation. Part of the Access Road would lie within Rookery North 
Pit.  
2.1.3 
The Gas and Electrical Connections would extend from Rookery South Pit 
into farmland to the south and/or east as shown on Figure 1.2. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.1.4 
The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing LLRS being undertaken by the 
landowner.  This was the subject of a separate planning permission and 
would be taking place regardless of the Applicant's proposals for the Project. 
The objective of the LLRS is to restore the former clay workings to low grade 
agriculture. This would be achieved through the restoration of The Rookery at 
a low level (i.e. below pre-excavation ground levels), with measures included 
in the restoration to enhance biodiversity and landscape. 
2.1.5 
The LLRS works for Rookery South Pit comprise:

� 
A landscape strategy to include planting on the site boundary and the 
margins of the attenuation pond;  
� 
Provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to 
ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through 
excavation; 
� 
Provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North 
Pit which connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along 
the western side of Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp and existing 
track are both of an agricultural standard; and 
� 
Provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery South 
Pit from the south side of the pit with Station Lane, nr Millbrook Station.     
2.1.6 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, 
will be undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms part of 
the existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not historically 
been subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will provide 
material for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to 
Rookery South Pit together with the implementation of a landscape and 
ecology strategy, which will integrate with ecological mitigation works and 
strategic landscape planting in Rookery North Pit.  
2.1.7 
The LLRS works are independent from the Project proposals and will be 
completed prior to the commencement of construction works, with the 
possible exception of buttressing and re-profiling to the eastern side of the pit. 
2.1.8 
Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be 
approximately 15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the 
Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area. 
2.1.9 
A five year option agreement, which is extendable to seven under certain 
conditions, has been put in place between the Applicant and the landowner of 
Rookery Pit. Included in the agreement is a clause which ensures that the 
elements of the LLRS as set out above and in Section 2.6 of this PEIR will be 
completed prior to the development of the Project. The completion of these 
works has been factored in to the Applicant's preliminary assessment as 
presented in Sections 6-14.  
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.10 Road access to the Power Generation Plant Site is currently from the north 
near Stewartby via the A421, Bedford Road and Green Lane, as shown on 
Figure 1.2. There is a junction on Green Lane leading to an access track 
which extends southwards into Rookery South Pit and the Generating 
Equipment Site. The Gas and Electrical Connections would either be primarily 
accessed from Junction 13 of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton 
Lane, Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road, from Bedford Road, via 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
10 
Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road and Millbrook Road or  from 
the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards for 
approximately 7 km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route as 
Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road. This road network is shown on Figure 12.1 and 12.2.  
2.1.11 There are overhead power lines that run west to east south of Rookery South 
Pit. Furthermore, a number of existing public footpaths are located in and 
around the Project Site, linking it to the wider Marston Vale. However, there is 
limited public access to Rookery South Pit itself. 
2.1.12 The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western 
flank of Rookery South Pit whilst a tributary watercourse, passing to the south 
of Rookery South Pit within the Project Site, joins Mill Brook in the vicinity of 
South Pillinge Farm. Further detail is provided in Section 9 and shown on 
Figure 9.1. 
2.1.13 Substantial areas of land around Stewartby, including The Rookery, have 
been previously worked for clay that was used in Stewartby Brickworks until it 
closed in 2008. To the north of The Rookery there remain some buildings 
associated with the former Stewartby Brickworks, including four chimneys 
which are now listed structures. Following clay extraction, these former clay 
working sites have been restored (to varying levels of completion) by different 
means (including the disposal of waste) and to different uses, including water 
based recreation and commercial uses. 
2.1.14 Furthermore, significant regeneration and development is allocated for the 
Northern Marston Vale Growth Area, in which the Project Site is located. This 
will result in further change within the landscape, not least represented by 
substantial residential and employment development such as in the nearby 
settlements of Marston Moretaine and Stewartby. 
2.1.15 The Gas and Electrical Connection would be located largely outside of 
Rookery South Pit, are located in a less dynamic landscape set within a 
mostly undeveloped agricultural landscape which includes areas of woodland, 
native hedgerows and a number of water-bodies such as ditches. 
2.1.16 Nearby roads include the A421 which is approximately 2 km to the west and 
the B530 which lies to the east of the Project Site, as shown on Figure 12.2 
The A421 connects directly to Junction 13 of the M1 Motorway which is 
approximately 5.6 km to the south east of the Project Site. Furthermore the 
Midland Mainline Railway and Marston Vale Line border the Power 
Generation Plant Site to the east and west respectively. 
2.1.17 The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 90 m to the west of the Project Site 
boundary. South Pillinge Farm is separated from the Project Site by a small 
deciduous woodland. To the north of Green Lane and The Rookery, lies 
Stewartby. Other neighbouring residential areas include: Houghton Conquest 
approximately 1.5 km to the east of the Project Site boundary; Marston 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
11 
Moretaine approximately 1.2 km to the west; and Millbrook approximately 400 
m to the south. These residential areas are shown on Figure 1.1. 
2.1.18 To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, as 
shown on Figure 1.2, which provides habitat conservation opportunities, 
indoor and outdoor community amenities and a wind turbine. There is also a 
Forest Centre within the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park located just to 
the south of Stewartby Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor and 
outdoor community amenities. Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle testing 
ground, is located to the west of the Electrical Connection. 
2.1.19 It is noted here that the red line boundary of the Project Site has changed 
from that which was submitted with the Project Scoping Report and following 
from the non-statutory consultation events. Specifically it has increased to the 
west and south, in order to allow for more flexibility over easements for 
infrastructure associated with the Gas and Connection AGI. It has also 
increased in the north to allow for traffic calming measures which would be 
necessary during the construction phase. However, the Project Site has also 
decreased substantially in size in the south east as more work has been done 
to develop the likely route of Gas Connection. The assessments which have 
been carried out to date have all included this extended area and the change 
does not impact on the methodologies for environmental studies as proposed 
in the Project Scoping Report.  
2.2 
Relevant Planning History 
2.2.1 
The area around the Marston Vale has a long history of clay extraction, which 
was used primarily for the brick industry. Former clay extraction pits dominate 
the Marston Vale. Some have been restored for amenity use (e.g. on the 
nearby Millennium Country Park), some have been used for landfill (e.g. 
Stewartby and Brogborough), whereas the Rookery South Pit has remained 
as an open, undeveloped pit.  
2.2.2 
Partial backfilling of Rookery South Pit has been recorded, including 
deposition of non-hazardous liquid organic wastes from a variety of industrial 
sources. The waste was reportedly mixed with the Callow deposits and 
pumped, as sludge, into the south eastern quarter of the Rookery North Pit 
and the north eastern quarter of Rookery South Pit. 
2.2.3 
Additional fill to the base of Rookery South Pit has also been historically 
undertaken by placement of variable thicknesses (generally from 1 m to 4 m) 
of Callow Clay Fill across the base of the pit. These naturally occurring 
deposits were unsuitable for the brick making process and were cast back 
into the pit along with brick fragments and other overburden deposits. 
2.2.4 
Covanta Rookery South Limited obtained DCO consent pursuant to the PA 
2008 for a Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) NSIP in autumn 2011 (the 
"Covanta RRF Project"). This has since been the subject of legal challenge.

2.3 
Power Generation Plant Description 
Generating Equipment 
2.3.1 
The Generating Equipment would be designed as a peaking plant fired by 
natural gas. It would have a rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 
MW. 
2.3.2 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment would operate for up to 1,500 
hours per year. Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a ‘stress 
event’ on the grid. This occurs when there is a surge in demand for electricity 
associated with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the 
country boil kettles following the end of a popular television programme) or 
where there is a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which are 
constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking plants also help to 
‘balance out’ the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy 
sources, such as wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to 
their intermittent operation and reliance on weather conditions. 
2.3.3 
Given these parameters, it has been determined that a SCGT plant is the 
preferred and most appropriate technology choice for the Generating 
Equipment. 
2.3.4 
This PEIR has been prepared with relevance to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – 
‘Using the Rochdale Envelope’. AN9 states that: 
2.3.5 
“The Planning Inspectorate understands that in the early stages of preparing 
a DCO application it may not be possible for a developer to have resolved all 
the details of a project”. And that “The ‘Rochdale Envelope’ is an 
acknowledged way of dealing with an application comprising EIA 
development where details of a project have not been resolved at the time 
when the application is submitted”. 
2.3.6 
The DCO Application will be flexible enough using the ‘Rochdale Envelope’ 
approach to allow the Applicant to achieve an up to 299 MW project by 
building between one to five Gas Turbine Generators, with up to five exhaust 
gas flue stacks. 
2.3.7 
Despite this, it is also noted in AN9 that an EIA must “…..ensure that all the 
realistic and likely worst case variations of the project have been properly 
considered and clearly set out in the ES and as such that the likely significant 
impacts have been adequately assessed”. 
2.3.8 
To this end, where flexibility in parameters for the Project (such as the 
number of gas turbines) has been provided, the Applicant has assessed the 
realistic worst case and has been clear in each topic section what this 
constitutes. 
2.3.9 
There are several options of SCGT plant available to generate up to 299 MW. 
SCGT plants often use aero-derivative gas turbines (i.e. turbines derived from 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
13 
aeronautical applications), primarily because of their suitability for frequent 
start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability maintenance 
techniques. For the aero-derivative case, the Applicant envisages using three, 
four or five individual aero-derivative gas turbine generators to achieve up to 
299 MW. 
2.3.10 However, ‘industrial’ type gas turbines can also be used which are typically 
larger and often more suited to longer operational hours. They offer similar 
efficiency but less fast loading flexibility. Industrial gas turbines differ from 
aeronautical designs in that the casings, rotors and blading are of heavier 
construction. For the industrial gas turbine case, it is anticipated that one or 
two individual industrial gas turbine generators would be used to achieve up 
to 299 MW. 
2.3.11 The main equipment in a SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising the 
following components: 
� 
Inlet air filter; 
� 
Air compressor; 
� 
Combustion chamber; 
� 
Stack; 
� 
Power turbine(s); and 
� 
Exhaust silencer. 
2.3.12 Air, on entering the gas turbines, would be compressed and natural gas 
injected into the air. The natural gas would then burn in the combustion 
chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would then expand 
across the blades of the gas turbine driving the electrical generators to 
produce electricity. 
2.3.13 The waste gases and heat produced from this process would then be 
released to the atmosphere via between one or two stacks if industrial gas 
turbines were used and three to five stacks if aero derivative turbines were 
used. The stack(s) will contain equipment which will reduce emissions 
released to the atmosphere, including filters and a silencer. 
2.3.14 A stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project to 
determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generators, required 
for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air quality 
targets. The height is set out in Table 2.1 and would apply to all technology 
choices, as discussed above, and would not be dependent on the number of 
units present at the Generating Equipment Site. 
2.3.15 Stack emissions will be continuously recorded to ensure correct and efficient 
operation of the plant. Any significant deviations will be alarmed and 
corrections carried out on occurrence. Records of performance and deviation 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
14 
will be maintained. Full facilities for interfacing information, control and alarm 
systems will be installed so that the plant can be operated from the central 
control room via the distributed control system (DCS). In the event of a fault in 
the Gas Turbine Generator(s) or other major plant items, the Generating 
Equipment will shut down automatically in a controlled manner. 
2.3.16 Natural gas sourced from the NTS (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; consequently 
flue gas cleaning equipment is not required. 
2.3.17 Further discussion of emissions control is provided in Section 6 below which 
sets out the preliminary findings of the environmental assessments 
undertaken to date for air quality. 
2.3.18 Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of SCGT plants are significantly lower than, for example, 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plants. The auxiliary cooling 
requirements (for lubrication oil, etc.) would be met via dry air cooling through 
the use of fin-fan coolers or Air Cooled Condensers (ACC). 
2.3.19 Insert 2.1 shows a simple schematic of SCGT operation.

Laydown Area 
2.3.20 A temporary Laydown Area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site.  
Access Road 
2.3.21 An access track is already in existence at the Project Site which links Green 
Lane to Rookery South Pit. However, this track is only currently suitable for 
light use by off road vehicles. The LLRS works, as described in Paragraphs 
2.1.4 to 2.1.9 and Paragraph 2.6.2 of this PEIR include works to upgrade this 
track to agricultural standard. 
2.3.22 The DCO for the Covanta RRF Project includes provision to upgrade this 
track further, to a road which would be suitable to deliver the requirements of 
the Covanta RRF Project, including provision for several thousand traffic 
movements a week for the delivery of waste via large trucks. Should this road 
be developed prior to the Project, it would be suitable to meet both the needs 
of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project. In this instance, there would be 
no requirement for the Access Road to be built as part of the Project.  
2.3.23 However, as it is not certain as to when or if the Covanta RRF Project will be 
implemented, the Applicant has included the Access Road within its 
proposals for the Project. If the Covanta RRF Project is not built before 
construction of the Project, a new purpose built Access Road would be 
constructed within the Power Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the 
Generating Equipment Site. The 1.7 km long Access Road would be 
constructed from tarmac bordered by a concrete kerb. It is anticipated to be 6 
m wide allowing for two-way traffic. 
2.3.24 The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery 
South Pit, the Access Road would use the access ramp (built to agricultural 
standard as part of the LLRS as described below) to enter into the pit and 
cross through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment 
Site along the alignment shown on Figure 1.2. 
2.3.25 If Covanta implemented their proposals for an access road pursuant to the 
Covanta RRF Project prior to construction of the Project, then the Applicant's 
proposal for the Access Road pursuant to the Project would fall away. 
Other Generating Equipment Plant Items 
2.3.26 In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator units at the Generating Equipment 
Site, the following integral plant and buildings will also be present: 
� 
Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank will be designed to comply 
with the relevant fire regulations and will be installed together with fire 
pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable extinguishers; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
16 
� 
A Control Building: Required in order to monitor the plant operation and 
house plant controls; 
� 
A Workshop and Stores Building: To store certain strategic and routine 
maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out minor 
maintenance of the plant;  
� 
A Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc; 
� 
An Electrical Banking Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Power Generation Plant to transformers before 
export to the National Grid; and 
� 
A Gas Receiving Installation: Required to ensure that gas coming from the 
NTS feeds into the Generating Equipment Site at the right flow and 
pressure conditions. 
2.3.27 Figure 2.1 shows an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment. However, final design will not be undertaken until a 
DCO has been obtained and the Gas Turbine Generator(s) have been 
procured. The requirements to any DCO (similar to planning conditions) will 
control the detail of the final design and will require approval by the relevant 
planning authority at that time. The Applicant is therefore submitting its 
Application on the basis of a series of parameters. The environmental 
statement submitted with the Application will assess the realistic worst case 
arising out of these parameters in accordance with the "Rochdale Envelope" 
approach as explained in further detail in Paragraphs 2.3.4 to 2.3.8 above. 
2.3.28 The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be in the order 
of 4 ha. The Generating Equipment may be sited in a number of locations 
within the wider Generating Equipment Site depending on final design.  
2.3.29 Table 2.1 provides indicative dimensions for the main plant items located 
within the Generating Equipment Site.

Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CCS) 
2.3.30 On the basis that the Project's maximum rated electrical output would be 299 
MW, the Project would be below the threshold set out in Directive 
2009/31/EC29 and NPS EN-1 and EN-2 for when operators of combustion 
plants are required to have assessed the feasibility of: a storage site, 
transport facilities and economic considerations of the capture of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) produced as a result of the combustion process. Therefore it is 
not considered necessary to assess the viability of CO2 capture or include it 
further in this PEIR. 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
2.3.31 Efficient CHP plants are usually designed to meet the demands of an 
identified heat load. Electrical power generation is utilised, where applicable 
for local process plant, and the balance exported to the grid. The heat 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
18 
demands of industrial processes are usually continuous, and district heating 
demands are also usually continuous (albeit on a seasonal basis). 
2.3.32 Therefore, this is in direct contrast to the operation of a peaking plant, which 
is designed to operate intermittently and unpredictably. Therefore, any heat 
loads would be better served, and met more appropriately and efficiently by 
dedicated CHP plants, allowing the peaking plant to provide the necessary 
support to the NETS. 
2.3.33 With this in mind, CHP has not been a significant factor in the technology 
choice of the plant. 
2.3.34 In addition, as SCGT plant do not have any associated HRSG / steam turbine 
plant, the provision of steam from an SCGT plant would not be possible 
without the provision of additional steam raising plant / equipment. 
2.4 
Gas Connection 
2.4.1 
The Gas Connection would be in the form of a new underground gas pipeline 
connection (the Pipeline) and above ground installation (AGI) and is required 
to connect the Generating Equipment to the existing high pressure NTS in 
order to provide a reliable supply of fuel. 
2.4.2 
A Gas Connection Feasibility Study was undertaken for the Project in April 
2014. The purpose of the study was to define and evaluate the options 
available for connecting the Generating Equipment to a suitable source of fuel 
gas, and provide a recommendation on the most appropriate option for this 
connection. 
2.4.3 
The EIA Scoping Report for the Project described the Gas Connection 
Opportunity Area. This was a large area in which the Gas Connection could 
be sited. Since the Scoping Report was issued, a number of further studies 
have been undertaken to refine the route of the Gas Connection. The 
outcome of these studies is that there are now two remaining potential 
options to connect into the NTS and two potential suitable routes which the 
Pipeline could take in order to reach the two connection options. 
2.4.4 
The refinement studies are outlined in more detail in Section 5 of this PEIR. 
2.4.5 
The two possible remaining connection options are shown on Figure 1.2 and 
are described below.  
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1  
2.4.6 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 ("Option 1") is the current preferred 
option to connect the Generating Equipment to the NTS (as further explained 
in Section 5.4 of this PEIR).  The route in Option 1 is approximately 1.2 km in 
length including no major road crossings, one minor road crossing, no major 
water crossings, two minor water crossings and no in-road mainlaying. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
19 
2.4.7 
The pipeline begins at NTS Feeder 9, east of the Millbrook Proving Ground, 
between the railway and a set of 400 kV Overhead Lines which run from the 
south between the railway line and the Millbrook Proving Ground and to the 
north west between the Generating Equipment Site and Millbrook Proving 
Ground.  
2.4.8 
The route turns to cross Millbrook Road at 90°, in between the railway and 
the 400 kV overhead lines, this coincides with the crossing of a field drain. 
After crossing the road the route heads in a northerly direction through the 
fields between the railway and the overhead lines where it crosses a field 
boundary and continues in this direction until it turns to the north west to 
avoid a strip of trees classified as a Deciduous Woodland BAP Priority 
Habitat. 
2.4.9 
The route then turns to the north west crossing a field drain which coincides 
with a field boundary and a Public Right of Way (PRoW). The route continues 
in this direction briefly before taking a westerly turn for a short distance prior 
to undertaking a final northerly turn where it enters the Generating Equipment 
Site at its southern boundary.  
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
2.4.10 As an alternative to the current preferred Option 1, other options that the 
Applicant considers are less technically and environmentally preferable are 
still potentially deliverable as shown in the Gas Connection Route Corridor 
Option 2 ("Option 2") on Figure 1.2.  Although Option 2 has not been defined 
in as much detail as Option 1, the Applicant has included Option 2 within the 
redline boundary for the Project as the Applicant has not as yet made any 
final decisions on the final routing of the Gas Connection.  The final routing of 
the Gas Connection will be finalised by the Applicant following consultation 
and further assessment work. 
Connection to the NTS 
2.4.11 Connection of the Pipeline to an NTS feeder would require an Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) to be installed which will include: a Minimum Offtake 
Connection (MOC) facility, which would be owned by National Grid Gas Plc 
(NGG), and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) which would be owned by the Applicant 
(together, referred to as the ‘Above Ground Installation’ or ‘AGI’). 
2.4.12 The MOC (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain: 
� 
Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
� 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
� 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
2.4.13 The PTF (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain: 
� 
PIG launching facility; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
20 
� 
Emergency control valve; 
� 
Isolation valve; 
� 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
� 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
2.4.14 Termination of the Gas Connection would be at a PTF on the Generating 
Equipment Site. This facility would be situated within the Gas Receiving 
Station and would contain the following equipment: 
� 
PIG receiving facility; 
� 
Isolation valves, metering, heating, filtering, compression and pressure 
regulation equipment; 
� 
Electricity supply kiosk; and 
� 
Control and instrumentation kiosks. 
2.4.15 Until the preferred Option 1 is finalised following further consultation and 
studies, three options are being considered with regard to access for the Gas 
Connection. These four access options are shown on Figure 12.2, and are as 
follows:  
� 
from M1 Junction 13 via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, 
Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road;  
� 
from Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
and Millbrook Road,  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site;  
� 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road; or  
2.4.16 Depending on the final location of the AGI it is possible that a permanent new 
junction will be created off Houghton Lane in the case of Option1 or off either 
Millbrook Road or the B530 in the case of Option 2. 
2.5 
Electrical Connection 
2.5.1 
The Electrical Connection will comprise all the necessary elements to enable 
power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS, such as a 
new substation and up to two new electrical circuits. 
2.5.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken in March 2014 in order to 
define and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
21 
Equipment to the NETS. The most suitable point of connection would be a 
new substation to be located adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site, 
which would connect in to the line of the existing National Grid double circuit 
400 kV line (forming part of the NETS) which runs from Sundon to Grendon.  
The 400 kV line is located approximately 320 m southwest of the Generating 
Equipment Site and can clearly be seen on Figure 1.2. 
2.5.3 
For the purposes of this PEIR a realistic worst case scenario of up to two 
overhead line double circuits [of 400 kV] (including up to seven new 
transmission towers one of which will be replacing an existing tower and is 
likely to be located in close proximity to the location of that existing tower, 
thereby resulting in 6 net additional towers) has been assumed (and is being 
environmentally assessed) for the connection between the new substation 
(likely to be located adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site)  and the 
NETS. However The Applicant will continue to work with National Grid on the 
indicative design of the connection over the coming months.    
2.5.4 
Several access route options are still being considered with regard to 
accessing the Electrical Connection. They are shown on Figure 12.2, and are 
as follows:  
� 
From Junction 13 of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close, and Station 
Lane; 
� 
From Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road, 
Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and Station Lane;  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant Site; or 
� 
From the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7 km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and 
Station Lane.  
2.5.5 
In conjunction with the construction of the Electrical Connection a temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line located adjacent to the three most 
westerly existing transmission towers within the Project Site may be required.  
It is anticipated that the temporary diversion is likely to be constructed as a 
single circuit outage of the existing 400 kV line. The circuit is likely to 
comprise between one and four Lindsey towers, each being approximately up 
to 39 m high. The temporary works may also include the temporary erection 
of scaffolding over Station Lane.  
2.5.6 
Access for the purposes of installing and dismantling the temporary diversion 
would be as described for the Electrical Connection above. At this stage, it is 
anticipated that the installing and dismantling of the temporary works may 
require a closure of Station Lane for a number of hours and that the 
temporary diversion of the existing 400 kV line would be in place for 
approximately three months.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
22 
2.5.7 
Potential impacts could arise from the temporary diversion, through the 
possible closure of Station Lane and the possible removal of some vegetation 
where the Lyndsey towers are erected. The Lindsey towers, if required, would 
not require permanent foundations. At this stage, it is anticipated that these 
potential impacts would not give rise to any likely significant effects, however, 
further assessment will be carried out in the ES once the final design of the 
temporary works has been finalised. 
Construction, Operational and Decommissioning Timescales 
2.5.8 
Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months. The main works associated with the construction phase would be 
preparation for new foundations, potential piling (if required) and the laying of 
the Gas and Electrical Connections. No requirements for demolition or 
remediation have been identified at this stage. 
2.5.9 
As referred to in Paragraphs 2.1.4 to 2.1.9 of this PEIR, the option agreement 
between the applicant and the landowner ensures that,  as a minimum, the 
following components of the LLRS will be complete prior to construction of the 
Project commencing: 
� 
Topsoil stripping and stockpiling of material from the remaining southern 
permitted extraction area on the southern side of Rookery South Pit to 
enable the extraction of clay for use in the proposed restoration works; 
� 
Formation of a temporary noise screening bund from stripped topsoil and 
subsoil along the western edge of the works adjacent to South Pillinge 
Farm; 
� 
Redirection of existing surface water ditches and provision of an upper 
carrier ditch around the southern perimeter of the southern permitted 
excavation area; 
� 
Excavation of clay from the southern permitted extraction area to provide 
material for the proposed restoration works and buttressing works, 
including provision of a new access ramp from the extraction area into the 
base of the pit; 
� 
Construction of a new access ramp in the north west corner of Rookery 
South Pit; 
� 
Construction of a landscaped platform graded so drainage falls across the 
areas of the base of Rookery South Pit required for the Project, utilising 
material won from either regrading of the base of the pit or from the 
southern permitted extraction area, to enable gravity drainage to occur in 
the base of the pit; 
� 
Construction of surface water interceptor channels collecting to a single 
attenuation pond located at the north western corner of Rookery South Pit. 
The surface water interceptor channels and attenuation pond will include 
habitat mitigation and ecological enhancement measures; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
23 
� 
Provision of a pumping station to enable external discharge of collected 
waters from the attenuation pond to an existing ditch/culvert discharge to 
Stewartby Lake; 
� 
Buttressing of the pit edge slopes to the south (part) and north (part) to 
provide a slope stabilisation solution for the existing slopes; and 
� 
Redirection of existing surface water ditches and provision of an upper 
carrier ditch around the southern perimeter of the southern excavation 
area. 
2.5.10 The Generating Equipment, Gas Connection, Electrical Connection and 
Access Road would be designed to have an operational life of 25 years. 
However, it may be that in practice all or part of the Project operates for a 
longer period of time than this. For the purposes of assessment, 25 years has 
been assumed. Following the end of the operational life of the Generating 
Equipment, it would be decommissioned.  
2.5.11 Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Generating Equipment 
plant items and restoration of the Generating Equipment Site to a similar 
condition compared to before the commencement of construction. This 
process would also take approximately 22 months. It is likely that some 
structures associated with the Project may be left in situ to avoid any adverse 
environmental impacts associated with their removal. Due regard would be 
paid to all best practice guidelines and legislation on decommissioning of 
projects, which are relevant at the time of the decommissioning activities. 
Where possible, items of plant would be recycled or reused.

Regulatory and Policy Background 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
This section summarises the main regulatory and policy framework that is 
relevant to the Project at the international, national and local level. 
3.1.2 
A detailed description of the planning policy background and its relevance to 
the Project will be provided in the Planning Statement, which will be produced 
as a separate document to support the DCO Application. A summary of the 
Project in the context of the relevant NPS and such national and local policy 
as may be relevant and important to the SoS's decision on the Project  will be 
discussed more fully within the environmental statement that is submitted as 
part of the suite of documents that accompany the DCO Application for the 
Project. 
3.2 
European Union 
3.2.1 
The EU Directives of particular relevance to the Project (in respect of 
environmental requirements) are listed below. 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public 
and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive) 
3.2.2 
The EIA Directive ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely to have 
significant effects on the environment are made subject to an environmental 
assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation. The Directive sets the 
thresholds for projects that require an EIA (as stated in Section 1.3) and also 
outlines the impacts on the environment to be assessed in the EIA process. 
This Directive is implemented in the respect of NSIPs in the UK by the EIA 
Regulations. 
3.2.3 
It is noted here that the Directive has been amended as of May 2014 and the 
amendments are required to have been implemented in member states by 
May 2017. As such, the implementing legislation isn't likely to be in force 
during the examination of the DCO Application for the Project and the 
amendments to the Directive are therefore not considered in further detail. 
Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions 
(integrated pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial Emissions 
Directive (IED)); 
3.2.4 
In December 2010 the EU adopted a Proposal for a Directive on industrial 
emissions (IED). The IED recasts seven existing directives related to 
industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 January 2008 
concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the IPPC Directive) 
and Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of 
certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the Large 
Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into a single legislative instrument to 
improve the permitting, compliance and enforcement regimes adopted by 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
25 
Member States. However, the general principles of the IPPC Directive and 
the LCPD Directive are retained and will remain relevant to the proposed 
Project. The IED has been implemented in England and Wales by the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of natural 
habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive); 
3.2.5 
The aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-
diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and 
flora. Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member States are 
designed to maintain or restore, at favourable conservation status, natural 
habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of community interest whilst also 
taking into account economic, social and cultural requirements, and regional 
and local characteristics. The Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2010 implement the Habitats Directive in England and Wales. 
3.3 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects and Planning Act 2008 
3.3.1 
The Project is categorised as an NSIP and, if the DCO Application is 
accepted by PINs, it will be examined by PINS over a six month period. PINS 
will then, within three months, provide the SoS with a report setting out their 
conclusions and recommendations.  The SoS will then have three months to 
make his or her decision on the DCO Application. All of these steps are 
pursuant to the regime established by the PA 2008, as described in Section 1. 
3.3.2 
As set out in NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy), 
‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-specific energy NPS, 
provides the primary basis for decisions’ (Paragraph 1.1.1). The decision-
maker ‘should start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to 
applications for energy NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2) and on the basis that the 
urgent national need for such projects is settled. This approach is also 
supported by section 104 of the PA 2008 which requires the SoS to make a 
decision on an application in accordance with relevant NPSs, unless 
particular considerations apply (including where the adverse impacts of a 
development would outweigh its benefits). 
3.3.3 
The decision on an application must also be taken by the SoS having regard 
to a number of factors, including the local impact reports that will be provided 
by relevant local authorities, as well as any other matters which the SoS 
‘thinks are both important and relevant to its decision’ (section 104 of the PA 
2008). Important and relevant matters may include the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF), Development Plan Documents (DPD) or other 
documents in the Local Development Framework (LDF). 
3.4 
National Policy Statements 
3.4.1 
The PA 2008 introduced the concept of NPS. NPSs are not required under 
the PA 2008 but where a relevant NPS has been produced, the SoS must 
decide an application for a project in accordance with that NPS, unless 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
26 
certain considerations apply. The NPSs that are potentially relevant to the 
consideration of the DCO Application for the Project are: 
� 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1); 
� 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2); 
� 
The National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (NPS EN-4); and 
� 
The National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS 
EN-5). 
NPS EN-1 
3.4.2 
NPS EN-1 recognises that there is a significant need for new energy 
infrastructure. It states that pending plant closures in the UK will reduce 
available capacity by at least 22 GW by 2020 as a result of both tightening 
environmental legislation and older power stations approaching the end of 
their useful life (paragraphs 3.3.7 to 3.3.9). 
3.4.3 
Paragraph 4.1.9 of EN-1 notes that where the SoS is satisfied that financial 
viability and technical feasibility of the proposal has been properly assessed 
by an applicant, such considerations are unlikely to be of relevance in IPC 
decision making. Accordingly, information to provide comfort that the 
Applicant has considered financial viability and technical feasibility will be 
included within the ES and other documents submitted with the DCO 
Application. 
3.4.4 
NPS EN-1 also sets out guidance on the consideration of alternatives when 
developing a new energy generation project (paragraphs 4.4.1 to 4.4.3) and 
guidance relating to criteria for ‘good design’ of new developments (Section 
4.5). 
3.4.5 
Other assessment principles that are particularly likely to be relevant to 
energy NSIPs are set out as follows in NPS EN-1 (relevant paragraph 
numbers given in brackets): 
� 
Pollution control (4.10): describes the relationship with other regimes (e.g. 
Environmental Permitting) which is essentially that the decision maker 
should be satisfied that “potential releases can be adequately regulated 
under the pollution control framework” without unacceptable cumulative 
impacts arising and that he or she "should not refuse consent on the basis 
of pollution impacts unless [they have] good reason to believe that any 
relevant necessary operational pollution control permits or licences or 
other consents will not subsequently be granted". 
� 
Safety (4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): describes the 
relationship with other regimes and the general requirement that the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
27 
decision maker will need to be satisfied that these regimes are complied 
with. 
� 
Health (4.13): requires that where a proposed project has an effect on 
human beings, an assessment of potential health impacts is made in 
relation to each element of the project.  
� 
Nuisance and amenity (4.14): the relationship with common law nuisance, 
statutory nuisance, and the importance to be attached by the SoS to their 
consideration during the determination process, are set out. 
� 
Security (4.15): Government policy is set out as being “to ensure that, 
where possible, proportionate protective security measures are designed 
into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project 
development”. 
3.4.6 
As well as generic assessment principles, EN-1 also identifies a generic list of 
impacts which could arise from an energy NSIP and the criteria by which they 
should be assessed. These specific topics include air quality, biodiversity and 
geological conservation, nuisance (e.g. dust), flood risk, historic environment, 
landscape and visual, noise, socio-economics, traffic and transport, waste 
management and water quality. These topics are discussed in more detail 
when describing the preliminary assessment of impacts presented in this 
PEIR. 
NPS EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5 
3.4.7 
NPS EN-2 outlines considerations and factors relating to site selection and 
design for developers for fossil fuel generating stations, although it states that 
it is for the applicant to consider such matters, and that: “...the Government 
does not seek to direct applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating 
stations” (paragraph 2.2.1). NPS EN-2 sets out a number of specific impacts 
that could arise from a fossil fuel generating NSIP and criteria by which they 
should be assessed. These specific topics include air quality, landscape and 
visual, noise and vibration, and water quality and resources. These topics are 
discussed in more detail when describing the preliminary assessment of 
impacts in this PEIR. 
3.4.8 
NPS EN-4 sets Government policy on the relevant considerations and factors 
that should be taken into account as to route selection for developers for, 
inter alia, gas pipeline NSIPs. The NPS sets out a number of impacts that 
could arise from such development and criteria by which they should be 
assessed. These specific topics include biodiversity, noise and vibration, soil 
and geology, and water quality and resources. These topics have been 
discussed in more detail when describing the preliminary assessment of 
impacts in this PEIR. 
3.4.9 
NPS EN-5 provides the primary basis for decisions taken by SoS on 
applications it receives for electricity network NSIPs, including the relevant 
considerations and factors that should be taken into account related to route 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
28 
selection. The NPS sets out a number of impacts that could arise from such 
development and criteria by which they should be assessed. These specific 
topics include biodiversity and geological conservation, landscape and visual, 
noise and vibration, and electric and magnetic fields. These topics have been 
discussed in more detail when describing the preliminary assessment of 
impacts in this PEIR. 
3.5 
National Planning Policy Framework  
3.5.1 
The NPPF sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how 
these are expected to be applied. In the context of an NSIP, the NPPF notes 
at paragraph 3 that, whilst it does not contain any specific policies for NSIPs, 
the NPPF may be considered as being important and relevant in the context 
of decision making for an NSIP. 
3.5.2 
The NPPF sets sustainable development at the core of its guidelines and 
establishes a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ for decision-
taking at paragraph 14. Policies set out in paragraphs 18-219, taken as a 
whole, constitute the Government’s view of what sustainable development in 
England means in practice for the planning system. The NPPF focuses its 
interpretation of sustainable development into three dimensions: economic, 
social and environmental. 
3.5.3 
A set of 12 ‘core planning principles’ are also set out in the NPPF. Paragraph 
17 states that planning should ‘support the transition to a low carbon future in 
a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change, and 
encourage the reuse of existing resources, including conversion of existing 
buildings, and encourage the use of renewable resources (for example, by 
the development of renewable energy).’ 
3.5.4 
As part of delivering sustainable development, the NPPF presents 13 different 
thematic titles setting out distinct ways in which Government expects the 
operation of planning processes at the local level to achieve the 12 core land 
use planning principles. The most relevant of these 13 titles to this 
development have been listed below: 
� 
Building a strong, competitive economy (1); 
� 
Supporting a prosperous rural economy (3); 
� 
Promoting sustainable transport (4); 
� 
Requiring good design (7); 
� 
Promoting healthy communities (8); 
� 
Meeting the challenge of climate change, flooding and coastal change 
(10); 
� 
Conserving and enhancing the natural environment (11); and

Local Planning Policy 
Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies (Adopted November 2009) 
3.6.1 
The Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies was adopted in November 2009. The document is the key DPD for 
the northern part of the district and provides the long term vision and the 
direction for future development in this area over the period 2001 – 2026. 
3.6.2 
The Project Site is located within the Northern Marston Vale Strategic Area, 
which is allocated for significant housing, employment and environmental 
regeneration. Policy CS1 Development Strategy is considered relevant to this 
PEIR. 
Central Bedfordshire Development Strategy 
3.6.3 
The Development Strategy for Central Bedfordshire is currently being 
developed and will become, once adopted (potentially in Summer 2015), the 
planning policy document for the whole of Central Bedfordshire. It will set out 
the overarching spatial strategy and development principles for the area 
together with more detailed policies to help determine planning applications. 
The strategy will address similar issues to those in the Core Strategy and 
Development Management Policies, but will also consider the allocation of 
strategic development sites. 
Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council – 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (Adopted 
January 2014) 
3.6.1 The Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (MWLP:SSP) 
was adopted by Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough 
Councils on 30th January 2014.  The MWLP:SSP forms part of the emerging 
Minerals and Waste Local Development Framework for the three Councils, 
which will also include a General and Environmental Policies Local 
Development Document (adoption expected in 2015/16), Statement of 
Community Involvement (adopted in 2006), Supplementary Planning 
Document on Managing Waste in New Developments (adopted in 2006), and 
Policies Map. 
3.6.2 The MWLP:SSP sets out a series of strategic objectives for waste and 
minerals, together with strategic allocations for mineral extraction and waste 
management development and strategic policies to guide the ongoing supply 
of minerals and development of waste management facilities.  The 
MWLP:SSP addresses the provision of additional waste management capacity 
in a number of ways, including through various forms of recovery operations, 
in order to support the move towards a materials reusing economy.

Bedford Borough Local Plan 2032 
3.6.5 
Bedford Borough Council is currently in the early stages of preparing a new 
Local Plan that will guide new development within the Borough up to 
2032.  The new Local Plan will allocate the amount and location of new 
development across the Borough and contain planning policies to manage the 
delivery of new development.  An initial ‘Call for Sites’ and Issues and 
Options consultation was undertaken in early 2014, prior to anticipated 
submission in late 2015 and adoption in late 2016.  Upon adoption, the Local 
Plan 2032 will replace the adopted Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan as 
the key DPD for the Borough.

Environmental Impact Assessment Methodology 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
The 
information 
presented 
in 
this 
PEIR 
represents 
the 
available 
environmental information in respect of the Project as at the time of writing, 
based on up-to-date desk top studies, field surveys and assessments. Where 
additional information or studies are required in order to complete 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project 
(which will be reported on in the environmental statement submitted with the 
DCO Application), this has been highlighted in this PEIR.  
4.1.2 
In due course, the information summarised in this PEIR will be developed, 
both as a result of feedback provided through consultation influencing the 
development of the Project, as well as the continuing assessment work 
indicated below.  This further development will allow for preparation and 
finalisation of a comprehensive environmental statement that will accompany 
the DCO Application for the Project. 
4.2 
EIA Process 
4.2.1 
In accordance with the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA process for 
the Project has included the following: 
� 
Establishing, through consultation, the scope of the EIA by obtaining a 
Scoping Opinion from the SoS; 
� 
Consideration of potential technical and environmental alternatives to the 
Project; 
� 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing baseline 
environmental conditions for the Project Site and the relevant study areas 
for each topic; 
� 
Identifying the potential environmental impacts resulting from the Project; 
� 
Assessing the significance of the potential environmental effects of the 
Project against the baseline (which includes existing developments that 
are constructed and/or operational); 
� 
Assessing the significance of the potential effects of the Project arising in 
conjunction with proposed or consented but not yet constructed 
developments (cumulative effects) as well as certain effects acting in 
combination with other effects from the Project (in-combination effects);  
� 
Determining how potential significant adverse environmental impacts 
could be avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design (embedded 
mitigation) and / or further mitigation (additional mitigation) as well as  how 
any benefits of the Project may be enhanced (enhancement measures); 
and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
33 
� 
Proposing ways in which any significant adverse effects of the Project will 
be mitigated, managed and monitored through the DCO for the Project. 
4.2.2 
These steps are discussed in more detail in the following sections. 
4.3 
Scope of the Assessment 
4.3.1 
Under section 42 of the PA 2008, there is a duty placed on developers to 
consult certain prescribed bodies as well as local authorities and those with a 
certain interest in the Project Site. This section 42 consultation forms part of 
the statutory phase of consultation through which this PEIR has been 
published. 
4.3.2 
In addition to this statutory phase of consultation, the Applicant has 
undertaken non-statutory consultation with various communities, individuals 
and organisations. This will all be explained in detail in the consultation report 
that will be submitted as part of the suite of documents accompanying the 
DCO Application in 2015. However, for the purposes of this PEIR, it is worth 
noting that the Applicant has met CBC and BBC to discuss the Project in late 
May 2014. MPL will continue to liaise with these councils throughout all 
phases of the Project. 
4.3.3 
As stated in Section 1 of this PEIR, before commencing work on the EIA, the 
Applicant also sought a Scoping Opinion from PINS in June 2014. The 
request was supported by a Scoping Report that described the key 
anticipated environmental issues that would require detailed evaluation as 
part of the EIA process. The formal Scoping Opinion was received in July 
2014, and has allowed for agreement on the likely significant environmental 
effects of the Project and, therefore, the aspects of the environment on which 
the EIA should focus. 
4.4 
Environmental Baseline 
4.4.1 
In undertaking an EIA for any project it is important to identify the 
environmental baseline for the potential receptors which may be affected. 
Essentially, this involves forming an understanding of the environmental 
receptors in an area and the developments that are already affecting those 
receptors, as at the date of the assessment. This allows the effects of the 
Project to be compared and / or combined with the existing quality of the 
environment in order to ensure an informed assessment is made of the 
potential effects of a project and to allow the identification of the most 
appropriate mitigation which could be employed to minimise any significant 
adverse effects. 
4.4.2 
To establish the baseline, a study area that is appropriate for each 
assessment topic is identified which takes into consideration the surrounding 
context and the likely scale and range of potential effects (the study area for 
noise, for example, will cover a smaller area than that used to assess 
landscape and visual effects which may be experienced over a wider area). 
The study areas may be the same for certain assessment topics. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
34 
Confirmation of the study area for each assessment topic is clearly set out in 
the section for that topic below.  
4.4.3 
Next, a range of environmental data is gathered from a combination of 
sources in respect of each study area. This includes: 
� 
Documentary information on the Power Generation Plant Site, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection, and their surroundings within each 
relevant study area, including information available from previous EIA 
work for other projects; 
� 
Field survey information, including: Phase 2 ecological surveys; landscape 
character assessments; background noise levels; ground conditions / 
contaminated land assessments, location of sensitive receptors and traffic 
levels on the road network; and 
� 
Data held by both statutory and non-statutory consultees. 
4.5 
Assessment Methodology 
4.5.1 
To help evaluate and quantify the likely significant environmental effects of 
the Project, environmental significance criteria will be employed to ensure 
that the identified impacts and effects are understood. Effects may be positive 
(i.e. beneficial) or negative (i.e. adverse). 
4.5.2 
Environmental significance criteria are important as they will help inform the 
determination by the SoS of the overall acceptability of the Project.  
4.5.3 
The significance of environmental effects resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project will generally be presented in 
this PEIR using a series of matrices as shown below in Tables 4.1 - 4.3. 
These will be developed to describe the sensitivity of receptors which have 
the potential to be impacted by the Project and the magnitude of any impacts 
which are likely to arise. The magnitude of impact and sensitivity of receptor 
will be considered together, using professional judgement, to give an overall 
significance of effect for any potential impact. Where it is not possible to 
quantify effects, a precautionary qualitative assessment will be carried out, 
based on available knowledge and professional judgement. 
4.5.4 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of effects 
upon different environmental components, the assessments generally follow 
the structure and use the terminology outlined below in Tables 4.1 – 4.3. 
However, it is noted here that for some impact sections, significance criteria 
may need to differ depending on the conditions encountered at the Project 
Site. The criteria will therefore be subject to further discussion with statutory 
consultees. Each technical section of the ES will clearly identify and explain 
any specific criteria used. Unless otherwise stated, effects of moderate 
significance or above are considered to be significant for the purposes of the 
EIA Regulations.

Structure of the PEIR 
4.6.1 
This PEIR has been prepared in discrete sections to allow the reader to 
understand the Applicant's proposals for the Project, the purpose of the PEIR, 
the regulatory framework in which it has been prepared, and the 
methodologies and preliminary assessment of the likely significant effects of 
the Project. 
4.6.2 
The environmental topics which are covered in this PEIR are: 
� 
Air Quality – Section 6; 
� 
Noise and Vibration – Section 7; 
� 
Ecology – Section 8; 
� 
Water Quality and Resources – Section 9; 
� 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology– Section 10; 
� 
Landscape and Visual – Section 11; 
� 
Traffic, Transport and Access – Section 12; 
� 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage – Section 13;  
� 
Socio-Economics – Section 14; and 
� 
Other topics considered (Waste and Electromagnetic Frequency (EMF)) - 
Section 15. 
4.6.3 
Each topic section includes (many of the following items appear in matrix 
form): an explanation of the relevant legislation and policy for that topic; a 
brief explanation as to the assessment methodology used (including 
baseline); a preliminary assessment of the likely significant environmental 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
38 
effects of the Project for that topic; an explanation of what additional 
mitigation may be appropriate; an assessment of the residual likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project for that topic; an assessment of the 
cumulative effects of the Project for that topic; and a conclusion. 
4.7 
Cumulative Effects 
4.7.1 
Schedule 4, Part 1 (para 20) of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 requires an ES to include “…a 
description of the likely significant effects of the development on the 
environment, which should cover….cumulative effects”.   
4.7.2 
In terms of assessing the effects of the Project together with proposed or 
approved but not implemented projects, the Applicant notes that PINS Advice 
Note 9 (Version 2, April 2012) provides a definition of cumulative effects in 
which it describes cumulative impacts as considering “…other proposed 
development within the context of the site and any other reasonably 
foreseeable proposals in the vicinity” (AN9, footnote 12). 
4.7.3 
AN9 also sets out that "the potential cumulative impacts with other major 
developments will also need to be carefully identified such that the likely 
significant impacts can be shown to have been identified and assessed 
against the baseline position (which would include built and operational 
development). In assessing cumulative impacts, other major developments 
should be identified through consultation with the local planning authorities 
and other relevant authorities on the basis of those that are: 
� 
under construction; 
� 
permitted application(s), but not yet implemented;  
� 
submitted application(s) not yet determined;  
� 
projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s Programme of Projects; 
� 
identified in the relevant Development Plan (and emerging Development 
Plans - with appropriate weight being given as they move closer to 
adoption) recognising that much information on any relevant proposals will 
be limited; and 
� 
identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set the 
framework for future development consents/approvals, where such 
development is reasonably likely to come forward".  
4.7.4 
 As there is no standard approach to the assessment of cumulative effects 
and differing approaches have been adopted by different projects, for the 
purposes of this EIA, it is proposed that cumulative effects are treated as 
described below. 
4.7.5 
It is anticipated that construction of the Project will commence in 2017, if a 
DCO is granted by the SoS for the Project. In order to assess the cumulative 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
39 
effects of the Project together with other developments that are proposed or 
consented but not yet built, the Applicant proposes to use a '2017 baseline' to 
provide a future baseline against which the direct, indirect and cumulative 
effects of the Project can be assessed. This baseline will include the 
developments that the Applicant knows will be completed prior to the 
commencement of construction of the Project. A clear example of such a 
project would be the LLRS. As it is not certain that the Covanta RRF Project 
DCO will be implemented by 2017, the Applicant has included the Covanta 
RRF Project within its cumulative effects assessment rather than including 
this in the 2017 baseline. The Applicant has not assumed that that Covanta 
RRF Project is already either constructed or operational as at 2017. 
4.7.6 
The developments which have been assessed cumulatively include:  
� 
The Proposed Covanta RRF Project) to be developed to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
� 
Integrated Waste Management Operations at Rookery South, 
Bedfordshire; 
� 
Brogborough Wind Energy Project at Brogborough Landfill Site; 
� 
Land at Moreteyne Farm at Wood End in Marston Moretaine; 
� 
Land at Warrant Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill proposed for residential 
properties; 
� 
Land East and West of Broadmead Road, Stewartby proposed for 
residential properties - under construction; and 
� 
The new settlement at Wixams. 
4.7.7 
As part of the initial scoping of the EIA it was determined that certain topics 
are more likely to give rise to potential significant cumulative effects than 
others, based on the nature of the Project and surrounding development 
proposals. Therefore certain topic assessments have focused specifically, at 
this preliminary stage of the assessment, on potential cumulative effects and 
interactions.  These topics are air quality, noise, traffic and landscape and 
visual effects.  For example, air quality may give rise to a potential cumulative 
effect given that there are emissions from the Generating Equipment and also 
potential emissions from, for example, the proposed Covanta RRF Project. 
4.7.8 
For those remaining topics where cumulative effects and interactions are 
unlikely, due for example to the limited geographical nature or significance of 
the potential effect, potential cumulative effects have been considered at a 
commentary level only at this preliminary stage and will be considered in 
detail as the assessment is completed. An example of this is in relation to 
ground conditions where there will be no significant effects arising from the 
Project and therefore no potential cumulative effects are anticipated.

4.8 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
4.8.1 
Two broad types of potential mitigation measures will be described in the ES: 
� 
Embedded mitigation - namely design/standard control measures, such as 
working within best practice guidance, which will routinely be incorporated 
for the Project or for any similar project constructed in the UK, and as such 
will be used to produce the initial assessment as to the likely significant 
effects of the Project; and  
� 
Additional mitigation - which may be introduced, where appropriate, 
following the assessment of the likely significant effects of the Project 
(which will include embedded mitigation in its design). It is this additional 
mitigation that will then be assessed for effectiveness and so taken into 
account in the final assessment of the residual likely significant 
environmental 
effects 
of 
the 
Project 
(i.e. 
the 
likely 
significant 
environmental effects that remain following the application of additional 
mitigation).  
4.8.2 
Full consideration has been given to the potential mitigation measures which 
could be used to ensure that any potentially adverse significant environmental 
effects of the Project are minimised. 
4.8.3 
In the hierarchy of mitigation, likely significant adverse effects should, in the 
first instance, be avoided altogether; where this is not possible such effects 
should then be reduced and, finally, off-set. 
4.8.4 
Significant adverse effects are best avoided by incorporating appropriate 
measures into the design process. As such, the iterative nature of the EIA 
process can help to inform the development of the design of the Project that 
will be the subject of the DCO Application in 2015. 
4.8.5 
The Project has and will continue to be developed in such a way that the 
reduction and, wherever possible, elimination of significant adverse 
environmental effects are integral to the overall design philosophy. 
4.8.6 
Where it is not possible to avoid adverse significant environmental effects, 
potential mitigation and monitoring measures will be discussed in each 
assessment Section. These measures will then be secured in the draft DCO 
that is submitted as part of the Application in 2015. 
4.9 
Residual Effects 
4.9.1 
Residual effects of the Project will also be described. These are defined as 
effects which cannot be fully remedied through the application of mitigation 
and therefore remain in place after mitigation has been applied.  
4.10 Assumptions and Limitations 
4.10.1 The following assumptions have been made in compiling this PEIR:

Alternatives 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
The EIA Regulations require that an ES should include an outline of the main 
alternatives that have been studied by an applicant and an indication of the 
main reasons for the applicant's choice, taking into account the environmental 
effects. Under the EIA Regulations there is no requirement to assess 
alternatives, only a requirement to provide information on those alternatives 
that have been considered. 
5.1.2 
The design iterations and alternatives considered at this stage in the Project 
are described further below. 
5.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
5.2.1 
In deciding upon the location for the Power Generation Plant, WPL has had 
regard to a number of factors such as those described in NPS EN-2. 
However, in line with paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy 
companies to decide which applications to bring forward and the government 
does not seek to direct applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating 
stations." Unlike, for example, nuclear generating stations. 
5.2.2 
The key factors considered necessary in selecting a suitable site were 
broadly fourfold; technical, environmental, economic, and in line with local 
planning policy. 
5.2.3 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons: 
� 
Close proximity to the gas NTS; 
� 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead line); 
� 
The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, lying 
below ground level; 
� 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
� 
It has a well-developed road network for access to the Project Site; 
� 
The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; and  
� 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
integral infrastructure. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
43 
5.3 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.1 
The following technology options have been considered for the Power 
Generation Plant: SCGT plant: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; 
and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant. 
5.3.2 
SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant at the Project Site based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
� 
Visual impact: SCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to CCGT 
plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the 
surrounding environment; 
� 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is significantly 
lower than for CCGT plants; 
� 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant would typically 
be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE units would be 
required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate up to 299 MW. 
Spatially this may not be possible; 
� 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that 
the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly cost 
effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
� 
Start-up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to 
meeting variable demands. 
5.3.3 
As discussed in Paragraphs 2.3.31 to 2.3.33 of this PEIR, the potential for 
using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also considered. 
However it is not considered to be technically or economically feasible with a 
SCGT peaking power station because the profile for the generation of 
electrical energy from the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the 
required heat demand profile of any potential consumer. 
5.4 
Gas Connection 
5.4.1 
The Project Scoping Report described a Gas Connection ‘Opportunity Area, 
to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which a new gas pipeline 
and AGI would be developed. Since the publication of the Scoping Report, 
further studies have refined this Opportunity Area such that there are now two 
remaining Gas Connection Route Corridor Options (as described in Section 
4).  
5.4.2 
These options have been chosen as the most direct connections between the 
Generating Equipment Site and the NTS, avoiding obstructions such as 
roads, large changes in elevation, water bodies and protected sites as much 
as possible.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
44 
5.4.3 
Option 1 is the preferred Gas Connection Route Corridor Option. This is 
because it is shorter (and therefore less expensive and less damaging to 
agricultural land), it avoids crossing the midland mainline railway line, and 
other high pressure gas pipelines. 
5.4.4 
Nevertheless, Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2remains a viable 
alternative should further studies reveal any as yet unknown constraints on 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1such as previously undiscovered 
archaeological remains.  
5.4.5 
Consultation feedback will be considered in determining which option is the 
most appropriate, but for the purposes of the PEIR, both options have been 
assessed. 
5.5 
Electrical Connection 
5.5.1 
The Project's Scoping Report described an Electrical Connection Opportunity 
Area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which the Electrical 
Connection would be developed. Since publication of the Scoping Report, 
further studies have been undertaken to refine the available options.  
5.5.2 
Based on these studies, it has been determined that the most suitable 
location for the substation is within Rookery South Pit, adjacent to the 
Generating Equipment Site. However, a number of options still exist on the 
best way to connect the substation to the NETS.  
5.5.3 
The main reasons for siting the substation adjacent to the Generating 
Equipment Site are as follows: 
� 
Lower visual impact - The substation would be located entirely within 
Rookery South Pit, which is below ground level. The maximum height of 
the tallest structures within the substation would be 17.5 m, meaning they 
would be substantially screened by the pit, which is approximately 15 
meters below ground level (mbgl). If the substation were to be developed 
outside of the Generating Equipment Site, it would need to be sited to the 
south on higher lying agricultural land. In this location, the substation 
would be far more visually intrusive, particularly if viewed from the south 
and east.  
� 
It is recognised that siting the substation in the Generating Equipment Site 
means that there may be a need for pylons to support a new overhead 
electrical cable. However, this impact is considered less than those arising 
from siting the substation out of the Generating Equipment Site.   
� 
Less impact on agricultural land – As stated above, should the substation 
be located outside of the Generating Equipment Site, it would be 
developed on agricultural land. This would not only take more greenfield 
land than six net additional towers, but would also impact on drainage 
runoff rates as agricultural land would be replaced by hardstanding.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
45 
� 
Less impact on previously undisturbed ground – Previously undeveloped 
land outside of the Generating Equipment Site is known to have the 
potential to support buried archaeology. Therefore avoiding this area, and 
instead using land in the Generating Equipment Site which has previously 
been disturbed removes a potential impact on the archaeology and 
cultural heritage of the area.  
5.5.4 
Although the substation is located adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site, 
it is assessed in this PEIR under the “Electrical Connection” sections of each 
topic section (and is not being included as part of the assessment for the 
Power Generation Plant in each topic section).

Air Quality 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
This section of the PEIR presents the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of likely significant air quality effects arising from the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Project on sensitive human and ecological 
receptors in and around the vicinity of the Project Site. Potential effects could 
result from vehicle emissions and dust generation during construction and 
decommissioning, and stack emissions during operation of the Generating 
Equipment. 
6.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
6.2.1 
Relevant policy and guidance relating to air quality is set out in Appendix 2.6.  
Assessment Methodology 
Study Area 
6.2.2 
In relation to construction and decommissioning dust effects, the study area is 
defined in accordance with the Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM, 
2014) ‘Guidance on the assessment of dust from demolition and construction’ 
(the "IAQM Guidance") which provides screening criteria for the consideration 
of dust impacts.  The screening distances for human and ecological receptors 
are: 
� 
Human – within 350 m of the boundary of the site, or 50 m of the routes 
used by construction vehicles on the public highway, within 500 m of the 
site entrance; and 
� 
Ecological – 50 m of the boundary of the site or 50 m of the routes used by 
construction vehicles on the public highway, within 500 m of the site 
entrance. 
6.2.3 
These distances have therefore been used to set the study area in this 
preliminary assessment as to whether there are any likely significant effects 
of the Project in relation to air quality from dust. Both on-site and off-site dust 
effects have been considered.  
6.2.4 
The impact of the emissions from vehicles  during the construction, 
operational and decommissioning phases (both on- and off-site) of the Project 
has been  assessed using the methodology prescribed in the Department for 
Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 Section 
3, Part 1: Air Quality’ for the estimation of emissions from vehicles.  
Receptors are defined in relation to their distance from affected roads, where 
the distance is up to 200 m from the road.  Affected roads are defined as: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
47 
� 
Road alignment will change by 5 m or more; or 
� 
Daily traffic flows will change by 1,000 or more; or 
� 
Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) flows will change by 200 AADT or more; or 
� 
Daily average speed will change by 10 km/hr or more; or 
� 
Peak hour speed will change by 20 km/hr or more. 
6.2.5 
The study area for emissions to air during operation of the Generating 
Equipment is 10 km from the approximate centre of the Generating 
Equipment Site as per the Environment Agency ("EA") criteria in H1 Annex F.     
6.2.6 
Whilst the study area extends to 10 km, ambient pollutant concentrations as a 
result of emissions from the Generating Equipment are likely to be at a 
maximum concentration within 1 km of the Generating Equipment Site and 
therefore residential receptors are most likely to be affected within this 
distance. For ecological receptors, the study area is 10 km for internationally 
designated sites (SACs, SPAs, and RAMSARs), and 2 km for nationally 
designated sites (SSSIs, NNRs, LNRs, CWSs), as per the Environment 
Agency ("EA") criteria in H1 Annex F1.  
6.2.7 
Based on the risk of dust impacts, appropriate mitigation is selected from the 
IAQM Guidance by using professional judgement.  
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
6.2.8 
In respect of Air Quality, the realistic worst case scenario from within the 
proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of this 
PEIR) are Five Aero-derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 30 
m high stack 
6.2.9 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to air 
quality impacts is that the buoyancy of a plume is, principally, a function of its 
temperature and volume. Assuming the thermal efficiency of the units for all 
options of between one and five units is the same, a specific plant electrical 
output will require a specific amount of natural gas. The combustion of this 
gas would thus result in a specific volume of flue gas. 
6.2.10 The temperature of the flue gases will be similar irrespective of the number of 
installed units. However, if the flue gases are split between multiple stacks, 
the volumetric flow rate of each plume will be reduced (e.g. the use of five 
stacks will emit 20 per cent of the total flue gas volume) thus reducing the 
buoyancy of the flue gases proportionately. 
6.2.11 The reduction in buoyancy will limit the potential for atmospheric dispersion of 
the flue gases.   For instance, simple plume rise calculations indicate that the

48 
potential plume rise for emissions from five individual stacks would be around 
half that which could be achieved for emissions for the same total volume of 
flue gas but from two individual stacks. 
6.2.12 Both Gas Connection Route Corridor Options have been assessed and the 
worst case Electrical Connection of two double circuit overhead lines with 
seven new additional towers (one of which will be replacing an existing tower, 
thereby resulting in six net additional towers) has been assessed.  
Ambient Air Quality and the Protection of Human Health 
6.2.13 The AQS Regulations2 specify a series of standards and objectives for air 
quality in the UK. The objectives are summarised in Table 2.6.1 of Appendix 
2.6 and consider the pollutants that form the principal products of industrial 
combustion processes. In the case of combustion of natural gas in a power 
station, these are NOx and Carbon Monoxide (CO).  Assessment of these 
pollutants therefore forms the basis for assessment of emissions to air for the 
operational phase of the Generating Equipment. The deposition of nutrient 
nitrogen and the acidity due to nitrogen as a result   of operation of the 
Generating Equipment under all development scenarios will be undertaken in 
accordance with the Environment Agency (EA) guidance “AQTAG 06 -  
Technical Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate 
assessment for emissions to air” (2010). Critical loads (to be used as 
standards for the assessment of significance) will be obtained from the Air 
Pollution Information System (APIS). 
6.2.14 The critical loads are specific to the individual ecological receptors.  Table 6.7 
in Section 6.3 below sets out the critical loads for the ecological receptors 
being assessed. 
Building Downwash 
6.2.15 When an air pollution plume flows over nearby buildings or other structures, 
turbulence is caused on the downwind side of the building. This turbulence 
can cause a plume from a stack source to be forced down to the ground 
much sooner than it would if a building or structure were not present. This is 
known as building downwash.  
6.2.16 The downwash effects of buildings are considered to be potentially significant 
if they are within a distance from the stack(s) which is equivalent to five times 
the stack height and if the building height is greater than 30 per cent of the 
stack height. All buildings are assumed to be located in the indicative layout 
as shown in Figure 2.1. As such, none of the buildings present at the Project 
Site will give rise to significant downwash effects.  
Receptors and Additional Model Data 
6.2.17 The ADMS 5 model was used for the modelling of the dispersion of exhaust 
gases during operation of the Generating Equipment.  ADMS 5 is a second

generation air dispersion model developed in the UK and accepted by the EA 
for the purposes of EIA (and is also used by the EA in the assessment and 
determination of applications for environmental permits). 
6.2.18 The ADMS 5 model calculates time averaged ground level concentrations 
over any set of distances from the source. The preliminary study for the 
identification of the likely height of the stacks for the Project used a 4 km by 4 
km Cartesian grid with 44.4 m spacing to predict the maximum process 
contributions to ground level concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the 
Generating Equipment Site.  
6.2.19 The meteorological data used for this modelling exercise was that from the 
station at Cranfield; it is considered that this data will be representative of the 
conditions experienced at the Generating Equipment Site as it lies 
approximately 6km away. The data period considered was 2009-2013 
inclusive as per current EA guidelines for the need to use recent 
meteorological data over five consecutive years. For each year the 
predominant wind direction was from the south west. 
6.2.20 Terrain effects generally occur when ground levels change by more than 1 in 
10.  A terrain file was created from the LLRS contour levels to account for the 
change in levels in the vicinity of the Generating Equipment. 
Fuel-specific Dispersion Model Inputs 
6.2.21 The air dispersion modelling assumes that the Generating Equipment 
operates at full load for 1,500 hours per year, i.e. the maximum possible 
number of operational hours.  
6.2.22 All emissions from the combustion of the fuel gases will be discharged from 
the stack(s) that will be located within the Generating Equipment Site. The 
indicative emission parameters for the stacks are shown in Table 6.1.  The 
only pollutants of concern in relation to gas combustion are oxides of nitrogen 
(NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO).  Gas combustion does not generate 
significant quantities of particulate matter or sulphur dioxide (SO2) as the 
sulphur content in natural gas is negligible.  Emissions of NOx are the 
controlling pollutant for the determination of the stack height, the results of the 
CO modelling will be reported in the ES although, based on this preliminary 
assessment, it is considered very unlikely that assessment levels for CO will 
be breached.

Atmospheric Chemistry 
6.2.23 Emissions of NOx from combustion sources include both nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2) and nitrogen monoxide (NO), with the majority being in the form of NO.  
In ambient air, NO is oxidised to form NOx, and it is NO2 which has the more 
significant health impacts.  For this assessment, the conversion of NO to NO2 
has been estimated using the worst case assumptions set out in EA 
guidance3, namely that: 
� 
For the assessment of long term (annual mean) impacts, at receptors 70 
percent of NOx is NO2; and

51 
� 
For the assessment of short term (hourly mean) impacts, at receptors 35 
percent of NOx is NO2.   
6.2.24 The oxidation of NO to NO2 is not, however, an instantaneous process and 
where the maximum impacts occur within a few hundred metres of the stacks 
(as will be the case for the Generating Equipment), the EA assumptions offer 
a worst case assessment as the conversion rates may be very conservative. 
Stack Height 
6.2.25 As set out in Paragraph 2.3.14 of this PEIR, a stack height sensitivity study 
has been undertaken for the Project - dated August 2014.  This study 
examined differing stack heights in 2.5 m intervals from 15m to 40m 
(inclusive).  The stack height sensitivity study considered long term and short 
term contributions to ground level concentrations of NO2. 
6.2.26 The stack height modelling results have been compared against the UK AQS 
objectives (as set out in the AQS Regulations and summarised in Table 2.6.1 
of Appendix 2.6). The stack height study predicted the 99.79th percentile 
hourly average and the annual average NO2 ground level concentrations as a 
result of the operation of the Power Generation Plant. The percentile value is 
used for compliance with EU and UK legislation. 
6.2.27 Based on this analysis it has been determined that a stack height of between 
30 and 40 m is suitable for the Generating Equipment so as to achieve 
adequate dispersion of air emissions without impacting on sensitive receptors 
and ensuring compliance with the UK AQS objectives.  
Significance Criteria 
Construction / Decommissioning 
6.2.28 In accordance with the IAQM Guidance, the dust emission magnitude is 
defined as high, medium or low (Table 6.2) taking into account the 
construction / decommissioning activity taking place on a site, combined with 
applying professional judgement. 
6.2.29 The sensitivity of the study area to construction and decommissioning dust 
impacts has been defined based on the examples provided within the IAQM 
Guidance as set out in Table 6.2 below and taking into account and applying 
professional judgement.

6.2.31 Effects of medium or above are considered to be significant in terms of the 
EIA regulations.  
6.2.32 Given the distance of the nearest ecological receptor to the Project Site, dust 
impacts on ecological receptors have been scoped out of the assessment.  
Operation – Human Health Receptors 
6.2.33 The assessment of the effect of emissions to air from the Generating 
Equipment on human health receptors has been considered in line with 
criteria in the EA H1 Annex F guidance4. The contribution of the Generating 
Equipment (the process contribution (or PC)) has been added to an estimate 
of the background concentration to provide the predicted environmental 
concentration (PEC). The maximum process contribution can be considered 
to be “significant” if the ground level concentrations exceed 10 percent of the 
short term objectives and 1 percent of the long term objectives.   
6.2.34 In all cases, the PEC should be below the relevant assessment level for the 
relevant pollutant as set out in Table 2.6.1 in Appendix 2.6 of this PEIR. 
Where a PC causes a breach of the relevant assessment level, and the PC is 
the significant causing factor for the breach then the PC is unlikely to be 
acceptable and further controls are likely to be required on the operation of 
the installation to mitigate the impact (i.e. additional mitigation to reduce 
emissions or the consideration of the need for a higher stack). 
6.2.35 Operation of the access road is not considered to give rise to any noticeable 
impacts on air quality given the very limited number of vehicle movements (4 
staff on site at any one time).  
Operation – Ecological Receptors 
6.2.36 The long-term (annual average) limit for NOx of 30 µg/m3 is the critical level 
for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems as set by Defra. In addition,

the EA H1 Annex F Guidance has set a NOx daily mean concentration 
assessment level of 75 µg/m3 in accordance with WHO guidelines5. 
6.2.37 This preliminary assessment of the effect of emissions to air from the 
Generating Equipment on ecological receptors has also been carried out in 
line with criteria set out in the EA's H1 Annex F Guidance.  The maximum 
PEC within the habitat should not exceed the critical level for the habitat set 
out in the guidance; whereas the maximum predicted deposition (from the 
process and background), should not exceed the critical load.  In the case 
where the critical level or load are already exceeded as a result of the 
background concentrations or deposition rates, then the additional 
contribution from the process should be less than 1 percent of the 
assessment value, otherwise the additional contribution is potentially 
significant and a Habitats Risk Assessment (HRA) would be necessary (see 
Section 8 of this PEIR for further information on HRA).

The adverse effect caused by 
emissions on Cooper’s Hill is of 
concern to us. Sulphur dioxide 
and Nitrogen Dioxide, both 
contributing to acid rain and 
hampering the growth of plants 
will have an adverse impact. 
There is also a health risk from 
dioxins via the food chain and 
this too is of concern to us, 
being a farming area. We 
would need reassurance of 
how these emissions are to be 
monitored and procedures in 
the event of the monitoring 
system failing. 
There will be negligible 
emissions of sulphur dioxide 
from the Generating 
Equipment.  The effect of 
oxides of nitrogen emissions 
will be considered within the 
ES.

Embedded Mitigation 
6.3.1 
In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on air quality as 
a result of the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project, it 
has been assumed that certain elements of ‘embedded mitigation’ will be 
applied during construction, decommissioning and operation. These 
mitigation items can often be considered as standard, best practice working 
methods, without which the Project would not be allowed to be developed. In 
terms of protection of air quality, these standard mitigation measures include: 
� 
Adherence to a CEMP which will limit dust emissions during construction; 
� 
Standard mitigation for low risk sites from IAQM Guidance; and  
� 
Ensuring stack height achieves adequate dispersion to comply with 
relevant guidance.

Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
6.4.1 
Information on existing air quality has been obtained by collating the results of 
monitoring carried out by CBC and BBC. Background concentrations for the 
Project Site have been defined using the national pollution maps published by 
Defra. These cover the whole country on a 1x1 km grid (Defra, 2014).  
6.4.2 
Existing nitrogen and acid deposition rates within the study area were 
determined from the Air Pollution Information System ("APIS") website6. 
6.4.3 
The nearest Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) to the Project Site is 
within Bedford, approximately 10 km northeast of the Project Site. The 
AQMA, declared primarily on the basis of traffic related NO2, covers an area 
of the town centre including High Street and Prebend Street.  In light of the 
fact that this AQMA is located approximately 10 km northeast of the Project 
Site, based on the preliminary assessment, it is considered that emissions 
from the Power Generation Plant are unlikely to impact significantly on this 
AQMA. 
6.4.4 
CBC has two real time analysers sited in Sandy (approximately 18 km from 
the Project Site) monitoring NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 and in Marston Moretaine 
monitoring Ozone (O3)).  In addition a network of NO2 diffusion tube monitors 
are utilised throughout CBC's district.  The nearest diffusion tube is in 
Brogborough, approximately 4.5 km south west of the Project Site.  Recent

Construction/Decommissioning  
6.4.11 The 
main 
potential 
air 
quality 
effects 
during 
construction 
and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant are dust deposition and 
elevated PM10 concentrations. The following activities have the potential to 
cause emissions of dust:  
� 
Site preparation including delivery of construction material, erection of 
fences and barriers; 
� 
Earthworks including digging foundations and landscaping; 
� 
Materials handling such as storage of material in stockpiles; 
� 
Construction and fabrication of units;  
� 
Decommissioning activities including demolition of buildings; and 
� 
Disposal of waste materials off-site. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
64 
6.4.12 Typically the main cause of unmitigated dust generation on construction / 
decommissioning sites is from demolition and vehicles using unpaved haul 
roads, and off-site from the suspension of dust from mud deposited on local 
roads by traffic. The main determinants of unmitigated dust annoyance are 
the weather and the distance to the nearest receptor.  
6.4.13 In addition to the generation of dust and PM10 emissions, emissions of NOx 
can occur from road traffic and equipment used on site. 
6.4.14 The preliminary assessment of effects on air quality arising from the 
construction/decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant is presented in

Operation 
6.4.15 The most significant pollutant that would be emitted from the operation of the 
Generating Equipment would be NOx.  A proportion of the NOx emitted will be 
converted in the atmosphere to NO2 and the ground level concentrations of 
this pollutant have been used to set an appropriate stack height for the 
Generating Equipment (30 - 40 m) so as not to breach the AQM limits.  
6.4.16 Combustion in Gas Turbine Generators is conducted at high excess air rates, 
(typically 200-300 percent) which provide conditions as close to complete 
combustion as possible. There are, therefore, very low levels of CO or 
unburned hydrocarbons present in the products of combustion when burning 
natural gas. 
6.4.17 The preliminary assessment of effects on air quality arising from the operation 
of the Power Generation Plant is presented below in Table 6.10.

Operation 
6.5.4 
Emissions to air during the operational phase of the Gas Connection will 
potentially include infrequent emissions of natural gas.  These are expected 
to be minimal and limited to infrequent venting of gas from the AGI under 
abnormal, maintenance or emergency conditions. There will also be very 
minor emissions from vehicles accessing the AGI for maintenance reasons.  
6.5.5 
It is also noted here that the SoS, in the Scoping Opinion, commented that 
the potential effects of air quality from operation of the Gas Connection could

Project as a Whole 
6.7.1 
The Summary of Effects Table 6.15 below includes a section on the effects of 
the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.   
6.7.2 
The Project, as a whole, is not considered to have any likely significant 
effects on air quality during construction, operation or decommissioning, as 
none of the individual elements of the Project will have significant effects.  
6.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
6.8.1 
Construction and decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects located in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As set out in 
section 4.7 of this PEIR, the project with the most potential for simultaneous 
construction effects is the Covanta RRF to be developed to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site.  Construction phase mitigation measures will be 
employed during the construction of the Covanta RRF which are likely to  be 
similar to the embedded mitigation measures that would be proposed for the 
Applicant's Project, as set out in Section 6.3, with the resulting impact being 
not significant.   
Operation 
6.8.2 
The proposed Covanta RRF will release both oxides of nitrogen and carbon 
monoxide from the combustion process.  However, the exhaust stack for the 
Covanta RRF will be much higher than the stack(s) for the Project and 
therefore the location of maximum ground level concentrations will be 
different.  In addition, based on the preliminary assessment, as the maximum 
concentrations from the Project are unlikely to be significant in their own right, 
it is anticipated that the emissions to air from the Project will be not significant 
in conjunction with emissions to air from the Covanta RRF Project.

Summary and Conclusions 
6.9.1 
Based on the above assessment methodology, the baseline data, significance 
criteria, and the initial air dispersion modelling results presented in this 
section 6 of the PEIR, a full air quality assessment is being undertaken as 
part of the EIA to determine whether there would be any likely significant 
environmental impacts arising from the Project, (both in isolation and in 
conjunction with other significant emissions sources identified  through 
consultation with the relevant authorities) and will be presented in the ES. 
Based on this preliminary assessment, it is not considered that there will be 
any significant environmental effects on air quality arising from the Project, 
alone or in combination with other plans or projects in the area of the Project 
Site.  A summary of this assessment is provided in Table 6.15 below.

1 Construction is assumed to occur during the daytime only, operation may occur during the daytime or 
night-time. 
2 NSRs to construction will also be NSRs to decommissioning. 
7.2.3 
The NSR locations in Table 7.1 above were chosen as they are the closest 
residential receptors to the Project Site. The closest residential receptors 
have also defined the study area for the assessment.  
7.2.4 
A noise meter was set up approximately 50 m to the east of South Pillinge 
Farm and left unattended for five-days in order to measure the existing typical 
background noise levels.  
7.2.5 
The survey was undertaken between 14 and 18 August 2014. The weather 
conditions were suitable for environmental noise surveys throughout the 
survey period. 
7.2.6 
Measurements were taken continuously of the LA10,T, LA90,T, LAeq,T, and LAFmax 
sound pressure levels over 15-minute periods. 
7.2.7 
Appendix 7.1 of this PEIR provides details of acoustic terminology and the 
instrumentation used during the survey. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
78 
7.2.8 
Onsite calibration checks were undertaken before and after each set of 
measurements. 
7.2.9 
Windshields were fitted over the microphones at all times during the survey 
period. 
7.2.10 Noise levels measured at South Pillinge Farm are considered representative 
of the noise levels at Pillinge Cottages and Morteyne House, given their close 
proximity.  
7.2.11 The Public Protection Officer at CBC has agreed (verbally) that one noise 
measurement location at South Pillinge Farm would be sufficient for the noise 
and vibration preliminary assessment for the purposes of this PEIR.  
7.2.12 The existing likely baseline conditions at the remaining NSRs will be 
determined by way of an attended noise survey to be undertaken as part of 
the EIA for the Project and included in the final ES. Discussions are ongoing 
between the Applicant and CBC to agree a noise survey methodology and 
suitable locations for these measurement positions.  
Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
7.2.13 In respect of noise and vibration, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of 
this PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 
40 m high stack.  
7.2.14 The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to noise 
and vibration impacts are that an increasing number of separate gas turbine 
generators, each with their own dedicated stack will produce increasingly 
more noise. Noise from the gas turbine generator units is attenuated by the 
turbine casing, and so varies little with higher power output turbines. The 
main variable noise producing element is exhaust noise through the top of the 
stack. The noise output from five separate low power SCGT units will be 
higher than that produced by one or two high power units. Similarly, the 
construction of five separate SCGT units will result in a longer construction 
lead time, which will increase the noise impact at sensitive receptors. This 
applies regardless of whether we are assessing aero-derivative or industrial 
units. 
7.2.15 A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection is 
presented in this section. The worst case Electrical Connection of two double 
circuit overhead lines and seven new towers (one of which will be replacing 
an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net additional towers) has been 
assessed.  
Construction and Decommissioning  
7.2.16 The likely construction and decommissioning noise levels that may arise on 
development of the Project have been predicted using general information 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
79 
regarding proposed activities and the methodology set out in BS 5228 as 
follows: 
� 
Obtain an activity LAeq,T (by direct measurement of similar plant in the 
same mode of operation, or use the indicative plant noise sound pressure 
values provided in Annexes C and D of BS 5228); 
� 
Correct the LAeq,T for distance, ground attenuation, reflections, screening 
and on-time as applicable; and 
� 
Logarithmically add the individual LAeq,T to predict the total LAeq,T at the 
NSR. 
7.2.17 Information regarding the noise output of specific items of plant such as an 
excavator, steam roller, compactor and welder likely to be involved in the 
construction and decommissioning of the Project have been taken from the 
BS 5228 database. The noise levels from all plant items have then been 
combined to assume a worst case scenario for noise relating to the 
construction and decommissioning phase of the Project. 
7.2.18 Given the distances involved between construction works and the closest 
NSR (approximately 90m), it is anticipated that the level of induced vibration 
will be imperceptible at the nearest sensitive receptor. Construction vibration 
impacts are thus not assessed further. 
Operation 
7.2.19 The potential noise impacts during the operation of the Project are predicted 
using the SoundPLAN noise propagation modelling software, using typical 
values for the proposed plant items and considering directional and screening 
effects. 
7.2.20 The significance of the predicted operational effects can be assessed 
compared to the background noise level using the criteria provided in BS 
4142. BS 4142 advises that the measurement time interval for background 
noise measurements is “sufficient to obtain a representative value of the 
background noise level”. A 15 minute reference time interval has been used 
for the assessment of operational noise.  
7.2.21 Section 1, page 1 of BS 4142 defines the applicable scope of the assessment 
methodology. The Standard outlines that the methodology is not suitable for 
use when: 
“...the background levels are below about 30dB(A) and the rating level are 
below about 35dB(A)...”. 
 
7.2.22 The results of the ambient noise survey undertaken for the Project have 
identified that the background noise levels are below the threshold of 
suitability, therefore the use of the BS 4142 methodology may not lead to a 
reliable conclusion.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
80 
7.2.23 Despite this, consultation with CBC has determined that it requires the 
assessment to be undertaken using the BS 4142 methodology. Therefore, we 
have followed this methodology for the purposes of the preliminary 
assessment in this PEIR, but discussions are ongoing with CBC as to the use 
of the most appropriate methodology, which will be further discussed in the 
ES.  
7.2.24 Given the distances involved between the Generating Equipment and NSRs 
(minimum of 180 m), as well as the inherent design by gas turbine suppliers 
to limit vibration, it is anticipated that the level of induced vibration will be 
imperceptible at the nearest sensitive receptor (South Pillinge Farm). 
Operational vibration impacts are thus not assessed further. 
Significance Criteria 
7.2.25 Rather than following a matrix based approach as set out in Tables 4.1- 4.3 of 
this PEIR, determining the significance of noise effects for construction and 
decommissioning for residential dwellings is achieved by referencing the 
values shown in Table 7.2 below, which are set out in BS 4142.

I am surprised that the

low frequency and 
highly tonal nature of 
noise associated with 
this, and the 
potential for a significant 
impact, even at low 
decibel levels, I would 
expect the noise to be 
assessed.

7.3 
Embedded Mitigation 
7.3.1 
In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects of noise as a 
result of the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project, it 
has been assumed that certain elements of ‘embedded mitigation’ will be 
applied. These mitigation items can often be considered as standard, best 
practice working methods, without which the Project would not be allowed to 
be developed. In terms of noise, these standard mitigation measures include: 
� 
All calculations for construction noise assume a 10 dB reduction due to 
use of an appropriately placed acoustic screen, which is typical of this type 
of construction / decommissioning activity. 
� 
Inherent best practice plant design incorporating acoustic enclosures to 
limit operational noise.  
� 
Implementation of a CEMP; 
� 
Use of appropriately maintained plant and equipment during construction, 
decommissioning and operation.  
7.4 
Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
7.4.1 
The nearest noise sensitive receptor to the Generating Equipment Site is 
South Pillinge Farm, approximately 180 m west at its nearest point.  
7.4.2 
For the assessment of operational noise, the typical LA90,15min from the 
daytime and night-time measurements at the NSR have been used. To 
assess construction noise, the LAeq,10h will be determined by additional noise 
monitoring at the potentially affected NSRs. Table 7.5 below summarises the 
relevant noise survey results.

Assuming a worst case scenario, if all construction activities occur 
simultaneously, the predicted LAeq,10h is 55 dB at South Pillinge Farm and 54 
dB at Pillinge Cottages compared to a baseline level of 56 dB. However, it is 
anticipated that this worst case scenario is unlikely to occur. 
7.4.5 
The significance of the effect of construction and decommissioning noise is 
therefore predicted to be neutral as defined by the values in Table 7.3 above.

noise effects from the Power Generation Plant.

Operation 
Generating Equipment 
7.4.7 
At the time of writing, for the purposes of conducting a preliminary 
assessment of operational noise, a simplified approach has been taken, 
whereby the LAeq,T of the Generating Equipment has been assumed to be 85 
dB at 1 m from each of the Gas Turbine Generators. Although this is the 
figure reported by gas turbine suppliers, it is recognised that real world 
scenarios are often more complex given the interactions between individual 
plant items (e.g. stacks and cooling equipment). Therefore, the full noise 
assessment to be undertaken and reported in the ES will further break down 
the noise sources from individual items on the Generating Equipment Site.  
7.4.8 
Nevertheless, using a simple distance correction and applying a 5 dB penalty 
for likely tonal characteristics this results in an LAeq,T of 40 dB at South Pillinge 
Farm and 39 dB at Pillinge Cottages. This corresponds to a difference in the 
typical LA90,15min of 6 dB and 5 dB respectively and is therefore considered to

If all construction activities occur simultaneously the predicted LAeq,10h is 58 
dB at South Pillinge Farm, 53 dB at Pillinge Cottages, 53 dB at Lower Farm 
and 56 dB at Manor Farm. However, it is anticipated that this scenario is 
unlikely to occur.  
7.5.4 
The construction and decommissioning activities will only occur for a short 
period of time in each location as the active working width moves along the 
Gas Connection pipeline route. 
7.5.5 
The effect of construction and decommissioning noise is predicted to be 
neutral or up to slight adverse significance if all phases are conducted 
simultaneously.

Operation 
7.5.6 
During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the gas 
Above Ground Installation (AGI). This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type 
of noise as the AGI regulates the flow of gas from the NTS to the Power 
Generation Plant. 
7.5.7 
This noise is rarely perceptible. Given that there are no residential properties 
with a distance of less than 170 m to the location for the AGI, operational 
noise from the AGI is considered to be neutral. 
7.5.8 
Taking this into consideration and in line with the Scoping Opinion, 
operational noise from the Gas Connection has been scoped out of the need 
for further assessment.  
7.6 
Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
7.6.1 
For the assessment of operational noise, the typical LA90,15min from the 
daytime and night-time measurements at the NSR have been used. To 
assess construction noise, the LAeq,10h will be determined by additional noise 
monitoring at the potentially affected NSRs. Table 7.12 summarises the 
relevant noise survey results.

Table 7.13 provides the predicted noise levels associated with the typical 
construction and decommissioning activities in relation to the Electrical 
Connection. The calculations include activities associated with the 
construction and decommissioning of the substation and pylons but Table 
7.13 provides the total if all construction and decommissioning activities are 
performed simultaneously and therefore sets out the worst case scenario.

House. However, it is anticipated that this scenario is unlikely to occur. In 
addition, the worst case distance to the NSRs has been assessed (e.g. as 
close as possible).  
7.6.4 
The effect of construction and decommissioning noise associated with the 
Electrical Connection is predicted to be between neutral and moderate 
adverse and so is not significant for the purposes of the EIA Regulations.

Operation 
7.6.6 
At the time of writing no noise data is available for the Electrical Connection 
substation. No likely significant effects are anticipated from the Electrical 
Connection substation because of the inherently low noise levels generated 
from this equipment along with the distance between the equipment and 
nearest NSRs (minimum distance of approximately 100 m). However, this will 
be assessed in detail once noise data has been provided and as part of the 
EIA.  
7.6.7 
It is anticipated that the significance will be neutral and therefore not 
significant for the purposes of the EIA Regulations due to the distance from 
the substation to the NSRs and embedded and additional mitigation 
measures described in Section 7.3 and Table 7.14. 
Electrical Connection Overhead Lines (Dry Weather Conditions) 
7.6.8 
NPS EN-5 advises that high voltage transmission lines can generate noise, 
although this is usually limited to incidents when surface contamination on a 
conductor or accidental damage occurs during transport or installation. 
7.6.9 
At the time of writing, assuming a distance correction based on a line source 
and two new electrical circuits the predicted rating level of the Milbrook 
overhead Lines during dry weather is 10 dB at South Pillinge Farm, 3 dB at 
Pillinge Cottages and 24 dB at Morteyne House. This corresponds to a 
difference with the LA90,15min of -24 dB, -32 dB and -10 dB respectively and is 
therefore of neutral significance.  
Electrical Connection Overhead Lines (Wet Weather Conditions) 
7.6.10 NPS EN-5 advises that highest noise levels are generated by a line during 
rain, particularly during heavy rain following a period of dry weather. It also 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
96 
advises that whilst fog may also cause increased noise levels these are lower 
than noise levels during rain. 
7.6.11 It is anticipated that the significance will be neutral due to the distance from 
the Overhead Lines to the NSRs (approximately 90 m). 
Total Electrical Connection Operational Noise 
7.6.12 Further assessment will be undertaken once information regarding the 
overhead lines is available but it is anticipated that the significance will be 
neutral due to the distance from the substation and overhead lines to the 
NSRs and the available mitigation measures. 
Operational Access Routes 
7.6.13 Noise from the small number of vehicles associated with the operation of the 
Electrical Connection (e.g. only infrequent maintenance visits of around 1 
every few months and no operational staff) will not cause a significant 
increase compared to the existing road traffic noise.  
7.6.14 Table 7.15 below summarises the preliminary assessment of operational 
noise and vibration effects from the Electrical Connection.

Project as a Whole 
7.7.1 
The Summary of Effects Table 7.18 below includes a section on the effects of 
the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection). 
7.7.2 
None of the elements of the Project will give rise to likely significant effects 
alone, and will not do so in combination either.  
7.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
7.8.1 
It is considered that due to distance attenuation, only the Covanta RRF 
Project and the integrated waste management facilities at Rookery South Pit 
have the potential to have a cumulative effect with the Project in terms of 
construction noise from the developments listed in Section 4 of this PEIR. 
However, the integrated waste management facility is only a very high level 
concept at the moment and hence no detailed noise data is available. Should 
this progress further, then further details will be included with the ES.  
7.8.2 
It is highly unlikely that the noisiest operations at the Covanta site will occur 
simultaneously with the noisiest operations at the Millbrook development. 
Furthermore, it is unlikely that these operations would occur near the west 
boundaries of both sites (which are closer to the nearby South Pillinge Farm). 
The construction noise action levels for both sites at nearby noise sensitive 
premises should be similar. Therefore as an absolute worst case, the noise 
impact would increase by around 3 dB. This is generally considered to not 
constitute a significant increase. The local and temporary nature of the 
cumulative construction noise effect should further reduce the significance of 
the effect to negligible. 
Operation 
 Covanta RRF Project 
7.8.3 
The DCO granted for the Covanta RRF Project dated 2011sets out the noise 
limits provided in Table 7.16 below.

Assuming the total plant noise emissions from the proposed Covanta RRF 
Project will be designed to meet the proposed criteria (and not be any lower) 
set out in Table 7.16 above and will include the BS4142 5 dB penalty, the 
worst case cumulative noise impact at the two relevant noise sensitive 
locations will be around 1 dB higher than these limits when taken into 
consideration with the Project. This is a negligible increase and based on this 
preliminary assessment, it is considered that the cumulative impact should be 
classed as not significant taking into consideration the intermittent operation 
of the proposed Power Generation Plant Site. Table 7.17 below presents the 
results of the preliminary cumulative assessment in relation to noise and 
vibration impacts.

Integrated Waste Management progresses and noise data become available, 
it will be included in the cumulative impact assessment in the ES.  
Brogborough Wind Energy Project

The Brogborough Wind Energy Project is approximately 4.5 km from the 
NSRs in the vicinity of the Project Site; therefore no cumulative impact is 
anticipated.

Ecology 
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 
This section of the PEIR presents the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of likely significant ecological effects arising from the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Project. The potential for effects associated with 
potential habitat loss or species disturbance during each phase of the Project 
are identified, along with key ecological receptors that warrant further 
consideration in the ES.   
8.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
8.2.1 
Relevant policy and guidance in relation to ecology is set out in Appendix 2.8. 
Assessment Methodology 
Study Area 
8.2.2 
The Project has the potential to have direct and indirect ecological effects. 
The distance of some ecological receptors from the Project Site and the 
mobility of others are such that ecological impacts have the potential to occur 
at some distance from the Project Site. For the purposes of this preliminary 
ecological impact assessment the study area is therefore considered to 
comprise the following as described in Section 1.1 of this PEIR:  
� 
Power Generation Plant Site 
� 
Electrical Connection; 
� 
Gas Connection (Route Corridor Options 1 and 2); and 
� 
The wider area: the area within 2 km of the Project Site in relation to desk 
study information on protected / notable species and non-statutory 
designated sites; and any statutory designated sites within 5 km of the 
Project Site (as explained further in paragraph 8.2.3 below). 
8.2.3 
The assessment of direct impacts of the Project is limited to the Project Site 
and no land outside of the Project Site will be directly disturbed. However, the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the potential 
to result in impacts on some ecological receptors, primarily as a result of 
changes to air quality and chemical deposition rates, in the wider area. The 
significance of these more distant potential impacts is therefore considered 
with reference to statutory and non-statutory nature conservation sites 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
108 
(Appendix 8.1, Figure 1b) within 5 km and 2 km respectively of the Project 
Site, in accordance with criteria in the EAH1 Annex F8 guidance. 
Desk Study 
8.2.4 
Existing data in relation to the Project Site and the wider area were obtained 
in order to secure a better understanding of the ecological context of the 
Project Site. Biological records in relation to statutory and non-statutory 
nature conservation sites within 5 km and 2 km of the Project Site boundary, 
respectively were obtained from Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity 
Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC). Records and other information in 
relation to protected and notable species were also obtained from BRMC up 
to 2 km from the Project Site boundary.  On-line resources, including data 
available through the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the 
Countryside website (www.magic.gov.uk) complemented information obtained 
from BRMC.  This information was supplemented by previous survey and 
mitigation work undertaken by BSG Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, 
including land within and immediately north of the Survey Site (PBA, 2009; 
BSG Ecology 2013).  
Field Surveys 
8.2.5 
A wide range of habitat and protected or notable species surveys were 
undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 to inform the preliminary assessment. 
The information below confirms the field surveys that have been undertaken, 
their timing and the extent of the study area relevant to each survey type.   
� 
Extended Phase 1 habitat survey - February 2014 and updated throughout 
the survey season); study area is the Project Site as reported in the 
Project Scoping Report (see Appendix 8.1, Figure 2);  
� 
Terrestrial invertebrates surveys (between May and July 2014; to be 
completed in early-September 2014); habitat within the Project Site as 
reported in the Project Scoping Report assessed as having potential to 
support a valued invertebrate assemblage was surveyed (see Appendix 
8.2, Figure 1); 
� 
Great crested newt surveys (between mid-April and mid-June 2014); 
ponds within the Project Site and within 250 m of the Project Site were 
surveyed (see Appendix 8.3, Figure 1); 
� 
Reptile surveys (between end-April and end-July 2014; to be completed in 
late-August 2014); suitable habitat within the Project Site was surveyed 
(see Appendix 8.3, Figure 3); 
� 
Breeding bird surveys (April, May and June 2014) the Project Site, plus a 
50m buffer were surveyed (see Appendix 8.4, Figures 1 to 3);

8.2.6 
A summary of the survey methodologies and results is provided in 
Appendices 8.1 to 8.5, inclusive of this PEIR. 
Impact Assessment 
8.2.7 
This preliminary ecological assessment has been undertaken in accordance 
with guidance set out in the Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management’s (IEEM) Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (2006) 
(‘the IEEM Guidelines’) in order to provide “clear and concise information 
about the likely significant ecological effects associated with the project”.   
8.2.8 
The significance of impacts have been determined in accordance with the EIA 
Regulations and the IEEM Guidelines.  It is considered inappropriate to 
attempt to investigate in detail all potential ecological issues in relation to the 
Project. It is therefore necessary, in accordance with the EIA Regulations, to 
focus on those activities that could potentially generate significant ecological 
effects on Key Ecological Receptors.’ This preliminary assessment has 
therefore focussed on assessing the value of the relevant ecological 
receptors where there is the potential for significant effects to arise. 
8.2.9 
In order to determine the likelihood of a significant ecological effect, it is 
necessary to identify whether a receptor is sufficiently valuable for a 
significant effect upon it to be material in decision-making. To achieve this, 
where possible, animal species and their populations have been valued on 
the basis of a combination of their rarity, status and distribution, using 
contextual information where it exists. Habitats and plant communities have 
been evaluated against existing selection criteria, wherever possible (such as 
those developed to aid the designation of SSSIs or non-statutory designated 
sites). Only those receptors that it is considered could experience significant 
effects (i.e. effects that could adversely affect the integrity of the habitat or the 
favourable conservation status of a species’ local population), and which were 
identified as being of sufficient value to be material to decision-making (i.e. of 
‘District’ level importance or above), have been classified as being Key 
Ecological Receptors and will be considered in full in the detailed assessment 
to be carried out as part of the EIA and presented in the ES. 
8.2.10 The habitats and features within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) – i.e, the total 
area which may be affected by the Project are known as the ‘ecological 
receptors’. The nature conservation importance/value of each of the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
110 
ecological ‘receptors’ considers the protected species and species of 
conservation concern that they may support.  
8.2.11 This preliminary assessment and the detailed assessment that will be 
undertaken for the EIA and included in the ES will therefore examine impacts 
on receptors with reference to timescales; the area affected; and receptors, 
be they habitats or species. For each ecological receptor within the study 
area, the baseline is identified and evaluated; relevant effects characterised; 
impacts defined and their significance assessed; mitigation identified and 
residual impacts reported. This exercise is performed for each ecological 
receptor, for each phase of the Project.   
Valuation of Ecological Resources 
8.2.12 The ecological value of each ecological receptor within the study area has 
been determined having regard to its conservation importance. 
8.2.13 The IEEM Guidelines recognise that evaluation is a complex process and that 
there are a number of contributory factors in determining the value of 
ecological resources. The IEEM Guidelines confirm that assigning value is a 
matter of professional judgement guided by the importance and relevance of 
a number of factors including designation and legislative protection as well as 
biodiversity 
value, 
potential 
value 
and 
secondary/supporting 
value. 
Consideration of each ecological receptor having regard to these factors 
allows each ecological resource to be valued with reference to the geographic 
frame of reference set out below: 
� 
International; 
� 
UK; 
� 
National (England); 
� 
Regional (East of England); 
� 
County (Bedfordshire);  
� 
District/ Borough (Bedford Borough and Central Bedfordshire); 
� 
Parish/ Neighbourhood (Marston Moretaine, Stewartby and Millbrook); and 
� 
Local (all the land within the Project Site). 
8.2.14 Following valuation, the ecological receptors requiring full consideration in the 
impact assessment are determined. This allows exclusion of those ecological 
receptors that are of ‘Parish/ Neighbourhood’ or lower value. 
Establishing Potential Air Quality Effects 
8.2.15 The potential for impacts on sensitive ecological receptors, as a result of an 
increase in NOx either during the construction/ decommissioning or 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
111 
operational phase of the Project has been addressed in Chapter 6 of this 
PEIR.   
8.2.16 An assessment of the deposition of nutrient nitrogen and the acidity due to 
nitrogen as a result of operation of the Power Generation Plant will be 
undertaken in accordance with the EA guidance  “AQTAG 06  -  Technical  
Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate assessment for 
emissions to air” (2010).  
8.2.17 Critical loads (to be used as standards for the assessment of significance) will 
be obtained from the Air Pollution Information System (APIS) (see paragraph 
6.2 in Section 6 of this PEIR). Should the potential for likely significant effects 
be identified the implications in terms of the potential requirement for 
mitigation and/or management of vegetation and ecosystems (i.e. the habitats 
and species they support) will be assessed and presented in the ES. 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
8.2.18 In respect of ecology, the realistic worst case scenario from within the 
proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of the 
PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 30 
m high stack. 
8.2.19 Most chapters use a 40 m stack height as the realistic worst case scenario, 
however, the reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to 
ecological impacts are primarily because five smaller stacks will have a 
potentially greater impact on air quality (and therefore sensitive ecological 
receptors). Further discussion is provided in Section 6.2 of this PEIR. 
8.2.20 A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case Electrical Connection 
of two double circuit overhead lines and seven new towers (one of which will 
be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net additional towers) 
has been assessed. 
Significance Criteria 
8.2.21 The IEEM guideline state that impacts should be determined as being 
significant when they have an adverse or beneficial impact “on the integrity of 
a defined site or ecosystem and/or the conservation status of habitats or 
species within a given geographical area”. Such impacts may be significant at 
the level of importance defined in the evaluation section or, for habitats and 
species, at a lesser geographical scale. By way of example, limited impacts 
on a woodland of county importance might be assessed as being significant 
at a district level of importance. This methodology supersedes the matrix-
based assessment methodologies as outlined in Tables 4.1-4.3 of this PEIR.

8.2.23 A meeting was held with Natural England on the 12th August 2014, to provide 
an overview of the Project and to ensure that any concerns they have are 
addressed in the PEIR and the ES. This was followed up by further 
consultation on the 12th September 2014, during which the approach to 
determining the baseline for the preliminary assessment was agreed (as set 
out in detail at section 8.3 below).  The NE confirmed their agreement that it 
was unnecessary to undertake a HRA Screening Assessment, given the 
distance (27km) from the Project Site to the nearest Natura 2000 Site.  
8.2.24 Consultation has also been undertaken with CBC’s Ecologist (on the 
03.09.14), who has agreed, in principle, to the methodology and content of 
the assessment presented in this PEIR.  The need to demonstrate achieving 
a net gain in biodiversity as a result of the Project was raised as an issue to 
be addressed in the PEIR and EIA process.  This is being taken into account 
as the scheme design emerges. Off-site planting is proposed to the south of 
the Power Generation Plant Site; this will be designed to ensure value for 
biodiversity is maximised, whilst performing a landscape screening function.  
Given the negligible nature conservation value of the habitats affected as a 
result of the Project, it is anticipated that the creation of a new structurally 
diverse and species-rich area of planting, to reflect the species composition 
within the wider Marston Vale Forest, would be expected to result in a net 
gain in biodiversity.  
8.2.25 Consultation is currently ongoing with the conservation manager at 
Bedfordshire Wildlife Trust.  
8.3 
Embedded Mitigation 
8.3.1 
In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on ecology as a 
result of the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project, it 
has been assumed that certain elements of ‘embedded mitigation’ will be 
applied. These mitigation measures can often be considered as standard, 
best practice working methods, without which the Project would not be 
allowed to be developed. In terms of protection of ecology, these standard 
mitigation measures include: 
� 
Implementation of a CEMP which will set out best practice construction 
methods to limit impacts on ecology such as prevention of spillages and 
unnecessary disturbance of habitat.

8.4 
Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
8.4.1 
It will be the rate of habitat re-establishment and species re-colonisation 
following implementation of the LLRS, as opposed to the specific 
commencement date of the Project (being 2017), that will be the primary 
factor in determining baseline conditions relevant to this ecological 
assessment.  Towards the end of 2014, the base of Rookery South Pit it is 
expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are 
required for the LLRS.   
8.4.2 
The Applicant has carried out consultation with key ecological stakeholders 
(Natural England (NE) and CBC) and both NE and CBC have agreed the 
approach to determining baseline conditions for the ecological assessment as 
set out in this section of the PEIR.  The baseline for the ecological 
assessment is based on the assumption that certain elements of the LLRS 
are implemented, including re-profiling of Rookery South Pit. A full description 
of the works to be undertaken as part of the LLRS in Rookery South Pit, in 
advance of the Project construction phase is given in sections 2.6 and 4.7 of 
this PEIR. 
8.4.3 
Baseline ecological conditions (designated sites, habitats and species) are 
therefore determined on the basis of their predicted status and value during 
the construction phase, operation phase and decommissioning years taking 
into account the assumption that the LLRS will have been completed prior to 
construction of the Project in 2017. The base of the pit will be re-profiled and 
the footprint of the Power Generation Plant Site will be excluded from the 
habitat creation associated with the LLRS; it will not be returned to 
agriculture, or be subject to wetland habitat creation.  It will be maintained as 
a clay base, following the excavation of clay to win material for re-profiling 
works within the wider Rookery South Pit.  The baseline will therefore be 
informed by the desk and field studies undertaken in 2014, and professional 
judgment as to the expected rate of habitat re-establishment in Rookery 
South Pit following implementation of the LLRS, during the intervening period 
up to 2017.  
8.4.4 
The Extended Phase 1 survey February 2014 – Appendix 8.1 confirmed that 
the base of the south-western corner of Rookery South Pit presently 
comprises sparsely vegetated ground, swamp vegetation (including drying 
reedbeds) and bare ground.  Significant areas of the western half of the base 
of Rookery South Pit were levelled following completion of Phase 1 of a 
programme to translocate great crested newts (see paragraph 8.3.15 below).  
The surrounds of the pit comprise a patchy mosaic of bare ground, species-
poor neutral grassland and woodland/scrub habitats that have developed 
since clay extraction ceased. The access track comprises a mosaic of bare 
ground with ephemeral vegetation and scrub. These habitats are shown on 
the Phase 1 habitat map in Appendix 8.1, Figure 2 of this PEIR.

8.4.5 
The LLRS will guide planting on the Project Site and the margins of the 
attenuation pond and will contribute to delivery of ecological mitigation 
measures. 
Statutory Designated Sites 
8.4.6 
Desk studies identified that there are no Special Areas of Conservation 
(SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or RAMSAR sites within 5 km of the 
Power Generation Plant Site. Together, SACs and SPAs form the Natura 
2000 network, which aims to assure the long-term survival of Europe’s most 
valuable and threatened habitats.  The nearest Natura 2000 site is Chiltern 
Beechwoods SAC, which is approximately 27 km to the south-west of the 
Project Site.  As such, NE has agreed the Project is unlikely to result in any 
significant effect on the integrity of the special interest of any European Site 
and that a Habitats Regulation Assessment undertaken in accordance with 
the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) is 
not required.  
8.4.7 
There are seven SSSIs within 5 km of the Power Generation Plant Site, the 
nearest of which (Coopers Hill SSSI) is approximately 550 m to the south-
east.  The grid references and principal reasons for designation of the SSSIs 
within the study area are given in Appendix 8.1.  In addition, there are two 
Local Nature Reserves within 5 km of the Power Generation Plant Site. The 
closest, Flitwick Wood LNR is located approximately 3.3 km to the south-east.  
8.4.8 
Given the distances of these statutory designated sites from the Power 
Generation Plant Site, on the basis of this preliminary assessment no direct or 
indirect impacts are anticipated on any statutory designated sites, and as a 
consequence, they will not be considered further in the detailed impact 
assessment to be included in the ES.   
Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
8.4.9 
Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS) comprises Rookery North Pit 
and Rookery South Pit. Rookery South Pit will be directly affected by the 
Power Generation Plant; although by the time of construction the area to be 
affected will have already been re-profiled as part of the LLRS works. The 
access track, which is located along the western margin of Rookery North Pit, 
comprises bare ground with ephemeral vegetation, lined with scrub 
dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus mongyna), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), 
with young silver birch (Betula pendula) and alder (Alnus glutinosa) trees.   
8.4.10 At the time of the protected species surveys, the base of Rookery South Pit 
had been subject to dewatering operations, but still contained small areas of 
standing water and swamp habitat, along with areas of bare clay; all of this 
area will be re-profiled as part of the LLRS. By 2017, being the date of the 
commencement of the construction phase of the Project, these more valuable 
habitats within Rookery South Pit and recently associated with the Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS will no longer exist.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report

8.4.11 The desk study revealed that ecological surveys undertaken in 2008 – 2009 
showed the Rookery Clay Pit CWS to have supported a large population of 
great crested newts at this time, a small population of grass snakes and a 
medium population of common lizards at this time. The studies also confirmed 
that the Rookery Clay Pit CWS supported a valuable invertebrate fauna, 
along with numerous bird species of conservation importance (see 
Appendices 8.3, 8.2 and 8.4, for further information) in 2008-2009.  
8.4.12 At the time that the Project is constructed in 2017 it is assumed that all great 
crested newts and reptiles will have been removed from the base of the 
Rookery South Pit and surrounding area as part of the translocation operation 
currently ongoing (see paragraph 8.3.15 below). In addition, the LLRS re-
profiling works will replace any terrestrial habitat currently suitable for newts, 
reptiles, breeding birds and/or invertebrates within Rookery South Pit with 
clay, rendering it of negligible nature conservation value for these species.  
Nevertheless, the habitats and features of value supported by Rookery North 
Pit will be retained, and the potential exists for indirect impacts on this site of 
‘County’ importance for nature conservation.   
Other non-statutory designated sites 
8.4.13 A further 11 non-statutory designated sites are present within 2 km of the 
Project Site.  These include the large water bodies that dominate the base of 
the Marston Vale as well as woodland and grassland sites which are present 
both in the base and on the sides of the Marston Vale. The grid references 
and principal reasons for designation of these CWS are set out in Appendix 
8.1 of this PEIR.  
8.4.14 Given the distances of these other non-statutory designated sites from the 
Power Generation Plant Site, based on the preliminary assessment no 
impacts are anticipated on these other CWS within 2 km of the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  The potential for dust and particulate matter emissions 
from construction and decommissioning to have a significant impact on these 
ecological receptors is considered low, and they can be expected to be 
screened out from further assessment in the Air Quality Chapter of the ES 
(see Table 6.13). For the same reason these sites will not be considered in 
the detailed ecological assessment in the ES.  
Great crested newts 
8.4.15 Trapping and translocation of great crested newts (and reptiles) has taken 
place under a mitigation licence, issued by Natural England in 2011. This has 
affected the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS incorporating the 
southern portion of the proposed Access Road and a proportion of the arable 
land in the north of the Project Site. At the present time, the translocation 
programme is continuing in Rookery South Pit and is expected to be 
completed by November 2014.  
8.4.16 The existing access track to the north of the Project Site comprises areas of 
scrub, ephemeral vegetation and bare ground with cracks and crevices. 
These habitats, including the voids in the bare ground could be used by the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
118 
meta-population of great crested newts supported by Rookery North Pit 
during their terrestrial phase. Great crested newts are relatively common and 
widespread throughout the county. For example, the base of the Marston 
Vale supports several large and robust meta-populations (including in nearby 
habitats). Furthermore, the majority of the suitable habitat for great crested 
newts within the Power Generation Plant Site will already have been lost as a 
result of the LLRS. Overall the Power Generation Plant Site is therefore 
considered to be of ‘Local’ value for great crested newts.    
8.4.17 Whilst the value of the Power Generation Plant Site for the local great crested 
newt population is not sufficient to trigger consideration in the detailed impact 
assessment process in the ES, the potential exists for construction of the 
Access Road to have an impact on great crested newts using suitable 
features associated with terrestrial habitat along the route of the proposed 
Access Road.  For this reason, great crested newts will be considered in the 
ES as an ‘other ecological receptor requiring mitigation for legislation 
purposes’. The need for a derogation licence for works to proceed will be 
reviewed with Natural England, and an appropriate mitigation strategy 
devised accordingly, if required.  
Reptiles 
8.4.18 The existing access track to the west of the Power Generation Plant Site 
comprises areas of scrub, ephemeral vegetation and bare ground with cracks 
and crevices which could be used by common species of reptiles associated 
with Rookery North Pit. Given that the majority of the suitable habitat will be 
lost as a result of the LLRS prior to commencement of the construction phase 
of the Project in 2017, that other similar habitat is widespread in Marston Vale 
and the surrounding area and that only small to medium populations of 
reptiles have been confirmed to date, the Power Generation Plant Site is 
considered to be of ‘Local’ value for the local reptile population. 
8.4.19 Whilst the value of the Power Generation Plant Site for the local reptile 
population is not sufficient to trigger consideration in the detailed impact 
assessment process in the ES, the potential exists for construction of the 
Access Road to have an impact on reptiles using terrestrial habitat along the 
route of the proposed Access Road.  For this reason, reptiles will be 
considered in the ES as an ‘other ecological receptor requiring mitigation for 
legislation purposes’.  
Breeding Birds 
8.4.20 A relatively diverse assemblage of 65 species of breeding birds (either 
confirmed or potentially breeding) was recorded during the surveys.  Of these, 
31 species appear on one or more schedules or lists of species of 
conservation importance (see Appendix 8.4 for more information).  The 
majority of these were recorded within Rookery South Pit, which is subject to 
the ongoing LLRS and will be re-profiled before the construction phase of the 
Project in 2017.  The areas of scrub along the existing access track can be 
expected to support nesting birds, and during the 2014 surveys a pair of song 
thrush were confirmed breeding, along with probable breeding white throat

119 
(two pairs) bullfinch, turtle dove, stock dove and dunnock.  Given that the 
most valuable habitats within Rookery South Pit will have been lost ahead of 
the time of construction (as part of the LLRS), the remaining habitats within 
the Power Generation Plant Site are considered to be of ‘Local’ value to 
breeding birds.  This is not of sufficient ecological value to be considered in 
the detailed impact assessment in the ES.   
8.4.21 Nevertheless, all wild birds and their nests are protected under the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act (1981) as amended and breeding birds will therefore be 
included as an ‘other receptor requiring mitigation for legislative purposes’ in 
the ES. 
Bats 
8.4.22 A diverse bat assemblage was recorded during the activity and automated 
static bat detector surveys undertaken in May and July 2014, which focussed 
on the access track to the west of Rookery North Pit.  A total of nine species 
were recorded, including barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus), noctule 
(Nyctalus noctula), Leisler’s (N. leisleri), serotine (Eptesicus serotinus), long-
eared bat (Plecotus auritus), Myotis spp. Nathusius’ pipistrelle (Pipistrellus 
nathusii), common pipistrelle (P. pipistrellus) and soprano pipistrelle (P. 
pygmaeus) bats. Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded most 
frequently; further information is provided in Appendix 8.5.  
8.4.23 The majority of bats were recorded foraging and commuting along the scrub-
lined access track, which constitutes a ‘green corridor’, linking the known bat 
roosts at South Pillinge Farm (see below) with valuable foraging habitat to the 
north, associated with Rookery North Pit and beyond.   
8.4.24 Although a diverse assemblage of bats have been recorded using the Power 
Generation Plant Site, albeit it in relatively small numbers (with the exception 
of common and soprano pipistrelle bats), similar habitats are widespread 
elsewhere within Marston Vale, where similar bat assemblages would be 
expected associated with wetlands and surrounding habitats.  The Power 
Generation Plant Site is considered to be of ‘Parish/ Neighbourhood’ 
importance for the local bat population. This is not of sufficient ecological 
value to be considered in the detailed impact assessment in the ES.  
Nevertheless, bats will be considered as an ‘other receptor requiring 
mitigation for legislative purposes’ in the ES chapter. In particular, associated 
with maintaining the ecological functionality of the corridor.  
Other mammals 
8.4.25 There are no features suitable for use by water voles or otters within the 
Power Generation Plant Site.  Although signs of badger activity were 
recorded in the vicinity, no setts were revealed during the surveys.  These 
species will not therefore be considered any further in the PEIR or the EIA 
assessment process.

Construction/Decommissioning 
8.4.26 The construction and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant has 
the potential for both temporary and permanent impacts on the ecological 
receptors that are assessed as likely to be present following the completion of 
the works comprised in  the LLRS.  Again, it is assumed that the re-grading 
works associated with the LLRS within Rookery South Pit will have been 
completed by the time of construction of the Project in 2017 and therefore, 
that the Power Generation Plant will have a lack of suitable habitat for 
protected 
species. 
The 
potential 
likely 
significant 
effects 
of 
the 
construction/decommissioning phases of the Project on ecology are therefore 
considered to be limited to the following: 
� 
indirect noise and vibration disturbance to species, including protected 
species, during the construction and decommissioning phase within 
Rookery North Pit; 
� 
loss, disturbance and/or fragmentation of scrub habitats on peripheral 
areas of the western edge of Rookery South Pit, including along the 
proposed Access Road; 
� 
lighting effects; and 
� 
Indirect air quality effects on retained CWS habitats associated with dust 
and particulate matter emissions.

Operation 
8.4.28 The operational impacts of the Power Generation Plant on ecological 
receptors are limited to the potential for emissions of NOx, nitrogen and acid 
deposition to have an effect on the retained habitats within the Rookery Clay 
Pit CWS, in particular Rookery North Pit (see Chapter 6: Air Quality). No other 
operational impacts are anticipated on ecological receptors. No Impacts are 
anticipated to result from the Access Road during operation given the very 
limited number of vehicles and hence limited exhaust emissions. This is 
summarised in Table 8.3 below.

Gas Connection and Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
8.5.1 
The baseline conditions of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are 
extremely similar in ecological terms, and were also assessed together as 
one large area for the purposes of the phase 1 and phase 2 protected species 
surveys. Therefore they have been grouped together for the purposes of this 
preliminary assessment.  
8.5.2 
The majority of the habitats within the areas proposed for the Gas and 
Electrical Connection comprise intensively managed agricultural land, 
characterised by large arable fields, with grassy field margins which are 
bound by young species-poor hedgerows. A small number of plantation 
woodlands, which appear to be relatively recent in origin (less than 30 years 
old) are present within the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
125 
Connection. These habitats are of local ecological value being common and 
widespread, and do not constitute a key ecological receptor.  
Invertebrates 
8.5.3 
The diversity of invertebrates recorded within the more interesting areas of 
habitat within areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection 
(woodland plantations, ponds and field margins), was limited. This is largely 
due to the intensively managed arable land and their associated field margins 
and managed hedgerows. The majority of the species recorded are common 
and widespread across England. Of the 155 species recorded, three are 
nationally scarce and eight are Species of Principal Importance, including 
beetles and moths.  Overall, the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Connection are considered to be of no greater than ‘Local’ value for the 
terrestrial invertebrate population they support. The assemblage does not 
therefore constitute a key ecological receptor and will not be considered in 
the detailed ecological impact assessment in the ES.    
8.5.4 
Further information is provided in Appendix 8.2 of this PEIR.   
Great crested newts 
8.5.5 
Surveys were undertaken of 13 ponds within 250 m of the Project Site in 
2014, to confirm the presence or likely absence of great crested newts.  The 
presence of great crested newts was confirmed in eight of the ponds, and 
eight ponds were also found to support common toad, a species of principle 
importance (s. 41; NERC Act 2006); full details are provided in Appendix 8.3 
of this PEIR.  
8.5.6 
The population assessments confirmed three small populations and one 
medium population of great crested newts, in ponds to the north, east, west, 
and to the south, respectively; as indicated in Appendix 8.3, Figure 2.  
Population C is supported by three ponds clustered to the east, within the 
areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connections.  The remaining newt 
populations are found in ponds adjacent to the areas proposed for the Gas 
and Electrical Connection, within 250 m of the areas proposed for the Gas 
and Electrical Connections.  
8.5.7 
Given that great crested newts are relatively common in the county, that four 
meta-populations of great crested newts have been recorded during the 
surveys, that a large population of great crested newts is associated with the 
receptor sites from the Rookery South Pit translocation, and that robust meta-
populations occur elsewhere within the base of Marston Vale, the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection are considered to be of no 
greater than ‘Parish/ Neighbourhood’ importance for the local great crested 
newt population.  
8.5.8 
Whilst the value of the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connections 
for the local great crested newt population are not sufficient to trigger 
consideration in the detailed impact assessment process in the ES, the 
potential exists for construction of the Gas Connection to have an impact on 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
126 
great crested newts using suitable terrestrial habitat within 250 m of Ponds A 
and R see Figure 2 in Appendix 8.3) which have been confirmed to support 
great crested newts.  The working width required for the installation of the 
Gas Connection is 30 m with a permanent easement requirement of 10 m.  
Suitable terrestrial habitat for great crested newts is limited to the areas of 
broadleaved plantation woodland, the field margins and hedgerows.  Neither 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 or 2 would have any direct impacts 
on areas of broadleaved woodland although it would cross two hedgerows/ 
field boundaries. However, these are greater than 250 m from Ponds A and 
R, and hence the likelihood of any impacts on great crested newts is 
considered to be low.   
8.5.9 
Nevertheless, great crested newts will be considered as an ‘other ecological 
receptor requiring mitigation for legislation purposes’, depending upon the 
final alignment of the Gas Connection route. The need for a derogation 
licence for works to proceed will be reviewed with Natural England, and an 
appropriate mitigation strategy devised accordingly.  
8.5.10 Further information is provided in Appendix 8.3 of this PEIR.   
Reptiles 
8.5.11 The ongoing surveys have already confirmed the presence of small 
populations of common lizard and grass snake within the areas proposed for 
the Gas and Electrical Connection, specifically associated with the Bletchley 
to Bedford railway corridor, field boundaries and areas of broadleaved 
woodland. Peak counts of adult common lizard and grass snake were eight 
and three, respectively further information is provided in Appendix 8.3, Figure 
3 of this PEIR.  
8.5.12 The suitability of reptile habitat within the areas proposed for the Gas and 
Electrical Connection is limited due to the intense management of the arable 
farmland.  There are more valuable reptile habitats in the surrounding area, 
including Rookery North Pit, and reptiles are widespread in Marston Vale and 
the county.  Based on the current survey information, the areas proposed for 
the Gas and Electrical Connection are considered to be of ‘Local’ importance 
for the local reptile population. This is not of sufficient value to constitute a 
key ecological receptor and as a consequence, will not be considered in the 
detailed impact assessment in the ES.     
8.5.13 Nevertheless, reptiles are afforded protection under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act (1981) as amended, against intentional killing and injury.  It 
will therefore be appropriate to implement precautionary mitigation measures 
in advance of the site clearance works, to avoid incidental mortality of any 
animals that might be present. For this reason, reptiles will be considered as 
an ‘other ecological receptor requiring mitigation for legislation purposes’.  
Breeding Birds 
8.5.14 The majority of the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection are 
of limited value for breeding birds, consisting of large arable fields, delineated 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
127 
by species-poor hedgerows and ditches. The majority of the species recorded 
are generalist species, breeding within the hedgerows, scrub and small 
wooded copses within the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical 
Connection with only skylark recorded breeding in the open fields.  
8.5.15 No evidence of breeding barn owls was recorded during the surveys of the 
farmhouse buildings.  A single barn owl was recorded incidentally foraging 
during the bat activity surveys, although the areas proposed for the Gas and 
Electrical Connection as a whole are considered to be of limited value to 
foraging barn owls, due to the intensive management of the agricultural land 
which has poor suitability for prey items.  
8.5.16 Overall, the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection are 
considered to be of Local value for breeding birds.  This is not of sufficient 
ecological value to be considered in the detailed impact assessment in the 
ES.  Nevertheless, all wild birds and their nests are protected under the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and, and breeding birds will 
be included as an ‘other receptor requiring mitigation for legislative purposes’ 
in the ES, to ensure the careful timings of vegetation clearance to avoid the 
bird nesting season.  
Bats 
8.5.17 During the bat activity surveys undertaken in May and July 2014, a total of 
four species were recorded. These were noctule, Myotis spp., common 
pipistrelle and soprano pipistrelle bats. Common and soprano pipistrelle bats 
were recorded most frequently; further information is provided in Appendix 8.5 
of this PEIR.  The majority of bats were recorded foraging and commuting 
along the edge of plantation woodlands, field margins and roadside species-
poor hedgerows.  
8.5.18 Emergence and return to roost surveys of the building complex at South 
Pillinge Farm confirmed the continued presence of bat roosts (previously 
identified during the 2009 surveys undertaken at the Power Generation Plant 
Site).  A small number of small, non-breeding summer roosts for common 
pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle and brown long-eared bats were recorded 
within a brick-built barn building (B5), the farmhouse (B6) and a brick-built 
out-building (B8); further detail is provided in Appendix 8.5.  Whilst these 
buildings will not be directly affected by the Project, the potential exists for 
disturbance impacts associated with any bats using these roosts during the 
construction phase of the Gas and Electrical Connection.   
8.5.19 Although relatively common species of bats were recorded during the activity 
surveys, given the presence of confirmed bat roosts within the farmhouse 
buildings, the areas proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection and 
surrounding area is considered to be of ‘Parish/ Neighbourhood’ importance 
for the local bat population, and therefore are not triggered for inclusion in the 
ES chapter as a key ecological receptor. Nevertheless, the local bat 
population will be included in the ES chapter as an ‘other receptor requiring 
mitigation for legislative purposes’, to ensure the sensitive design, including 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
128 
lighting design, to avoid or minimise impacts on roosting, foraging and 
commuting bats.   
Badgers 
8.5.20 A single badger sett was recorded within the wooded copse within the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection This sett comprised six well-
used entrance holes, and may constitute either a large ‘subsidiary’ or a small 
‘main’ sett.  In any event, the sett would not be affected by the current options 
for the Gas Connection. The large arable fields are considered to be of limited 
value to foraging badgers, with more valuable habitat being provided by the 
areas of plantation woodland.  Overall, the areas proposed for the Gas and 
Electrical Connection are considered to be of ‘Local’ value to the badger 
population.  Therefore, based on the preliminary assessment the need to 
include an assessment on badgers has been scoped out of the ES.  
Other mammals 
8.5.21 No signs of water voles were recorded during the surveys within the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection.  The ditches were 
considered to constitute sub-optimal habitat, as the majority were shallow in 
depth, shaded by trees and scrub and lacked fringes of emergent vegetation 
required for food and shelter.  Similarly, none of the features in the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection were considered suitable for 
use by otters, and they had limited connectivity to more suitable habitat in the 
wider area. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
8.5.22 Given the limited nature conservation value of the habitats within the areas 
proposed for the Gas and Electrical Connection, no significant impacts are 
anticipated as a result of the construction or decommissioning of either Gas 
Connection or Electrical Connection.  The worst case Electrical Connection  
comprises of up to two double circuit overhead lines and up to seven 
additional new towers (one of which will replace an existing tower) between 
the existing 400 kV overhead line and a sub-station that is likely to be 
constructed adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site.  Two options are 
currently being considered for the Gas Connection, and although the potential 
exists for habitats to be affected which could support protected species, 
potentially including great crested newts, reptiles and/or breeding birds, any 
impacts are expected to be limited in nature as the working width required for 
the installation of the Gas Connection is 30 m with a permanent easement 
requirement of 10 m.  Both options 1 and 2 have been assessed.  
8.5.23 The preliminary findings of the assessment of effects on ecology on the 
construction/ decommissioning of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are presented in Table 8.4 and 8.5 below.

Operation 
8.5.24 Based on this preliminary ecological assessment, no likely significant effects  
on ecology are anticipated as being associated with the operation of either 
the Gas or Electrical Connections.   
8.6 
Project as a Whole 
8.6.1 
The Summary of Effects Table 8.6 below includes a section on the effects of 
the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection). 
8.6.2 
No likely significant effects are predicted on ecological receptors from any of 
the individual elements of the Project or from the Project as a whole.  
8.7 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
8.7.1 
Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site. However, the preliminary 
ecological assessment set out in this Section 8 of the PEIR has shown that it 
is unlikely that there will be any impacts on ecological receptors as a result of 
the Project. Accordingly, based on this preliminary assessment, then given 
that the Project alone is not anticipated to have any effects on ecological 
receptors, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to 
any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.   As such, it is anticipated that 
no cumulative effects assessment is required.  
Operation 
8.7.2 
Operation of the Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the 
vicinity of the Project Site. However, the preliminary ecological assessment 
set out in this Section 8 of the PEIR has shown that it is unlikely that there will 
be any impacts on ecological receptors as a result of the Project. Accordingly, 
based on this preliminary assessment, then given that the Project alone is not 
anticipated to have any effects on ecological receptors, it follows that the 
Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to any likely significant 
cumulative or in-combination effects with other developments in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   As such, it is anticipated that no cumulative effects 
assessment is required.  
8.8 
Summary and Conclusions 
8.8.1 
A full ecological assessment will be undertaken for the ES which will provide 
further information on the ecological impacts of the proposed Project.  Based 
on this preliminary assessment, no significant ecological effects are 
considered likely to result from this Project when considered alone or 
cumulatively with others which have been consented in the area.  A summary 
of this assessment is provided in Table 8.6 below.

Water Quality and Resources 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
This section of the PEIR presents the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of likely significant effects relating to hydrology and flood risk arising from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.  Specifically, this 
section considers the following: 
� 
the potential for the Project to be affected by current or future flooding 
events arising from watercourses lying adjacent to or in close proximity to 
the Project Site;  
� 
the potential for the Project to increase flood risk elsewhere; 
� 
the potential for the Project to impact on the quality of water bodies; and 
� 
the potential for the Project to impact on water resources. 
9.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
9.2.1 
Relevant policy and guidance relating to water quality and resources is set 
out in Appendix 2.9. 
Assessment Methodology 
9.2.2 
The study area for the preliminary water quality and resources assessment 
extends to include the reaches of watercourse and surface water drainage 
infrastructure shown in Figure 9.1 as these have the potential for significant 
interaction with the Project.  The study area will be confirmed following 
consultation (on-going) with the EA and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel 
Internal Drainage Board. 
9.2.3 
To facilitate an understanding of the watercourses and associated structures 
and general landform of the area in and surrounding the Project Site, the 
Project Site was visited by a qualified Hydrologist from PBA in August 2014.  
Both the EA and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board 
have been consulted to identify the issues to be addressed and the scope of 
work required to be undertaken in order to prepare a Flood Risk Assessment 
(FRA) that is compliant with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). 
9.2.4 
Data collected to support preparation of this section of the PEIR and the 
subsequent FRA includes: 
� 
Topographical survey; 
� 
Anglian Water sewer records; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
139 
� 
EA flood maps. 
9.2.5 
In addition, and to further assess the nature of flood risk associated with the 
Mill Brook, a hydraulic model of the Mill Brook and its tributary has been 
developed using topographical survey of the Brook corridor undertaken in 
2009.  The hydraulic model extends from a point approximately 200 m 
downstream of the Marston Vale Railway and extends to include the Mill 
Brook tributary that lies in close proximity to the southern edge of Rookery 
South Pit, as outlined in Figure 9.1.  The hydraulic model is used to estimate 
water levels associated with flood events of different magnitudes or frequency 
(i.e. rarity). 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
9.2.6 
In respect of water quality and resources, the realistic worst case scenario 
from within the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 
2 and 5 of the PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each 
with their own 40 m high stack. 
9.2.7 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to water 
quality and resources are primarily because five gas turbine generators will 
require marginally more water during construction and operation for blade 
washing.  
9.2.8 
A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case scenario for the 
Electrical Connection of a double circuit overhead line and seven new towers 
(one of which will be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net 
additional towers) has been assessed.  
Significance Criteria 
9.2.9 
The significance of effects has been assessed through consideration of their 
magnitude, duration and nature and also the geographic context (i.e.: highly 
localised or widespread).  The significance criteria are outlined below in Table 
9.1 below.

the EIA process.  Table 9.2 below summarises the consultation responses 
received to date in relation to water quality and resources, and how these 
have been or will be addressed in the ES.

9.3 
Embedded Mitigation Measures  
9.3.1 
In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on water quality 
and resources as a result of the construction, decommissioning and operation 
of the Project, it has been assumed that certain elements of ‘embedded 
mitigation’ will be applied. These mitigation items can often be considered as 
standard, best practice working methods, without which the Project would not 
be allowed to be developed. In terms of protection of water quality and 
resources, these standard mitigation measures include: 
� 
Any surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons to be passed through 
oil/grit interceptors prior to discharge; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
142 
� 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any surface water 
that has the potential to be contaminated, will be allowed to enter directly 
or indirectly any water course, underground strata or adjoining land; 
� 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining 
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage 
and construction materials in order to prevent the contamination of ground 
water. Site personnel will be made aware of the potential impact on 
ground and surface water associated with certain aspects of the 
construction works to further reduce the incidence of accidental impacts; 
� 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted to a 
designated area with properly designed fuel tanks and bunds and suitable 
operating procedures. 
� 
Siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to avoid 
pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working guidelines to avoid 
spillages near watercourses; 
� 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored will 
be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single tanks will be within bunds 
sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity and multiple tanks or drums will 
be within bunds sized to contain the greater of 110 per cent of the capacity 
of the largest tank or 25 per cent of the total tanks contents; and 
� 
During operation, the EA will set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the Project Site under the Environmental Permit. 
9.3.2 
The British Standard Code of Practice for Earthworks BS 6031:2009 contains 
detailed methods that should be considered for the general control of 
drainage on construction sites. Further advice is also available in the British 
Standard Code of Practice for Foundations BS 8004: 1986. These will be 
taken into account 
9.4 
Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
9.4.1 
Rookery South Pit will be subject to LLRS works prior to construction of the 
Project in 2017, as described in sections 2.6.2 and section 4.7 of this PEIR.  
This will result in changes to watercourses, surface water drainage 
characteristics and the nature of flood risk within and in the vicinity of Rookery 
Pit.  The completion of the LLRS works therefore provides the baseline for the 
assessment of likely environmental effects relating to hydrological and flood 
risk associated with the Project. 
9.4.2 
The Mill Brook flows along the western boundary of the Power Generation 
Plant Site and drains a predominantly rural catchment of approximately 4.5 
km2. It passes through a culvert beneath the Marston Vale Railway Line and 
ultimately outfalls to Stewartby Lake a further 400 m downstream.  A tributary 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
143 
watercourse draining a catchment of 1.5 km2 joins the Mill Brook to the east 
of South Pillinge Farm, shown in Figure 9.1. 
9.4.3 
The EA's Flood Zone maps do not extend to include the Mill Brook 
watercourse and its tributary on account of the small size of the contributing 
catchment area.   
9.4.4 
However, the nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook has been 
assessed using a hydraulic model.  The model provides a series of design 
flood levels for the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 100 year plus climate change (i.e. 
increase in fluvial flows of 20 percent, as defined by the NPPF) events.  The 
modelling analysis suggests that floodwater may spill into the south-east 
corner of Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 year event. 
9.4.5 
Despite this, the Power Generation Plant Site landform is such that (i) the 
Generating Equipment Site is elevated above existing flood levels and (ii) any 
floodwater spill will be intercepted and routed to the Rookery South Pit 
attenuation pond as part of the drainage works which will be undertaken as 
part of the LLRS.  On this basis, it is anticipated that part of Rookery South 
Pit that will accommodate the Generating Equipment will not be affected by 
flooding associated with either the 1 in 100 year or 1 in 100 year plus climate 
change events.  
9.4.6 
Discussions are ongoing between the Applicant and the EA to confirm that, 
following implementation of the LLRS, the Generating Equipment Site would 
be classified as Flood Zone 2.   
9.4.7 
The Generating Equipment is also classed as Essential Infrastructure in 
respect of the Flood Risk Vulnerability Classification set out in Table 2 of the 
NPPF Planning Practice Guidance. Essential Infrastructure is classed as that 
which is essential to the needs of the country and includes ‘electricity 
generating power stations’9 .  
9.4.8 
Taken together, the Flood Zones and the Flood Risk Vulnerability 
Classification are used to provide a Flood Zone ‘Compatibility’ matrix, as set 
out within Table 3 of the NPPF Planning Practice Guidance (included as 
insert 9.1 below).  This matrix indicates that construction of the Power 
Generation Plant within Flood Zone 2 is appropriate from a flood risk 
perspective.

9.4.9 
Assessment of the water quality of the surface water bodies in the vicinity of 
the Generating Equipment Site has been undertaken since 19991011.  During 
this time, surface water samples have been taken from the lakes in Rookery 
South Pit (prior to the implementation of the LLRS) and Rookery North Pit, 
Harrowden Brook to the east, the drainage ditches to the south (the Mill Brook 
tributary) and west (Mill Brook watercourse) and Stewartby Lake. 
9.4.10 Analyses have included testing for a range of potential historical 
contaminants.  
9.4.11 The data8, 9 shows that the ammonia concentration within all of the water 
bodies is generally low.  The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) concentration 
is also generally low.

9.4.12 The data8, 9 shows that the sulphate concentrations within the Rookery North 
Pit and the Rookery South Pit lakes are consistently higher than those within 
the surrounding ditches and within the Stewartby Lake. The sulphate 
concentrations within the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit lakes are 
also considerably higher than the threshold for the protection of controlled 
waters (400mg/l) and the threshold for the protection of human health 
(250mg/l).  
9.4.13 The chloride concentrations and electrical conductivity are also generally 
higher in the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit lakes than the 
surrounding water bodies, although elevated concentrations are recorded on 
occasion within Mill Brook and Harrowden Brook.  The chloride 
concentrations are generally below the threshold criteria for the protection of 
controlled waters and for the protection of human health (a single exceedance 
recorded in the Rookery North Pit Lake in 2000).  The electrical conductivity 
values recorded within the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit lakes are 
intermittently above the threshold criteria for the protection of human health 
(no available criteria for the protection of controlled waters).   
9.4.14 The lakes within the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit (prior to the 
implementation of the LLRS) collected surface water run-off from a large area 
across the base and sides of the pits that are underlain by the Oxford Clay.  
The elevated concentrations of sulphates that have been recorded within the 
water bodies of the Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit reflect the 
naturally occurring high sulphate levels within the Oxford Clay.  The waters 
within the surrounding brooks and the nearby Stewartby Lake are also 
influenced by the geochemistry of the underlying Oxford Clay but to a lesser 
extent since these water bodies are subject to some degree of natural 
attenuation and/or dilution during periods of rainfall when flowing waters may 
be present within the brooks. 
9.4.15 The concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Semi Volatile 
Organic Compounds (SVOC), Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), dioxins, furans 
and pesticides have all been consistently below or very close to the 
laboratory detection limits and the data8,9 shows no evidence of contamination 
having occurred at the Power Generation Plant Site. 
9.4.16 The above information on water quality relates to sampling taken prior to the 
implementation of the LLRS.  The ES for the LLRS sets out a number of 
mitigating measures to be implemented in order to ensure that there will be 
no significant or residual effect on water quality as a result of implementing 
the LLRS.  The construction of the LLRS earthworks, including the 
construction of new drainage channels and attenuation pond within Rookery 
South Pit, requires dewatering of accumulated surface water with Rookery 
South Pit and the draw-down of waters within Rookery North Pit in a phased 
manner. The discharge of pumped waters from Rookery North Pit being to the 
Mill Brook watercourse is to be at a rate of 23 l/s, in line with the existing 
discharge consent.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
146 
9.4.17 The mitigation measures proposed during the construction phase of the LLRS 
comprise the following: 
� 
Earthworks operations undertaken in a phased manner with earthworks 
materials being stockpiled such that the surface water run-off is routed to 
either the proposed Rookery South attenuation pond or to a local sump / 
silt trap with allowance for silt to settle from accumulated waters prior to 
pumping off-site; and, 
� 
The use of environmental management controls and procedures such as 
bunding 
fuel 
tanks 
and 
locating 
refuelling 
points 
away 
from 
watercourses/drains. 
9.4.18 Upon completion of the LLRS, surface water drainage will be directed to the 
Rookery South attenuation pond, prior to extraction and pumping via a new 
pumping station with waters discharged by the LLRS Consent to Discharge.  
9.4.19 On the basis of the measures outlined above, the historic water quality 
information set out for Rookery North Pit, Stewartby Lake, Mill Brook and its 
tributaries, and Harrowden Brook is considered to represent a robust baseline 
within the context of water quality with which to assess the likely significant 
effects on water quality and resources arising from the development of the 
Power Generation Plant. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
9.4.20 A small amount of water will be required each day for the construction and 
decommissioning works (e.g. wheel washing and dust suppression) and 
hygiene. This water will likely be brought in by tanker mains water supply, and 
therefore no surface water or groundwater abstraction will be required. There 
will therefore be no impact on these resources as a result of water 
requirement during construction or decommissioning. 
9.4.21 Construction or decommissioning activities carried to develop the Power 
Generation Plant could require the disposal of water from the Power 
Generation Plant Site. Therefore all construction contractors will be required, 
in conjunction with the Applicant, to reach an agreement with the EA with 
regard to detailed methods of disposal. 
9.4.22 Based on the preliminary information for the Project referred to above and 
similar construction sites, it is likely that this water will either be treated and 
discharged to existing site drainage or it will be collected and tankered away.  
This will be further developed following consultation and further assessment 
and once the final design of the Project has been agreed. 
9.4.23 Table 9.3 below identifies the hydrological receptors that may be affected 
during the construction and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, 
the nature of the impact and how this is to be mitigated and presents a 
preliminary assessment of the likely significance of effects. Where further

Operation 
9.4.24 Occasionally (approximately monthly) it will be necessary to wash the blades 
of the air compressor section of the gas turbine(s) to remove debris that has 
penetrated the air inlet filters and become lodged on the compressor blades. 
This will be done at times when the performance of the gas turbine has 
degraded and will depend on the air quality in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
9.4.25 Any water generated during washing will be retained on the Power 
Generation Plant Site in a storage tank and subsequently tanked offsite by a 
licensed contractor for disposal at an appropriately licensed disposal facility.  
9.4.26 Table 9.4 below identifies the hydrological receptors that may be affected 
during the operation of the Power Generation Plant, the nature of the impacts 
and effects and how these are to be mitigated and presents a preliminary 
assessment of the likely significance of the effects of the operation of the 
Power Generation Plant on water quality and resources. Where further work

Gas Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
9.5.1 
The preferred Gas Connection Route Corridor Option, Option 1, is located 
immediately to the south of Rookery South Pit.  The Mill Brook tributary 
passes through part of the Route Corridor for Gas Connection Route Corridor 
Option 1 and 2, located to the west of the Midland Mainline Railway.  A 
further watercourse (IDB Watercourse 3(1)) flows to the north of the Route 
Corridor for Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 to the east of the 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
150 
Midland Mainline Railway.  Watercourse 3(1) drains a small, predominantly 
rural catchment to the north-west of the settlement of Ampthill. 
9.5.2 
There is no flood risk information available for the minor watercourses located 
within Gas Connection Route Corridor Options 1 and 2.  However, given the 
minor nature of the watercourses, the small contributing catchment areas and 
local topography, any floodplains would be limited to very narrow corridors. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
9.5.3 
The potential effects associated with construction and decommissioning of 
the Gas Connection (Route Corridor Options 1 and 2) would be associated 
with the installation of the underground pipeline by open-cut methods and 
construction / decommissioning of the AGI.  Table 9.5 below identifies the 
hydrological receptors that may be affected during the construction and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection, the nature of the impact and how 
this is to be mitigated and presents a preliminary assessment of the likely 
significance of the effect. The assessment applies to both Gas Connection 
Route Corridor Options.

Operation 
9.5.4 
Based on this preliminary assessment, it is anticipated that the operation of 
the Gas Connection would have no impacts upon water quality and resources 
as it does not require any water during operation, it will not be at risk from 
flooding, will not cause flooding elsewhere and will not cause the release of 
any silt or contaminants. As confirmed by the SoS in the Scoping Response 
the potential operational impact of the Gas Connection has therefore been 
scoped out of the assessment.   
9.6 
Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
9.6.1 
The area proposed to site the Electrical Connection (excluding the substation) 
includes some water bodies/minor watercourses/ditches/drains.  The upper 
reach of the Mill Brook passes along the western boundary of where the 
Electrical Connection is proposed and the Mill Brook tributary passes through 
the north-eastern part of the area. 
9.6.2 
There is no flood risk information available for the watercourses located within 
area proposed for the Electrical Connection.  However, given the minor 
nature of the watercourses, the small contributing catchment areas and local 
topography, floodplains would be limited to very narrow corridors. 
9.6.3 
The assessment of the substation, is as for the Generating Equipment Site as 
it lies adjacent to it.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
152 
Construction/Decommissioning 
9.6.4 
The potential effects on water resources and quality associated with 
construction and decommissioning of the Electrical Connection would be 
associated with the installation of the overhead lines / pylons and construction 
of the substation adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site.  Table 9.6 below 
identifies the receptors that may be affected during the construction and 
decommissioning of the Electrical Connection, the nature of the impacts and 
how these are to be mitigated and presents a preliminary assessment of the 
likely significance of the effects.

Operation 
9.6.5 
Based on this preliminary assessment, it is anticipated that the operation of 
the Electrical Connection would have no impacts upon water quality and 
resources as it does not require any water during operation. It will not be at 
risk from flooding and therefore will not cause flooding elsewhere and it will 
not cause the release of any silt or contaminants. As confirmed by the 
Secretary of State in the Scoping Response, the operational impacts of the 
Electrical Connection have therefore been scoped out of this PEIR and the 
assessment in the ES.

9.7 
Project as a Whole 
9.7.1 
The Summary of Effects Table 9.7 below includes a section on the effects of 
the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection). 
9.7.2 
No likely significant effects are predicted on water quality and resources from 
any of the individual elements of the Project or from the Project as a whole.  
9.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
9.8.1 
Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
assessment set out in this Section 9 of this PEIR has shown no likely 
significant effects on water quality and resources are anticipated to arise from 
the Project.  Accordingly then given that the Project alone is anticipated to 
have no likely significant effects on water quality and resources, it follows that 
the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to any likely significant 
cumulative or in-combination effects with other developments in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that no cumulative impacts 
assessment is required.    
Operation 
9.8.2 
Operation of the Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the 
vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary assessment set out in 
this Section 9 of this PEIR has shown no significant effects on water quality 
and resources are anticipated to arise from the Project.  Accordingly then 
given that the Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects on 
water quality and resources, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result 
in or contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects 
with other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is 
anticipated that no cumulative impacts assessment is required.

10 Ground Conditions 
10.1 Introduction 
10.1.1 This section of the PEIR presents the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of likely significant effects arising from the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project in relation to ground conditions, with 
consideration given to potential ground stability and contamination related 
impacts.  It also provides preliminary findings of the assessment of the likely 
significant effects of the Project on hydrogeology in the vicinity of the Project 
Site.  
10.1.2 This section is supported by a Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment report 
comprising a ground stability appraisal and a Tier 1 qualitative contamination 
risk assessment (herein referred to as PBA 2014) presented as Appendix 
10.1 of this PEIR.    
10.2 Approach 
Study Area 
10.2.1 The study area is defined by both the geotechnical considerations in close 
proximity to the Project Site and the potential for pollutant linkages between a 
source and receptor.  The spatial extent of a potential pollutant linkage 
depends upon the physical characteristics of the particular pathway under 
consideration, for instance the depth to a particular stratum and the 
permeability of the migration pathway.    
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
10.2.2 Relevant policy and guidance in relation to ground conditions is set out in 
Appendix 2.10. 
Assessment Methodology 
10.2.3 Assessment of the land and water quality at the Project Site is being 
undertaken by following a tiered approach as recommended within the 
industry guidance as set out in Appendix 2.10 as follows:  
� 
Tier 1 – a qualitative assessment of historical and published information, 
together with a site reconnaissance, undertaken in order to develop a 
preliminary conceptual site model and inform a preliminary risk 
assessment;  
� 
Tier 2 – an assessment of ground condition data using published generic 
assessment criteria to screen the site and establish whether there are 
actual, or potential, unacceptable risks; and 
� 
Tier 3 - detailed - a quantitative assessment involving the generation of 
site specific assessment criteria (SSAC). 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
159 
10.2.4 For this PEIR, Tier 1 and partial Tier 2 assessments have been undertaken. 
The Tier 2 assessment will be further built upon and reported in the ES, 
alongside the Tier 3 assessment (that will also be carried out and reported in 
the ES).  
10.2.5 In order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of contamination could 
potentially lead to harmful consequences a source-pathway-receptor 
methodology is adopted, with the underlying principle that the identification of 
pollutant linkages consists of the following three elements: 
� 
A source/hazard (a substance or situation that has the potential to cause 
harm or pollution); 
� 
A pathway (a means by that the hazard moves along / generates 
exposure); 
� 
A receptor/target (an entity that is vulnerable to the potential adverse 
effects of the hazard). 
10.2.6 Without a pollutant linkage, the contamination may be a hazard but does not 
constitute a risk unless all three elements are present. Therefore, in 
assessing the potential for contamination to cause a significant effect, the 
extent and nature of the potential source or sources of contamination must be 
assessed, pathways identified, and sensitive receptors or resources identified 
and appraised, to determine their value and sensitivity to contamination 
related impacts. The methodology adopted in this chapter is qualitative with a 
progression from factual information (stated with reasonable certainty) 
regarding the baseline conditions, to appraisal informed by professional 
judgement and expression of opinions on the relative significance. 
10.2.7 Baseline conditions for the Project Site have been identified using the PBA 
2014 Phase 1 report which present information on the geotechnical and 
geoenvironmental setting of the Project Site, attached as Appendix 10.1.  
These describes the types and locations of: 
� 
Potential Sources of Contamination (PSCs), based on identification of 
current and historic land use; and 
� 
Potential Geological Hazards (PGHs), (such as ground stability that may 
result from artificial and natural cavities, and foundation conditions that 
may be affected by compressibility, shrinkage/swelling of clay stratum, 
groundwater and drainage).  
10.2.8 The reports also identify the type and sensitivity of potential receptors 
(including consideration of human health, buildings, groundwater, surface 
water and ecological systems) and identification of possible migration or 
transportation pathways.

Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
10.2.9 In respect of ground conditions, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of 
the PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 
40 m high stack. 
10.2.10 The different options for the Generating Equipment have little bearing on the 
impact to ground conditions. Five separate units will have marginally more 
land take than a smaller number of units. However, as the Generating 
Equipment will all be within the previously excavated Rookery South Pit 
regardless of how many gas turbine generators are used, the impacts arising 
from the Power Generation Plant on ground conditions are similar for each 
potential configuration. 
10.2.11 A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case scenario for the 
Electrical Connection of a double circuit overhead line and seven new towers 
(one of which will be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net 
additional towers) has been assessed.  
Significance Criteria 
10.2.12 The significance of the effects is defined using a combination of the value of 
the potential receptor and the potential consequence of the effect.  Tables 
10.1-10.3 illustrate how the value of the receptor and the consequence of the 
effect determines the significance level of the effect which can be “not 
significant”, “minor”, “moderate”, “major” or “severe”. 
10.2.13 Significance of an effect is a function of the magnitude of impact (deviation 
from 
the 
baseline 
condition), 
the 
sensitivity 
and 
value 
of 
the 
receptor/resource, the duration and reversibility. A receptor is classified in 
terms of its value or sensitivity; the criteria used in this ground conditions 
chapter are described in Table 10.1 below. The classifications have been 
generated using descriptions of environmental receptor importance and value 
given in various guidance documents including NHBC 200812 and DETR 
200013. Human health and buildings classifications have been generated by 
PBA using the attribute description for each class.

10.3 Embedded Mitigation 
10.3.1 In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on ground 
conditions as a result of the construction, decommissioning and operation of 
the Project, it has been assumed that certain elements of ‘embedded 
mitigation’ will be applied. These mitigation items can often be considered as 
standard, best practice working methods, without which the Project would not 
be allowed to be developed. In terms of protection of ground conditions, these 
standard mitigation measures include; working in accordance with best 
practises, maintaining safe working practises and the use of correct and 
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 
10.3.2 During construction / demolition mitigation measures would be covered by the 
CEMP. The CEMP will incorporate appropriate mitigation measures that will 
be approved by the relevant authorities and adopted, such that it would be 
unlikely that any impacts would arise during construction.  
10.4 Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
10.4.1 The baseline for the ground conditions preliminary assessment has assumed 
that the LLRS works as noted in sections 2.6.3 and 4.7 of this PEIR will have 
been completed prior to the commencement of the development of the Power 
Generation Plant in 2017.

** - The maximum penetration proved by the PBA (2009) and CLA (2000) investigations was 7.4 m. 
Historical ground investigation data from approximately 3 km to the northeast of the Project Site recorded 
a thickness of 8.5 – 9.7 m (Williams, 1985).  BGS information indicates thicknesses of 6 m – 13 m (BGS 
1:10,000 map sheet) 
10.4.4 Following excavation of the unweathered Oxford Clay (‘Knotts’) from The 
Rookery for brick manufacture, the overlying weathered Oxford Clay 
(‘Callow’), which was not suitable for brick making process, was cast back 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
165 
into the worked pits as “Callow Clay Fill”.  The investigations undertaken 
within 100 m of the Power Generation Plant Site1415 have encountered Callow 
Clay Fill at all location at thicknesses in excess of 4.7 m, although more 
typically the thicknesses are in the region of 2 m, tapering to a thin veneer, or 
are absent altogether close to the pit edges. 
10.4.5 The base of the Oxford Clay has a persistent pyritic shell bed less than 0.5 m 
above the base.  This was unsuitable for brick making and typically accounts 
for the horizon of clay left at the base of the pits following the completion of 
clay extraction.  The ground investigations have typically encountered up to 
2.0 m of remnant Oxford Clay underlying the Callow Clay Fill, albeit that it 
was absent in some isolated areas. 
10.4.6 Along the western edge of the Power Generation Plant Site the ground levels 
rise from the base of the pit at approximately 28 m AOD to approximately 38 
m 
AOD. 
The 
slope 
is 
formed 
at 
an 
angle 
of 
approximately 
1(Vertical):2(Horizontal) to 1(V):3(H).  Boreholes situated on the top of the 
western slope have encountered 1.65 m – 3.0 m of clayey Made Ground 
overlying in-situ Oxford Clay (Knotts).  The borehole records indicate that this 
slope is formed from in-situ Oxford Clay deposits, i.e. it represents a cut 
profile rather than an embankment of entirely Callow Clay Fill. 
10.4.7 In addition to the geological stratum identified above, a horizon of engineered 
fill will be placed across the base of the Rookery South Pit as part of the 
LLRS.  Fill will be formed from reworked Oxford Clay deposits extracted from 
a permitted excavation area to the south of the Rookery South Pit.  Fill will be 
placed directly upon the Callow Clay Fill in the base of the pit.  Fill will be 
placed and compacted in layers according to predefined method statements.  
Across the footprint of the Generating Equipment Site, engineered fill will be 
placed at thicknesses of generally 1 m – 2 m but will be up to 3 m in places 
where existing topographic levels are lowest. 
Hydrogeology 
10.4.8 The main water bearing strata present below the Power Generation Plant Site 
are the Blisworth Limestone Formation and, to a lesser extent, the Cornbrash 
Formation and the Kellaways Sand.  The clay formations present (Oxford 
Clay, Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay) are all of low mass permeability 
and, as such, act as aquitards, retaining the groundwater bodies in the 
underlying water bearing strata.

10.4.9 The permeability of the Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and 
Blisworth Clay Formation has been shown to be extremely low and as such 
these strata can be considered as aquitards. 
10.4.10 The EA classifies the Kellaways Sand Member and Cornbrash Formation as 
Secondary A Aquifers and the Blisworth Limestone Formation as a Principal 
Aquifer.  However, site specific assessment together with extensive historical 
published information16 has shown that the permeability of the Kellaways 
Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation is 
relatively low and the quality of the groundwater within these strata is 
generally poor. Therefore, it is considered that these deposits do not 
constitute a significant water source for abstraction purposes and the Power 
Generation Plant Site does not lie within a Groundwater Source Protection 
Zone (as defined by the EA).  
10.4.11 In general, the Power Generation Plant Site is situated in a relatively low 
sensitivity geoenvironmental setting for the following reasons: there are no 
significant groundwater abstractions or source protection zones in the vicinity 
of the Power Generation Plant Site; the Minor Aquifers of the Kellaways Sand 
and Cornbrash Formation are of limited thickness, low permeability and poor 
quality; the Major Aquifer of the Blisworth Limestone Formation is of low 
permeability, poor quality and is protected by the overlying Blisworth Clay 
Formation. 
10.4.12 Further information on groundwater levels and previous groundwater 
monitoring is included in the PBA 2014 Phase 1 Report, included in Appendix 
10.1.  
Sites of Geological Importance 
10.4.13 The closest site designated for its geological interest is at Biddenham Pit, 
approximately 8 km north of the Power Generation Plant Site. It is designated 
for its outcrop of terrace gravel including interglacial mollusca and mammalian 
remains and Palaeolithic evidence. 
Geoenvironmental Conditions – Soils 
10.4.14 As part of historical ground investigations in Rookery South Pit, 10 trial pits 
were excavated and three boreholes were sunk in the base of the pit in the 
immediate area of the Generating Equipment Site. No visual or olfactory 
evidence of contamination was noted within any of these exploratory holes.   
10.4.15 As part of historical ground investigations, soil samples were taken from the 
north-eastern quarter of Rookery South for geoenvironmental laboratory 
analysis in order to target the area known to have been previously subject to 
deposition of Callow sludge waste.  None of the determinands tested showed

any evidence of elevated concentrations when compared to relevant 
assessment criteria.   
Geoenvironmental Conditions – Groundwaters 
10.4.16 The historical ground investigation works10,11 have included assessment of 
the water quality within the Kellaways Sand, Cornbrash Formation and 
Blisworth Limestone Formation.  Analyses have included testing for a range 
of potential historical contaminants. 
10.4.17 In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash 
Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been 
identified as being poor, with saline conditions reported from the historical 
investigations undertaken in 200912.  
10.4.18 Historical monitoring of water quality10, 11 within the Kellaways Formation and 
the Blisworth Limestone Formation has confirmed that the quality of the 
groundwater within the Kellaways Formation and the Blisworth Limestone 
Formation is similar in nature, with naturally elevated concentrations of 
electrical conductivity, chloride, sulphate, ammoniacal nitrogen, boron and 
zinc when compared to the relevant assessment criteria for the protection of 
Human Health (Water Supply Regulations 2000).   
10.4.19 Further historical groundwater monitoring data was supplemented by 
groundwater analysis of samples taken from the Kellaways Formation as part 
of more recent historic investigations.  Concentrations of ammoniacal 
nitrogen, antimony, boron, electrical conductivity, chloride, manganese, 
sulphate and zinc were recorded above the screening criteria but at 
concentrations that suggest that the groundwaters have not been affected by 
anthropogenic contamination. 
10.4.20 The concentration of VOC, SVOC, PCB, dioxins, furans and pesticides have 
all been recorded consistently below or very close to the laboratory detection 
limit and the data shows no evidence of contamination having occurred at the 
Power Generation Plant Site. 
10.4.21 Groundwater analysis for hydrocarbons has also been undertaken within the 
wider Rookery South are1011, for which there are no available assessment 
criteria.  During the more recent monitoring12, hydrocarbon analysis was 
undertaken and found to be below the detection limit for the test of 10µg/l. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
10.4.22 Due to historical clay extraction at the Generating Equipment Site, 
groundwater levels are close to existing ground levels (before completion of 
the LLRS) in the base of the Rookery South Pit.  Once the LLRS works have 
been completed in the Generating Equipment Site, groundwater levels are 
anticipated as being at circa 29 m AOD compared to an average development 
platform level for the LLRS of 31.5 m AOD. Whilst elevated Groundwater 
levels could present problems in any deep excavations for drainage or 
earthworks during the construction process and increase the potential for 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
168 
hydraulic uplift of any below ground structures, post-construction it is not 
anticipated that the Generating Equipment will have significant foundations or 
deep drainage requirements.  If any such issues arise, however, they are 
likely to be limited to the construction activities associated with the Power 
Generation Plant. 
10.4.23 Following the historical extraction of clay from the Rookery South Pit, there 
are relatively steep side slopes that show evidence of instability in places. 
However, the LLRS makes due allowance for remedial engineering via 
regrading of slopes and buttressing of slopes where necessary to provide a 
suitable slope profile. Any earthworks required for the Power Generation 
Plant would be consistent with the slope stability assessment undertaken as 
part of the LLRS to ensure that the Project does not compromise the integrity 
of such works. 
10.4.24 Whilst the Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments that have been undertaken for 
the Power Generation Plant Site have confirmed that the existing 
geoenvironmental risks associated with the Power Generation Plant are low 
or very low, there may remain a limited potential for small, localised, 
inclusions of potentially contaminated materials within any residual Made 
Ground/reworked deposits present at the Power Generation Plant Site. 
10.4.25 Construction and decommissioning activities in relation to the Project also 
have the potential to lead to diffuse pollution and / or an increased silt loading 
to the surface water run-off.   
10.4.26 Table 10.6 below summarises the preliminary assessment of potential effects 
on ground conditions in relation to the construction and decommissioning of 
the Power Generation Plant.

10.5 Gas Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
10.5.1 Both Gas Connection Route Corridor Options (being the preferred Option 1 
and Option 2 as set out in section 2.4 of this PEIR) are proposed on 
agricultural land to the south of the Power Generation Plant Site. The land is 
currently used for arable crops (wheat) but it does not represent the most 
biologically diverse best or most fertile land (see Section 8 of this PEIR for 
further details).  Furthermore, the construction footprint of the Gas 
Connection will be relatively modest (maximum of 1.7 km in length and a 
construction working width of maximum 30 m).  
10.5.2 The geological and hydrogeological baseline in the vicinity of the Gas 
Connection Route Options is similar to the natural strata which would have 
existed at the Power Generation Plant and the Rookery South Pit prior to 
excavation of clay.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
175 
10.5.3 Exploratory hole records for the area in which the Gas Connection would be 
sited are only present in the north-western corner of the area proposed for 
siting the preferred Gas Connection Option 1, close to Gas Connection Route 
Corridor Option 2. The records from within this area confirm the presence of 
‘reworked topsoil’ comprising soft brown slightly sandy slightly gravelly clay to 
around 0.2 m bgl. This was reportedly underlain by weathered Oxford Clay 
comprising soft and firm light orange brown mottled slightly sandy clay proven 
to around 3.5 m bgl . This was underlain by Oxford Clay recorded as firm dark 
green brown laminated very silty clay proven in the boreholes to depths of 
between 13.8 m bgl (BH4) and 20.5 m bgl (BH6). The Kellaways Formation 
was identified underlying the Oxford Clay, recorded as interbedded dark grey 
sand and firm grey green clay with occasional shell fragments. The Kellaways 
Formation was proven to between 19.75 m bgl and 24.65 m bgl in the areas 
investigated. The Cornbrash Formation recorded as dark grey fine to medium 
grained muddy limestone was identified underlying the Kellaways Formation, 
and was proven to a maximum depth of 24.9 m bgl (BH6). 
Hydrogeology 
10.5.4 The clayey deposits of the Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and 
Blisworth Clay Formation underlie Gas Connection Route Corridor Options 1 
and 2. They have been shown to be of extremely low permeability and can be 
considered as being aquicludes. Whilst the Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash 
Formation are classified as secondary Aquifers, they have been shown to be 
insignificant water resources due to their limited thickness, low permeability 
and poor water quality and are considered herein to act as aquitards. The 
Blisworth Limestone Formation has been shown to be of a slightly higher 
permeability but also of naturally poor water quality.  
Construction/Decommissioning 
10.5.5 Table 10.8 below summarises the potential effects on ground conditions from 
the construction and decommissioning of the Gas Connection (Route Corridor 
Options 1 and 2).

Operation 
10.6.4 Based on this preliminary assessment, it is considered that there are not any 
likely significant effects on ground conditions as a result of the operation of 
the Electrical Connection.  
10.7 Project as a Whole 
10.7.1 The Summary of Effects Table 10.10 below includes a section on the effects 
of the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection). 
10.7.2 No likely significant effects are predicted on ground conditions from any of the 
individual elements of the Project or from the Project as a whole.  
10.8 Cumulative effects 
Construction 
10.8.1 Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
178 
assessment set out in Section 10 of this PEIR has shown no significant 
effects on ground conditions are anticipated to arise from the Project.  
Accordingly then given that the Project alone is anticipated to have no 
significant effects on ground conditions, it follows that the Project is also 
unlikely to result in or contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-
combination effects with other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  
As such, it is anticipated that no cumulative impacts assessment is required.    
Operation 
10.8.2 Operation of the Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the 
vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary assessment set out in 
Section 10 of this PEIR has shown no significant effects on ground conditions 
are anticipated to arise from the Project.  Accordingly then given that the 
Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects on ground 
conditions, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute 
to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that 
no cumulative impacts assessment is required.    
10.9 Summary and Conclusions 
10.9.1 Table 10.10 below summarises the preliminary assessment of the potential 
impacts of the Project on ground conditions. No impacts have been identified 
as a result of construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. 
Further consultation is ongoing with stakeholders to ascertain the need, or 
otherwise for further phase 2 ground investigations.

11 Landscape and Visual Impacts 
11.1 Introduction 
11.1.1 This section of the PEIR sets out the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of likely significant landscape and visual effects arising from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project on the landscape as an 
environmental resource in its own right and on people’s views and visual 
amenity.   
11.2 Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
11.2.1 Relevant policy and guidance in relation to LVIA is set out in Appendix 2.11. 
Assessment Methodology 
11.2.2 The methodology for undertaking the LVIA is based on professional 
experience, alongside the Landscape Institute / Institute of Environmental 
Management and Assessment Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (third edition, 2013). 
Study Area 
11.2.3 A Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan has been created by selecting spot 
locations to simulate the tops of the stacks, assigning maximum heights of 40 
m above the floor of Rookery South Pit and electrical towers with a maximum 
height of 45 m above ground level.  The ZTV computer software processes 
landform data and other selected features influencing the extent of visibility 
(visual barriers), for example, woodland and settlements, in order to identify 
the theoretical extent of the area from which the Project is likely to be visible.  
It is important to note that the ZTV illustrates the worst-case scenario, in that 
it will only take into account the landform and principal areas of woodland and 
settlements.  In reality other features, such as hedgerows or street trees or 
isolated properties, are likely to provide additional filtering of views. 
11.2.4 The ZTV has been used to guide the initial selection of representative 
viewpoints to be included within the visual impact assessment and provides 
the maximum extent of the study area.  It has been tested on the ground 
during a site walkover.  
11.2.5 The ZTV is provided as Figure 11.1.  
11.2.6 A data trawl has been undertaken to establish the baseline landscape and 
landscape character information, including topography, landscape planning 
designations and published sources of landscape character or, where 
relevant, townscape character.  
Site Survey and Photographic Record 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
184 
11.2.7 The Project Site and surrounding area have been visited and a photographic 
record to represent views of the selected assessment viewpoints has be 
undertaken, in order to: 
� 
Determine the extent of visibility of existing built structures; 
� 
Determine the visibility of the Project, utilising the results from the ZTV 
plan to guide the field work; 
� 
Gain further understanding of the components which create the landscape 
character; and 
� 
Carry out the assessment of landscape and visual effects. 
11.2.8 The selection of viewpoints is made on the basis of the following types of 
publicly accessible viewpoints: 
� 
Representative viewpoints (for example representing views of users of a 
particular footpath); 
� 
Specific viewpoints (for example a key view from a specific visitor 
attraction); 
� 
Illustrative viewpoints (chosen to demonstrate a particular effect/specific 
issue); and 
� 
Any important sequential views (for example along key transport routes). 
11.2.9 Potential visual receptors include: 
� 
Public footpath and cycle route users, pedestrians; 
� 
People using public open spaces and parks; 
� 
People living in, working in, or visiting the nearby settlements of Ampthill, 
How End, Marston Moretaine, Millbrook, Stewartby, Lidlington, Houghton 
Conquest and the neighbouring isolated properties and farmsteads; and 
� 
People using roads or railways. 
11.2.10 The viewpoint assessment is illustrated by a range of tools including 
photographs and photomontages. The photographs used to produce the 
photomontages have been taken in RAW format using a Canon EOS 5D 
Mark II Digital SLR camera with a fixed 50mm lens. This camera has a full-
frame (35 mm negative size) CMOS sensor, therefore with a fixed 50mm 
lens, it provides a focal length that is in accordance with best practice.  The 
camera is mounted and levelled on a Nodal Ninja panoramic head at 1.5 
metres above ground to the centre of the lens.  The photographs are taken in 
landscape format at 20 degree intervals giving a 50% overlap between 
frames.  These are all individually cylindrically projected and then digitally

joined to create a fully cylindrically projected panorama with a 72 degree field 
of view.  
11.2.11 Photomontages of the proposed Development have been produced to provide 
an image of how the development might look in the context of the view.  For 
these photomontages the worst case layout of the Development has been 
modelled using several coloured ‘development envelopes’, related to the 
function and maximum height of each part of the plant.  The envelopes are 
modelled at the maximum height of the structures or buildings within each 
area and therefore represent a worst case scenario, showing the area in 
which development of the gas processing structures will be built.  Indicative 
wireline models of the proposed transmission towers are shown and a 3D 
model of the Covanta consented scheme has also been produced and 
included in the model.  These envelopes, wireline models of the proposed 
transmission towers and the consented Covanta RRF scheme have been 
used as the basis for visual modelling of the photomontages and the 
assessment of effects.  The 3D model was created in TOPOS 3D 
visualisation software package from an Autocad plan of the indicative layout 
of the plant and a schedule of the indicative dimensions and heights. The 3D 
model is positioned accurately in a digital terrain model and views are then 
exported and brought into Adobe Photoshop, where it is positioned accurately 
and rendered against the photograph to create a photomontage image. 
11.2.12 The model of the proposed Development, set within a computer-generated 
image of the landform is used in the assessment to predict the theoretical 
appearance of the development.  These are produced with 3D visualisation 
software and, as they are based on digital terrain and surface feature data, 
have the limitations with regard to local variations in landform and surface 
features.  
The 
photographs 
and 
other 
graphic 
material 
such 
as 
photomontages used in this assessment are for illustrative purposes only and, 
whilst useful tools in the assessment, are not considered to be completely 
representative of what will be apparent to the human eye. It should be noted 
that photography is only a tool to assist in the visualisation process, and 
cannot be expected to replicate the actual view or predicted view which would 
be attained on the ground. 
11.2.13 Six photomontages have been produced to support the assessment 
described in this PEIR and represent key viewpoints from potentially sensitive 
receptors. They are included in Appendix 11.1.  
 
  
Landscape Assessment 
11.2.14 The assessment of landscape effects assesses how the Project will affect the 
landscape components of the study area (the ‘landscape fabric’, for example: 
landform, land use, hedgerows and trees, public rights of way, ponds or other 
features), and the key characteristics which contribute to its distinctive 
character (the ‘landscape character’).  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
186 
11.2.15 The assessment of landscape receptor sensitivity has combined judgements 
on the value attributed to the landscape receptor and the ‘susceptibility to 
change’ of the receptor to the specific type of development proposed. 
11.2.16 The value of potentially affected landscape receptors has been assessed. 
Landscapes may be valued at community, local, national or international 
levels.  Existing landscape designations have been taken as the starting point 
for the assessment, and the value of undesignated landscapes have also be 
assessed. 
11.2.17 A methodical consideration of each effect upon each identified landscape 
receptor has been undertaken, in order to determine the significance of 
effects, in terms of: 
� 
Value and susceptibility to change (sensitivity of the landscape receptor); 
and 
� 
Size / scale, extent, duration and reversibility (magnitude of the landscape 
effect). 
11.2.18 Other factors which may influence landscape value are set out in Table 11.1, 
below. Table 11.2 describes the landscape receptor susceptibility to change 
Table 11.1: Factors Which Influence Landscape Value

Low 
Substantial ability to accommodate the proposed development 
without undue consequences for the maintenance of the 
baseline landscape and/or the achievement of landscape

Visual Assessment 
11.2.19 The preliminary assessment of effects on views and visual amenity has 
assessed how the Project will affect the views available to people and their 
visual amenity.  A methodical consideration of each visual effect upon each 
identified visual receptor has been undertaken, in order to determine the 
significance of effects, in terms of: 
� 
Value and susceptibility to change (sensitivity of the visual receptor, or 
viewer); and 
� 
Size / scale, extent, composition, duration and reversibility (magnitude of 
the visual effect). 
11.2.20 Visual receptors generally comprise users of public rights of way, public open 
spaces, public realm or other outdoor recreational facilities, and also 
travellers in vehicles who may be visiting, living or working within the study 
area, and their views at particular places. 
11.2.21 The following terminology has been used to describe the approximate 
distance between the representative viewpoint and the Project and is based 
on guidance set out in paragraph 11.2.2: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
188 
� 
Local:  
 
 
under 0.5 km; 
� 
Medium distance: 
0.5 km – 2 km; and 
� 
Long distance:  
beyond 2 km. 
11.2.22 The type of view, and the number of viewers likely to experience the view, are 
described in the following terms: 
� 
Glimpsed (i.e. in passing) / Filtered / Oblique / Framed / Open Views; and 
� 
Few / Moderate / Many Viewers. 
11.2.23 In line with the GLVIA guidance, which states that views should be from 
publicly accessible places.  However, where appropriate, representative 
viewpoints have been selected from publicly accessible locations within or on 
the edge of main settlements, property groupings or other buildings 
potentially affected by the Project. 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
11.2.24 In respect of LVIA, the realistic worst case scenario from within the proposed 
Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of the PEIR) are 
five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 40 m high 
stack.  
11.2.25 A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case scenario for the 
Electrical Connection of two double circuit overhead lines and seven new 
towers (one of which will be replacing an existing tower and is likely to be 
located in close proximity to that existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net 
additional towers) has been assessed. Towers are assumed to be 45 m high. 
11.2.26 The reason that the parameters identified above represent the realistic worst 
case in relation to landscape and visual effects are: 
� 
Larger stack heights increase the likelihood of visual impact;  
� 
Higher number of stacks increases the likelihood of visual impact; and 
� 
Overhead lines and new towers increase the likelihood of visual impact. 
Significance Criteria 
11.2.27 A three-stage assessment process has been adopted for the LVIA, in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Landscape 
Institute/Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Management and Assessment Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (third, edition 2013). Firstly, the nature of receptors (sensitivity) 
will be assessed. Secondly the nature of impacts (magnitude) likely to result 
from the Project will be assessed. Lastly, the significance of the identified 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
189 
landscape and visual effects on receptors will be assessed by a combination 
of the above. 
11.2.28 Effects may be temporary, permanent or reversible over time.  The following 
terminology will be used to describe the duration of landscape and visual 
effects arising as a result of the development of the Project: 
� 
Short term: 
 
less than 1 year; 
� 
Medium term: 
 
1-15 years; and 
� 
Long term: 
 
longer than 15 years. 
11.2.29 The nature of effects may be positive (beneficial) or negative (adverse) and 
direct or indirect.  Direct effects are those which result directly from the 
Project; whereas indirect, or secondary, effects may arise as a consequential 
change resulting from the Project, for example: changes to offsite and 
downstream vegetation as a result of alterations to a drainage regime. 
Landscape Criteria 
11.2.30 The sensitivity of a particular landscape considers the factors described in 
Tables 11.1 and 11.2 using the following typical criteria set out below in Table 
11.3.  
Table 11.3: Landscape Sensitivity

Description 
Medium 
An area with a clearly defined sense of place and 
character, and / or attributes which contribute to the 
landscape or landscape character, such as: 
• in moderate condition; 
• some scenic quality valued at a local or regional level; 
• landscape character intact and valued at a local or 
regional level;  
• an area with partial tolerance to change of the type

• no cultural interest; 
• an area that is tolerant of substantial change of the type 
proposed; 
• undesignated landscape; 
• a degraded landscape; and 
• strongly influenced by detracting land uses and 
buildings. 
11.2.31 The size or scale of change in the landscape relates to the loss or addition of 
features in the landscape which are likely to result from the Project, and takes 
into account: 
� 
The extent/proportion of landscape elements that are lost or added; 
� 
The contribution of those elements to landscape character and the degree 
to which aesthetic/perceptual aspects are altered; and 
� 
Whether the effect is likely to change the key characteristics of the 
landscape, which are critical to its distinctive character.

Visual Impacts 
11.2.33 The assessment of visual receptor sensitivity has combined judgements on 
the value attributed to the visual receptor and the ‘susceptibility to change’ of 
the receptor to the specific type of development proposed. 
11.2.34 The value assigned to views has had regard to a number of factors, including: 
� 
Recognition through planning or heritage assets; and 
� 
The popularity of the viewpoint, its appearance in guidebooks, literature or 
art, on tourist maps, and the facilities provided to enable enjoyment of the 
view. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
193 
11.2.35 The criteria for the assessment of the value of views is summarised in Table 
11.5 below; note that these are provided for guidance and are not intended to 
be absolute. 
Table 11.5: Value of Views 
Value 
Criteria 
High 
Views from landscapes/viewpoints of national importance, or highly 
popular visitor attractions where the view forms an important part of 
the experience, or with important cultural associations. 
Medium 
Views from landscapes/viewpoints of regional/district importance or 
moderately popular visitor attractions where the view forms part of 
the experience, or with local cultural associations. 
Low 
Views from landscapes/viewpoints with no designations, not 
particularly popular as a viewpoint and with minimal or no cultural 
associations. 
11.2.36 The susceptibility of people to changes in views is a function of: 
� 
The occupation or activity of the viewer at a given location; and 
� 
The extent, therefore, to which a person’s attention or interest may be 
focussed on a particular view and the visual amenity experienced. 
11.2.37 For the purposes of the visual impact assessment, visual receptors’ 
susceptibility to change has been  based upon the Table 11.6:

• Residents; 
• People engaged in outdoor recreation, including users of

views; 
• Visitors to heritage assets, landmarks or other attractions 
where views of the surroundings are an important part of the 
experience;  
• Communities where views contribute to the landscape setting 
enjoyed by residents; and 
• Travellers on scenic routes.

walking on streets or local public rights of way, with moderate 
interest in their visual environment. 
Low 
• People engaged in outdoor sport or recreation, which does 
not involve appreciation of, or focus upon, views; 
• People at their place of work, where the landscape setting is 
not important to the quality of working life; and  
• Travellers, where the view is fleeting and incidental to the 
journey. 
11.2.38 The magnitude of a visual effect has been assessed in terms of its size or 
scale, the geographical extent of the area influenced and its duration and 
degree of reversibility.  
11.2.39 The size or scale of change in the view relates to the degree of contrast to, or 
integration with, the visual composition, which is likely to result from the 
Project; and is influenced by the relative time over which a view is 
experienced and whether it is a full, partial or glimpsed view. 
11.2.40 The following criteria will be used to assess the magnitude of visual impacts, 
based on the degree of change to the view or composition as set out below in 
Table 11.7: 
Table 11.7: Visual Effects: magnitude of Impact 
Category 
Criteria 
Major adverse or 
beneficial visual 
effect  
The proposals will cause a dominant or complete change 
or contrast to the view, resulting from the loss or addition 
of features in the view and will substantially alter (degrade 
or enhance) the appreciation or composition of the view. 
Moderate adverse 
or beneficial visual 
effect 
The proposals will cause a clearly noticeable change or 
contrast to the view, which would have some effect on the 
composition, resulting from the loss or addition of features 
in the view and will noticeably alter (degrade or enhance) 
the appreciation of the view.

The proposals will cause a barely perceptible change or 
contrast to the view, which would not affect the 
composition or the appreciation of the view. 
No change 
The proposals will maintain the existing view and cause 
no change to the view. 
Neutral 
There will be a change to the composition of the view, but 
the change will be entirely in keeping with the existing 
elements of the view and maintain the composition of the

The landscape and visual 
cumulative impacts 
assessment should include 
not just other proposed 
large industrial 
developments in the area, 
but also other types of 
development that could 
contribute to a cumulative 
effect. The SoS 
recommends that the wind 
turbine in the Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park is 
included in the assessment 
of potential cumulative 
effects of this proposed 
development, and that 
consideration should be 
given to the potential for a 
further turbine at Stewartby 
landfill site.  
Noted. Cumulative 
impacts will be fully 
described in the ES 
and a preliminary 
assessment is included 
in this PEIR. The 
proposed turbine at 
Stewartby will be 
considered. As the 
turbine at the Marston 
Vale Millennium 
Country Park is already

We are aware of the 
ambition for the Forest of 
Marston Vale which is close 
to this therefore we hope 
that the developers will seek 
to avoid any deforestation. 
Should this be a 
requirement we would like to 
see compensatory new 
plantings in the ratio of at 
least 4:1 i.e. four trees 
planted to one removed, this 
precedent having been set 
in other planning 
No deforestation is 
proposed as part of the 
development of the 
Project.

May be useful to have views 
from Warden Hills in Luton 
and from the A6 across 
Barton Le Clay. 
 It is considered that 
these views would not 
have any sight of the 
Project given their 
significant distance 
away (approximately 
17 km south of the 
Project Site). 
Preliminary analysis of 
the ZTV has shown 
that there will be no 
views of the Project 
from this location.  
11.3 Embedded Mitigation 
11.3.1 In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on landscape 
and visual amenity as a result of the construction, decommissioning and 
operation of the Project, it has been assumed that certain elements of 
‘embedded mitigation’ will be applied. These mitigation items can often be 
considered as standard, best practice working methods, without which the 
Project would not be allowed to be developed. In terms of landscape and 
visual amenity, these standard mitigation measures include the fact that the 
Applicant is working with an architecture firm in order to ensure that there is 
inherent good design incorporated into the Project.  This will ensure that the 
Project, and in particular the Generating Equipment is sited appropriately and 
blends in as much as possible with its surroundings.  
11.3.2 During construction, it is likely that hoardings would be erected around the 
area of construction works, for reasons of creating a visual barrier to 
construction activities and also as a safety measure, to prevent access to the 
general public.  
11.3.3 The typical design of the AGI would incorporate screen planting on all sides, 
so as to limit any landscape or visual impacts.

11.4 Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
11.4.1 The Power Generation Plant Site is located within Rookery South Pit.  At the 
baseline, Rookery South Pit will be restored to low grade agricultural land 
with stabilised and re-profiled pit sides pursuant to the LLRS, as described in 
sections 2.6.2 and 4.7 of the PEIR. 
11.4.2 The history of extensive clay extraction and brick making is evident in the 
large flooded pits, revegetated spoil heaps, the four chimneys approximately 
70 m tall and associated buildings of the former Stewartby brickworks and the 
model village of Stewartby, built in the 1920s for the workers of The London 
Brick Company.   
11.4.3 Rookery North Pit, to the north of the Generating Equipment Site is occupied 
by a large lake. To the south, southeast and west, low ridges rise up to define 
the edge of Marston Vale whilst to the north the floor of the vale continues to 
the edge of Bedford.  
11.4.4 Although there are potential residential receptors within 1 km of the Project 
Site (e.g. South Pillinge Farm and Cottages, Manor Farm and Moreteyne 
House), the recent site visit has shown that it is unlikely that these properties  
have clear views of the stacks of the Generating Equipment owing to 
intervening vegetation and development. Should views be available of the 
overhead lines and towers of the Electrical Connection on higher ground to 
the south of the Project Site, they will be in the context of the existing power 
lines.  
11.4.5 The nearest property is South Pillinge Farm, approximately 150 m west of the 
Project Site boundary, although it is separated by at least two belts of mature 
vegetation.  Most settlements and outlying properties are also protected by 
screening vegetation and as the landform is generally level so the vegetation 
is more effective. 
11.4.6 Exceptions include some of the properties on higher ground such as Ampthill 
Park House, where there are wide, occasionally oblique views towards the 
Power Generation Site and the Electrical Connection. 
11.4.7 Recreational receptors include users of:  
� 
Open spaces such as the Millennium Park, Ampthill Park and Folly Wood 
near Lidlington; 
� 
Cycleways across the vale; 
� 
Footpaths and other public rights of way across the vale and the 
surrounding ridges; and 
� 
Heritage assets such as Houghton House and Ampthill Park.

11.4.8 Potential landscape and visual effects arising from the Power Generation 
Plant are those upon: 
� 
Landscape features of the Power Generation Plant Site after 
implementation of the LLRS; 
� 
Landscape character; and 
� 
Views and visual amenity. 
Landscape Character 
11.4.9 Relevant published landscape character descriptions for the Power 
Generation Plant Site are:

England, 2014b); and  
� 
6B: Mid Greensand Ridge, Mid Bedfordshire Landscape Character 
Assessment (Land Use Consultants, 2007).  
11.4.11 The Forest of Marston Vale: Forest Plan (The Forest of Marston Vale, 2000) 
also provides a landscape assessment for the forest area. The Brickfields 
landscape zone is also of relevance to the Power Generation Plant Site.

Construction/Decommissioning 
11.4.15 The main works associated with the construction / decommissioning phases 
of the Power Generation Plant would be excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations and, potential piling (if required) and craning the Gas Turbine 
Generator units into position. Potential adverse temporary landscape and 
visual effects have the potential to arise from the following activities during 
construction and decommissioning: 
� 
Site clearance, removal of vegetation and topsoil stripping from the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
� 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
� 
Construction of an internal road for access to the buildings and Laydown 
Area; 
� 
Movement of traffic including delivery and removal of materials to and from 
the Project Site, off-site road traffic including workers travelling to and from 
Project Site; 
� 
General construction / decommissioning activities including the movement 
of large scale construction equipment, i.e. tower cranes, smaller cranes, 
batching plants drilling rigs etc; site compounds.  Temporary buildings 
required for construction and parking on site materials stockpiles; 
presence of temporary hoardings and protective fencing; temporary 
hoardings and protective fencing; and signage; and  
� 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months 
11.4.16 Despite this, the construction phase is of a limited duration (22 months) and 
the potential impacts listed above will not all occur simultaneously. 
Furthermore, the majority of works will take place within Rookery South Pit 
and will therefore be below ground level, so will have limited potential of 
having visual impacts on receptors listed in Table 11.11. In terms of 
landscape effects, these are also limited, due to the fact that Rookery South 
Pit is a previously excavated bare earth pit, with limited landscape features.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
208 
11.4.17 In terms of the Access Road, construction will involve lower vehicles (e.g. 
tipper trucks rather than cranes) and the work will be undertaken on the route 
of the existing access track. There may be a requirement for small amounts of 
vegetation removal, but no landscape or visual effects are anticipated as a 
result of construction of the Access Road.  
11.4.18 Table 11.13 below summarises the preliminary assessment of landscape and 
visual effects arising from the Power Generation Plant during construction 
and decommissioning.

Operation 
11.4.19 The key potential visual effects arising from the Power Generation Plant will 
be during the operational phase and will be in relation to the Generating 
Equipment and associated 40 m high stacks. Although the Power Generation 
Plant Site is already well screened by the virtue that it is mainly within the 
Rookery South Pit (which is approximately 15 m bgl), and by surrounding 
vegetation, the stacks are still likely to be visible from certain locations in and 
around the Project Site (e.g. viewpoint 14) as well as from further afield.  
11.4.20 Due to the local topography in the area, views are likely to be mainly limited 
to the south and south east of the Project Site, along higher ground, 
particularly around the Greensands Ridge or from the footpath in close 
proximity to Gas Connection Option 1 (viewpoint 14). 
11.4.21 In the majority however, views of the Power Generation Plant Site will be 
seen in the context of the existing wind turbine at the Millennium Country 
Park, existing railways with gantries and embankments, the large pylons 
associated with the existing 400 kV Sundon to Grendon line and the four 
remaining chimneys at the former brickworks at Stewartby. The Power 
Generation Plant Site is also very well screened by intermediate hedges and 
belts of woodland.   
11.4.22 Table 11.14  below summarises the preliminary assessment of landscape and 
visual effects arising from the Power Generation Plant during operation.

11.5 Gas Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
11.5.1 The area proposed to site the Gas Connection (options 1 and 2) is 
characterised by gently rolling large, open arable fields, with hedge 
boundaries and belts of relatively recent plantations.  The fields are crossed 
by existing electricity pylons.  The Midland Mainline and Marston Vale Lines 
form strong linear boundaries to the eastern and western edges of The 
Rookery.  There is also a newly erected wind turbine to the west within the 
Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, which is 85m to the hub and 125m to 
the blade tip.  
11.5.2 The main visual receptors are likely to be users of footpaths and roads in 
close proximity to the AGI.  
Construction/Decommissioning 
11.5.3 Construction of the Gas Connection and particularly the AGI would have 
similar impacts to those described above for the Power Generation Plant, 
although they would be of a more limited extent. They are summarised below 
in Table 11.15.

11.5.4 During operation, the majority of the Gas Connection (the pipeline) will be 
buried underground, and covered with re-instated topsoil. The AGI at the NTS 
would be a relatively modest structure in comparison to the Generating 
Equipment. The typical design of the AGI would incorporate screen planting 
on all sides, so as to limit any landscape or visual impacts. Given the 
significant distance of the AGI from residential properties, there are not 
considered to be any impacts arising from visual amenity as a result of 
operation of the Gas Connection.  
11.5.5 In sensitive landscapes the construction of an underground pipeline can have 
effects on landscape features such as hedges, trees and leave crop marks in 
fields. Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 and 2 may have some minor

effects on the landscape where they crosses hedge boundaries, but these 
crossings will be replanted and will not give rise to any significant effects.  
11.6 Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
11.6.1 The baseline landscape for the Electrical Connection is similar to that already 
described for the Gas Connection.  
11.6.2 The main visual receptors are likely to be residential properties to the west, 
including South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge Cottages.  
Construction/Decommissioning 
11.6.3 Construction of the Electrical Connection would have similar impacts to those 
described above for the Power Generation Plant, although they would be of a 
more limited extent, high vehicles including cranes are likely to be required for 
erecting the new towers. They are summarised below in Table 11.16.

Operation 
11.6.4 During operation of the Electrical Connection, the main potential landscape 
and visual impacts will be the introduction of up to seven new towers (one of 
which will be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net additional 
towers) and a and up to two double circuit overhead lines to the landscape.  
11.6.5 A new substation will also be built as part of the Electrical Connection, within 
Rookery South Pit and adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. However, 
the impacts from this are likely to be less than the overhead lines and towers 
due to siting the substation in this location.  
11.6.6 The Electrical Connection is likely to be visible from locations in and around 
the Project Site as well as from further afield.  
11.6.7 Due to the local topography in the area, views are likely to be mainly limited 
to the south and south east, along higher ground, particularly around the 
Greensands Ridge or within the Project Site.  
11.6.8 In the majority however, views of the Electrical Connection will be seen in the 
context of the existing wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park, existing 
railways with gantries and embankments, the large pylons associated with the 
existing 400 kV Sundon to Grendon line and the four remaining chimneys at 
the former brickworks at Stewartby. The substation would also be very well 
screened by intermediate hedges and belts of woodland.   
11.6.9 Table 11.17 below summarises the preliminary assessment of landscape and 
visual effects arising from the Electrical Connection during operation.

11.7 Project as a Whole  
11.7.1 The Summary of Effects Table (11.18) below includes a section on the effects 
of the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection).  
11.7.2 In isolation, from certain views, there is the potential that the Power 
Generation Plant and Electrical Connection could both give rise to moderately 
significant impacts, as well as in combination.  
11.8 Cumulative Impacts 
Construction/Decommissioning 
11.8.1 Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
assessment has shown in the majority of cases that there will be no 
significant effects on landscape or visual amenity arising from the Project 
during construction or decommissioning.  However, there is the potential for 
significant impacts to occur from views to the south, particularly footpath 14. 
Should construction of other developments occur simultaneously, then a 
significant cumulative effect may arise. However, work is ongoing to 
determine effective mitigation to limit these effects. Furthermore, other 
developments would also be required to mitigate any construction effects 
through e.g. screen planting or use of hoardings.  
Operation 
11.8.2 During operation, there is the potential for cumulative effects to arise from the 
Project together with other planned developments. The most significant of 
these other planned developments from a landscape and visual impacts 
perspective are anticipated to be from large scale industrial or power 
developments such as the Covanta Rookery RRF, the integrated waste 
management operations planned for the Rookery South Pit and the 
Brogborough Wind Energy Project.  
11.8.3 Whilst work is ongoing as to the cumulative impacts assessment with these 
other developments, a preliminary assessment has been undertaken which 
has concluded the following: 
� 
Not enough details are available at this time to make an assessment of 
cumulative impacts with the integrated waste management operations 
proposed for the Rookery South Pit. The scheme is a high level outline 
concept only at this stage.  
� 
The Brogborough Wind Energy Project is approximately 4.5 km from the 
Project Site and the Project and the Brogborough Wind Energy Project 
would not be seen in views together apart from when viewed from a 
significant distance away. Therefore no significant cumulative effects are 
anticipated.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
221 
� 
It is recognised that the addition of the Project and the Covanta RRF 
within close proximity would have the potential to cause cumulative 
effects, particularly for visual receptors to the south of the Project Site. 
Although the two projects would be viewed in the context of other 
industrial development and would look to be complimentary to each other 
in terms of layout and design. Although there is the potential for a 
Significant effect cumulatively, it is anticipated that based on the 
preliminary assessment, the Project would add little to the much larger 
Covanta RRF project. Work is also ongoing to determine any suitable 
mitigation measures which would limit these impacts, such as effective 
screen planting.  
11.9 Summary and Conclusions 
11.9.1 There is the potential that from certain views, the Power Generation Plant and 
Electrical Connection could give rise to significant effects. However, there is 
the potential for further mitigation by using careful screen planting to reduce 
these effects. Further work will focus on taking worst case photomontages 
from key viewpoints, during the winter when the screening effects of 
vegetation are at their most limited.

visual effects.

12 Traffic and Transport 
12.1 Introduction 
12.1.1 This section sets out the preliminary findings of the assessment of the likely 
significant transport-related effects arising from the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Project.   
12.2 Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
12.2.1 Relevant policy and guidance in relation to traffic and transport is set out in 
Appendix 2.12. 
Assessment Methodology 
Study Area 
12.2.2 The study area for this assessment has been defined by the extent of the 
Project Site, as well as the main access routes which will be used by the 
Project during construction, operation and decommissioning, as outlined in 
Section 2 of this PEIR.  
12.2.3 A full Transport Assessment will be completed in accordance with the 
relevant policy and guidance in Appendix 2.12 and presented in the ES. The 
Applicant has held initial consultations with the relevant highway authorities in 
order to agree the scope and methodology of the Transport Assessment and 
the preliminary findings of the Transport Assessment are presented in this 
Section of the PEIR.  
12.2.4 The Transport Assessment will be supplemented by a Travel Plan which will 
set out a plan for reducing construction and operational traffic movements to 
the Project site. The Travel Plan will be included as an Appendix to the ES. 
Environmental Effects 
12.2.5 The transport-related environmental effects of the Project have been 
assessed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Environmental 
Assessment of Road Traffic published by IEMA in 1993 (the "IEMA 
Guidance"), and Volume 11 of the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges 
(DMRB) – Environmental Assessment. 
12.2.6 Reflecting this guidance, the assessment includes a review of: 
� 
severance; 
� 
driver delay; 
� 
pedestrian delay (also considering cyclist delay); 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
224 
� 
pedestrian amenity  (also considering cyclist amenity); 
� 
fear and intimidation; 
� 
accidents and safety; and 
� 
hazardous loads. 
12.2.7 Full definitions of these potential effects are set out in the IEMA Guidance.  
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
12.2.8 In respect of traffic and transport, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of 
the PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 
40 m high stack. 
12.2.9 The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to traffic, 
transport and access impacts is that the more gas turbine generator units 
required, the more deliveries are required during construction. Five is the 
maximum number of units being considered for this Project. More units will 
also generate the most vehicle movements during operation for maintenance 
visits etc.  
12.2.10 A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case scenario for the 
Electrical Connection of a double circuit overhead line and seven new towers 
(one of which will be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net 
additional towers) has been assessed.  
12.2.11 For the purposes of this assessment, it has been assumed that the number of 
decommissioning movements would reflect the construction movements. 
12.2.12 For the purposes of providing a worst case assessment, it is assumed that all 
movements would be made by car. 
Significance Criteria 
12.2.13 The significance criteria derived for this assessment reflects that contained 
within the guidance documents referred to in Appendix 2.12.Together with 
professional judgement.  
12.2.14 The effect of significance is derived from a combination of the sensitivity (or 
importance) of the receptors affected and magnitude (or scale) of the change 
on the receptors.  Categories of sensitivity and magnitude are defined and 
assessed to determine the significance of effect. 
12.2.15 For the transport-related effects considered in this section of the PEIR, 
categories of receptor sensitivity have been defined from the principles set 
out in the IEMA Guidelines and therefore differ slightly from the example 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
225 
sensitivity of receptors table set out in Table 4.1. They are set out below in 
Table 12.1: 
Table 12.1 – Sensitivity of Receptors 
Sensitivity

Schools, colleges and other 
educational institutions;

parks and recreation areas; 
shopping areas; and 
roads used by pedestrians with narrow 
footways 
Low 
open space;

churches. 
12.2.16 In addition, although not specifically identified within the IEMA Guidelines as 
being sensitive, it has been assumed that residential areas and employment 
areas have low sensitivity to these effects as they typically experience regular 
traffic movements. 
12.2.17 The magnitude of effect depends upon the category of traffic effects being 
assessed, and this has been based on the guidance relating to severance (as 
set out below) which suggests that 0%, 30%, 60% and 90% changes in traffic 
levels should be considered as “negligible”, “minor”, “moderate” and “major” 
impacts respectively.   
12.2.18 IEMA’s Guidelines set out the broad principles of how to assess the 
magnitude of effect for each category of potential environmental impact.  This 
is summarised below: 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
226 
� 
Severance – The guidance states that “severance is the perceived 
division that can occur within a community when it becomes separated by 
a major traffic artery.”  Further, “Changes in traffic flow of 30%, 60% and 
90% are regarded as producing ‘slight’, ‘moderate’ and ‘substantial’ 
changes in severance respectively” (to maintain consistency with this 
assessment, these are referred to as “Minor”, “Moderate“ and “Major”).  
However, the guidance acknowledges that the measurement and 
prediction of severance is extremely difficult.  The assessment of 
severance pays full regard to specific local conditions, in particular the 
location of pedestrian routes to key local facilities and whether or not 
crossing facilities are provided. 
Volume 11, Section 3, Part 8, Chapter 6 of the Design Manual for Roads 
and Bridges dated 2006 (the "DMRB Manual") provides further guidance 
on this aspect of Severance in terms of the 2-way Annual Average Daily 
Traffic Flow (AADT) on a link. It states that new severance should be 
described in terms of “Slight”, Moderate” or Severe” (to maintain 
consistency with this assessment, these are referred to as “Minor”, 
“Moderate“ and “Major”) and that these categories  ” … should be coupled 
with an estimate of the numbers of people affected, their location and the 
community facilities from which they are severed.”  (The potential effects 
as set out later in this section are based in an assessment which takes this 
into account).   Table 12.2 summarises these thresholds: 
Table 12.2 – Pedestrian Severance Threshold (DMRB) 
Severance Level 
Traffic Flow (AADT) 
Major 
>  16,000 
Moderate  
8,000  -  16,000 
Minor 
>   8,000 
� 
Driver delay – such delays “…are only likely to be significant when the 
traffic on the network surrounding the proposed development is already at, 
or close to, the capacity of the system”; 
� 
Pedestrian delay – “Changes in the volume, composition or speed of 
traffic may affect the ability of people to cross roads.”  The guidance 
suggests that assessors “… use their judgement to determine whether 
pedestrian delay is a significant impact”.  For the purposes of this 
assessment, the pedestrian severance threshold levels identified in Table 
12.2 above have been applied to pedestrian delay; 
� 
Pedestrian amenity – this is broadly defined as the relative pleasantness 
of a journey, whether a journey is affected by traffic flow, traffic 
composition and pavement width / separation from traffic.  The guidance 
suggests a tentative threshold for judging the significance of changes in 
pedestrian amenity of where traffic flow (or its lorry component) is halved 
or doubled; 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
227 
� 
Fear and intimidation – the impact of this is dependent upon the volume 
of traffic, its heavy vehicle composition, its proximity to people or the lack 
of protection caused by such factors as narrow pavement widths.  The 
guidance states that there are no commonly agreed thresholds for 
estimating this from known traffic and physical conditions, but it does 
nevertheless suggest some thresholds which could be used, based on 
previous research, and these are shown in Table 12.3:

Negligible 
   <   600 
   <   1,000 
    <   10 
� 
Accidents and safety – the guidance suggests that “Professional 
judgement will be needed to assess the implications of local 
circumstances, or factors, which may elevate or lessen risks of accidents, 
e.g. junction conflicts”. 
� 
Hazardous loads – the guidance states that the Environmental 
Assessment needs clearly to outline the estimated number and 
composition of such loads, but that the analysis should reflect the nature 
of the load in question. The IEMA guidelines acknowledge that most 
developments will not result in increases in the number of movements or 
hazardous / dangerous loads. 
12.2.19 The sensitivity of the receptor and the magnitude of impact are combined to 
give the overall significance of effect, as set out in Table 4.3 of this PEIR 
Table 12.4 sets out the significance criteria which have been used, at this 
preliminary stage in the assessment, to describe likely significant transport 
effects. The criteria are based on guidance referred to above together with 
professional judgement.

The SoS considers that 
information regarding site 
access routes for construction 
traffic and any vehicles carrying 
abnormal indivisible loads (AIL) 
should be clearly identified and 
assessed within the ES; 
including any alterations 
required to the existing road 
network to accommodate any 
AIL. The ES should also 
identify whether any alterations 
to the existing road network 
would be retained or reinstated, 
and assess the potential effects 
arising.

12.3 Embedded Mitigation Measures 
12.3.1 In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on traffic and 
transport as a result of the construction, decommissioning and operation of 
the Project, it has been assumed that certain elements of ‘embedded 
mitigation’ will be applied. These mitigation items can often be considered as 
standard, best practice working methods, without which the Project would not 
be allowed to be developed. In terms of traffic and transport, these standard 
mitigation measures include:  
� 
Ensuring traffic movements are timed to avoid peak periods; and  
� 
Adherence to a CEMP which would limit impacts from construction traffic 
movements.

12.4 Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
12.4.1 Operational access to the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed from the 
north near Stewartby via Green Lane as shown on Figure 12.2. Green Lane 
links to Bedford Road and the A421 to the west, and Stewartby Way and the 
B530 to the east. There is a junction on Green Lane leading to an existing 
access track on the previously unexcavated land on the western side of 
Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery South Pit.  
12.4.2 A new purpose built Access Road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site. 
The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery 
South Pit the Access Road would use the access ramp (being constructed as 
part of the LLRS) to enter into the pit and cross through the base of the pit 
until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site along the alignment shown on 
Figure 12.2. It is proposed that the 1.7 km long Access Road would be 
bitumen construction formed with kerbs, and would be approximately 6 m 
wide allowing for two-way traffic.  
Local and Strategic Highway Network 
12.4.3 The road network in the vicinity of the Project Site is shown on Figures 12.1 
and 12.2. 
12.4.4 Green Lane is a rural single carriageway road, connecting Stewartby to 
Marston Moretaine on Bedford Road, the old A421, at a ghost island priority 
junction 1.3 km to the north-west. The Green Lane carriageway is around 6.5 
m, with no lighting or footway to the north-west of the STEM College. The 
road is subject to the national speed limit of 60 mph from Bedford Road to 
100 m west of the Access Road, where a 30 mph speed limit is applied. 
12.4.5 To the east of the Power Generation Plant Site, the road is around 6.5 m to 
7.0 m wide, with a footway in the northern verge. This is present all the way 
into Stewartby. A speed limit of 30 mph is applied on this stretch of road. 
Green Lane continues to the east forming Stewartby Way, before connecting 
with the B530.   
12.4.6 Bedford Road, with which Green Lane connects, formed the A421 before the 
parallel dual carriageway scheme opened in 2010 between the M1 Junction 
13 and Bedford. Access to the new A421 is provided at a series of grade-
separated junctions, the closest to the Power Generation Plant Site being 3.2 
km north of the Green Lane junction, and 2 km south of the Green Lane 
junction.  
12.4.7 The A421 is aligned on a south-west to north-east axis, connecting to M1 
Junction 13 - around 8 km south-west of Green Lane – passing to the south 
of Bedford city centre, to end at the A1, 26 km to the north-east of Green 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
235 
Lane. Access is provided to Bedford by a series of five grade separated 
junctions on the A421. 
12.4.8 The M1, located 8 km to the south-west of the Green Lane junction, forms 
one of the main strategic north-south highway routes through Great Britain, 
connecting some of the major conurbations of the north (Sheffield, Leeds), 
the Midlands (Nottingham, Northampton), Milton Keynes and London. A 
connection from the M1 to the M6 provides a link to Scotland, the major 
conurbations in the north-west (Liverpool, Manchester), and Birmingham.     
Public Rights of Way 
 
12.4.9 There are no Public Rights of Way within the Power Generation Plant Site. 
Footpaths within close proximity to the Power Generation Plant Site, and with 
specific relevance to the Power Generation Plant are shown in Appendix 
12.1, and are as follows: 
� 
To the north-west of the Power Generation Plant Site FP72 provides a 
leisure footpath around the Stewartby Lake. In order to form an access 
between Stewartby and FP72, there is a footpath link to Green Lane 160 
m west of the railway crossing.  
� 
To the west of Stewartby Lake, there is a footpath link to Bedford Road, 
via FP19. This joins Bedford Road within a national speed limit zone, 
where no footway is present. The speed limit is reduced to 30 mph 90 m 
south of the FP19 link: after a further 40 m into this zone, a footway is 
formed.  
Footways and Cycle ways 
 
12.4.10 On a section of Green Lane within Stewartby, there is a footway in the 
northern verge of the road, with a width varying around 1.5 m.  The footway in 
this section is illuminated by the street lighting system. Green Lane in this 
section is subject to a speed limit of 30 mph 
12.4.11 The footway on Green Lane continues north-west for a further 50 m after the 
railway crossing. This section of road is subject to the national speed limit, 
which applies 20 m after the railway crossing. To enhance the pedestrian 
connectivity to the STEM College located to the north of Green Lane, this 
footway is to be continued along Green Lane to the college by the STEM 
College promoter – as well as the students walking to this facility, this would 
accommodate any pedestrian walking from Stewartby along Green Lane 
continuing to the Stewartby Lake FP72 footpath. A school crossing patrol will 
be provided around the school opening hours to assist the movements of 
students from this footpath. 
12.4.12 There are no further pedestrian facilities along Green Lane to the north past 
this point.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
236 
12.4.13 On Bedford Road, a footway starts 160 m south of the Green Lane Junction, 
with a width between 1.5 m and 2 m. This section is illuminated by the street 
lighting system.  
12.4.14 No cycle ways are present on either Bedford Road, or Green Lane.  
Equestrian  
12.4.15 There are no bridleways or equestrian facilities on the Power Generation 
Plant Site.  
12.4.16 As shown on Appendix 12.1 of this PEIR, BW84 is the closest bridleway to 
the Power Generation Plant Site, approximately 200m east, joining FP17 and 
FP72, towards the south and south west of Stewartby Lake respectively.  
Existing Bus Routes and Services 
12.4.17 Existing bus services are summarised in Table 12.6 below  
Table 12.6 – Existing Bus Services 
 
12.4.18 As shown on Figure 12.1, the nearest bus stops to the Power Generation

Village Hall – approximately 350 m east of the existing Rookery Pit access on 
Green Lane. A further four stops are located within Stewartby further away.  
Existing Rail Routes and Services 
 
12.4.20 As shown on Figure 12.1, whilst the nearest rail station to the Power 
Generation Plant Site is the Millbrook Rail Station, approximately 700 m 
south-west from the centre of the Power Generation Plant Site, practically, the 
closest station is the Stewartby Rail Station to the northern side of Green 
Lane. This station is approximately 90 m from the Green Lane Site Access, 
and 1.7 km north-west from the centre of the Power Generation Plant Site.  
12.4.21 Both the Stewartby and Millbrook Rail Stations are served by the Marston 
Vale Line that provides an hourly service operated by London Midlands in 
each direction between Bedford and Bletchley from Mondays to Saturdays 
(16 trains per day in each direction).  
12.4.22 There are links from Millbrook and Stewartby Rail Stations to Bedford, 
Bedford St Johns, Kempston Hardwick, Lidlington, Ridgmont, Aspley Guise, 
Woburn Sands, Bow Brickhill, Fenny Stratford and Bletchley.  
12.4.23 The Midland Main Line runs to the east of the Project Site providing services 
from Bedford to London St Pancras, the Midlands and northern England.  The 
nearest railway station to the Project Site served by the Midland Main Line is 
the Bedford Railway Station, served by the adjacent Marston Vale Line, 
located approximately 9.3 km north-east from the centre of the Project Site. 
The Bedford Rail Station is served by East Midlands Trains, London Midlands 
and First Capital Connect, providing direct rail connections to northwards - to 
Wellingborough, Kettering, Market Harborough, Leicester, Loughborough and 
Nottingham - and southwards to Luton, St Albans City and London St 
Pancras.  
12.4.24 There are proposals in the future to reconnect the Bedford Railway Station 
between Oxford and Cambridge through the East West Rail Link project. This 
is being promoted by the East-West Rail Consortium, a consortium of local 
authorities and interested bodies along the route. The western section of the 
East West Rail Link project from Oxford to Bedford was approved by the 
Government in November 2011 (committing £270 million to the scheme), with 
completion expected in 2019. 
Road Safety 
12.4.25 Personal Injury Collision ((PIC) - formerly known as Personal Injury Accident 
– (PIA)) summary data was obtained from Bedfordshire Highways for the 
period covering the 1st July 2009 to 31st March 2014. 
12.4.26 The Transport Assessment will provide a detailed summary of the PICs 
(location and nature) for links and junctions in the study area, and would 
provide an estimate of the likely anticipated number of PICs for similar types 
of links and junctions using national data, to enable comparison. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
238 
12.4.27 An initial assessment has identified that for all the links and junctions close to 
the Power Generation Plant Site, the number of observed PICs is low, likely 
to be less than that which would be expected based on the highway layout 
and traffic flows.  No trends appear to be apparent within the PICs data, nor 
any indication that there are trends relating to vulnerable users. 
12.4.28 As such, there appears to be no existing road safety issues in relation to the 
road links and junctions close to the Power Generation Plant Site. 
Baseline Survey Information 
12.4.29 Details of the traffic counts data for the Old A421 taken covering the period 
10th May to 16th May 2012 have been obtained from Highways Agency, 
these have been reviewed and summarised in Table 12.5 below. It is noted 
here that updated data will be collected and analysed as part of the EIA.

12.4.30 A Pedestrian / Cyclist survey was undertaken to support the Covanta RRF 
Project. It was undertaken on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday in May 2010 - 
prior to the opening of the STEM College - and recorded the movements of all 
non-vehicular movements along Green Lane. This data is summarised below 
in Table 12.8.

12.4.31 No equestrian movements were recorded during the survey period. 
12.4.32 These weekday pedestrian and cyclist flows will increase as activity at the 
STEM College increases, the existing situation will be surveyed during the 
preparation of the assessment.     
Receptors 
12.4.33 It is concluded that the only receptor with a high sensitivity likely to be 
affected by the Power Generation Plant is the STEM Sixth Form College on 
Green Lane. However, whilst the STEM College, an educational 
establishment, is a high sensitivity receptor, as the students attending will be 
sixteen or older they will be more risk-aware than primary or secondary 
school children. 
12.4.34 Receptors with a medium sensitivity are considered to be: 
� 
The Water Sports Club on Green Lane, but located 300 m south of the 
road itself; 
� 
The narrow footway / cycleway across the level crossing; and 
� 
Cyclists on Green Lane. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
12.4.35 An assessment has been made of the likely average traffic that is likely to be 
generated by the construction of the Power Generation Plant from 
experience, and with reference to the traffic flows identified from similar 
projects. It is assumed that all these trips would all be made by car, assuming 
1.6 occupants per car, as per DfT guidance.  
12.4.36 For the purposes of this assessment, it has been assumed that the number of 
decommissioning movements would reflect the construction movements. 
12.4.37 In addition, a further assessment has been made of the likely peak 
Construction movements, which would typically occur over a very short 
timescale. For the purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that these 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
240 
would be generated by deliveries of ready mixed concrete for the main 
foundation construction. For the purposes of deriving a worst case 
assessment, it is assumed that this operation would have a total of 30 
operatives on site, receiving deliveries of concrete every 5 minutes through 
the day for ten hours – i.e., 120 HGV movements and 20 car movements. The 
number of days when the foundation construction operation is on-going at full 
capacity and generating these higher levels of flow are anticipated to be 
limited to one or two days in total across the whole project. 
12.4.38 The likely construction trip generation in relation to the construction and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant is summarised in Table 12.9: 
Table 12.9 – Average and Peak Construction movements (Total 2-way) 
12.4.39 For the purposes of this assessment, it has been assumed that the number of 
decommissioning movements would reflect the construction movements. 
12.4.40 With respect to the minimum environmental impact thresholds for Pedestrian 
Severance and Fear and Intimidation identified in section 12.2, the 
preliminary assessment has shown that all of these relatively limited 
construction movements – indeed, even the peak construction movement  - 
are considered to be not significant. 
12.4.41 Notwithstanding, to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles on 
Stewartby, the Applicant will seek to agree a contractor's Route Management 
Plan at the detailed design stage of the Project to ensure that all employees, 
but especially delivery contractors' vehicles travel to and from the Power 
Generation Plant Site only along Green Lane to the west towards Bedford 
Road and the old A421, on to the new A421 dual carriageway.  The only car-

12.4.42 It is proposed that the Route Management Plan could, for example,  include 
the following: 
� 
HGV traffic travelling to / from the south would route through the Bedford 
Road / Green Lane junction, then along the old A421 to the new grade-
separated Marston Moretaine Junction to access the new A421 dual 
carriageway towards the M1 Junction 13; and 
�

Operation 
12.4.44 During normal operation of the Power Generation Plant, up to four members 
of staff would be working at the Power Generation Plant Site at any one time. 
Three shifts per day are assumed, to provide 24 hour coverage. These shift 
changes would be timed to avoid the network peak hour, hence the highway 
impact would be minimised. For the purposes of providing a worst case 
assessment, it is assumed that all movements would be made by car. 
12.4.45 During the annual maintenance of the Generating Equipment, there may be 
up to 40 additional staff on site for a typical maintenance period of one month. 
It is assumed that all these trips would all be made by car, assuming 1.6 
occupants per car, as per DfT guidance. Reflecting the typical working hours 
on similar power station sites, it is assumed that majority of these movements 
would be made outside of the network peak – to provide a robust assessment 
it has been assumed that only 25 percent of the total vehicle movements 
would be during the peak hour. A further five HGV movements per day (none 
during the peak hour) are assumed during the maintenance. 
12.4.46 The likely operational trip generation in connection with the operation of the 
Power Generation Plant is summarised in Table 12.11 below. 
Table 12.11 – Operational movements (Total 2-way) 
 
12.4.47 With respect to the minimum thresholds identified in section 12.2, it is shown

12.5 Gas Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
12.5.1 As described on Sections 2.4, 4 and 5 of this PEIR, there are currently two 
potential Gas Connection Route Corridor Options under consideration.  These 
are Option 1 and Option 2 (as defined and more particularly described in 
Section 2.4 of Section 2 of this PEIR) ").  Until the preferred Option 1 is 
finalised following further consultation and studies, four options are being 
considered with regard to access for the Gas Connection. These three access 
options are shown on Figure 12.2, and are as follows:  
� 
from M1 Junction 13 via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, 
Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road;  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site; 
� 
from Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
and Millbrook Road, or;  
� 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road.  
12.5.2 It is anticipated that any operational access requirements would have minimal 
and ephemeral usage. Depending on the final location of the AGI, a 
permanent access may be created off either Houghton Lane (in the case of 
Option 1) or Millbrook Lane or the B530 (in the case of Option 2). It is 
assumed that the operational routes would be as were agreed for the 
construction phase.  
Local and Strategic Highway Network 
12.5.3 The road network in the vicinity of the Gas Connection Route Corridor 
Options, 1 and 2 is shown on Figures 12.1 and 12.2. In addition to the local 
and strategic highway network described for the Power Generation Plant are 
the following road links:- 
� 
Millbrook Road, which bisects the Gas Connection Route Corridor Options 
1 and 2 on a north-east – south-west axis, is a single carriageway with a 
speed limit of 60 mph. The width of the road ranges between 5 m to 5.5 m. 
To the south-west, Millbrook Road connects to Houghton Lane, then on to 
Sandhill Close.  
� 
Sandhill Close runs north-south, to the south of Gas Connection Route 
Corridoroption 1, connecting to the A507 via roundabout. Sandhill Close 
has a weight restriction of 7.5 tonnes and a width restriction of 6’ 6”, 
making it suitable only for cars and light vehicles. To the north-east, 
Millbrook Road links to the B530 at a priority junction.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
247 
� 
The B530 runs on a north to south axis, crossing the extreme east edge of 
Gas Connection Route Corridoroption 2, going from Bedford south 
towards Ampthill. The B530 is a single lane carriageway with a speed limit 
of 60 mph.  Stewartby Way also links to the B530, which in turn links to 
Green Lane through Stewartby. As there is a height restriction of 11’3” and 
a 7.5 tonne weight restriction through Stewartby, it is concluded that this 
route is only suitable for cars and light vehicles. 
� 
The A507 provides a single carriageway connection from the M1 Junction 
13 to Ampthill and passes to the south of Gas Connection Route 
Corridoroption 1.  
 
Existing Pedestrian, Cyclist and Equestrian Facilities 
 
12.5.4 The Public Rights of Way in the vicinity of the proposed Gas Connection 
Options are shown on the indicative plans included in Appendix 12.1. 
Public Rights of Way 
12.5.5 The southern part of Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 is bisected 
east-west by FP14, FP65 and FP15, connecting between Station Road to 
Millbrook Road, crossing under the Midland Main railway line by a culvert. 
The FP4 spur from FP15 is aligned north-south to the west of the rail line, 
crossing eastwards by a further culvert towards FP16. 
12.5.6 To the north-east of the proposed Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2, 
footpath FP3 is aligned north-south from Stewartby Way, from west of the 
junction with the B530. FP3 meets an intersection with FP10 and FP16, 
before travelling east to terminate at the B530. 
12.5.7 To the north-east of the Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2, FP10 links 
from FP3 to Millbrook Road. Meanwhile, FP16 travels west at the FP3 
intersection for a short distance before terminating.  
Footways and Cycle ways 
12.5.8 The footway links to the adjacent communities – Stewartby, Millbrook and 
Marston Moretaine – are limited, and are not continuous.  
12.5.9 From Stewartby, whilst there is a footpath along Stewartby Way along the 
westbound carriageway, there are no footways on the B530, Millbrook Road 
or Houghton Lane. 
12.5.10 From Millbrook, to the east of the Sandhill Close / Station Lane Junction, 
there is a footway along Sandhill Close in the southern verge of the 
carriageway up until its junction with Houghton Lane and Russell Grove 
where it ends. To the west of the Sandhill Close / Station Lane Junction, there 
are no footways along this derestricted section of Station Lane up until the 
Millbrook Rail Station. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
248 
12.5.11 From Marston Moretaine, there are footways along Beancroft Road and 
Station Road, then along Station Lane where it terminates at the Millbrook 
Rail Station. There is no footway along the section of Station Lane from the 
Millbrook Rail Station to Sandhill Close in Millbrook. 
12.5.12 No cycle ways are present in the vicinity of either Gas Connection Route 
Corridoroption.   
Equestrian 
12.5.13 There are no bridleways in the area of either of the proposed Gas Connection 
Route Corridor Options. 
Existing Bus Routes and Services 
 
12.5.14 The Gas Connection Options are served by one regular bus service, 42 which 
runs along the B530 to the east of the Project Site, and provides 24 services 
in both directions between Bedford bus station and Flitwick. As shown on 
Figure 12.1, the nearest bus stop is located to the east of the Gas Connection 
Route Corridoroption 2 at the B530 Ampthill Road / Millbrook Road Junction. 
12.5.15 The area is also served by four other irregular bus services, C2, FL2, FL5 and 
FL6B, which run along Millbrook Road and the B530. 
12.5.16 The services are summarised in Table 12.13.

Existing Rail Routes and Services 
 
12.5.17 As shown on Figure 12.1, Millbrook Rail Station is located 1 km to the west of 
the preferred Option 1.This station is served by the Marston Vale Line 
services reported in section 12.4.  
Receptors 
 
12.5.18 Receptors with a high sensitivity potentially affected by the Gas Connection 
Options are: 
� 
Pedestrians and cyclists due to the lack of footways on the B530; and  
� 
Pedestrians and cyclists due to the lack of footways on Millbrook Road. 
12.5.19 Whilst these receptors are of a high sensitivity, the numbers of pedestrians 
and cyclists are considered to be minimal.  
12.5.20 The other receptor, with a medium sensitivity, would be the cyclists on the 
B530 and Millbrook Road – albeit the numbers of cyclists are also considered 
to be minimal. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
12.5.21 An assessment has been made of the likely traffic generated by the 
construction of the Gas connection Options. It is assumed that all trips made 
by car would have 1.6 occupants per car, as per DfT guidance.  
12.5.22 The likely construction trip generation in relation to the construction and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection Options is summarised in Table 
12.14 and applies for either Route Corridoroption.

12.5.23 With respect to the minimum vehicle increase thresholds identified in section 
12.2, all of these construction movements are so low that any impact would 
be considered to be not significant. 
12.5.24 Notwithstanding, and to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles on 
surrounding settlements, the Applicant will commit to the implementation of a 
contractor's Route Management Plan.

Operation 
12.5.26 There would be a minimal number of movements to the Gas Connection 
Options during the Operational phase (less than 1 per week) of the Gas 
Connection Options.  These movements would be intermittent, and would be 
limited to routine inspection and maintenance operations at the AGI.  
12.5.27 As such, this has therefore been scoped out from further assessment and no 
assessment has been undertaken of these movements.  
12.6 Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
12.6.1 Several access route options are still being considered with regard to 
accessing the Electrical Connection. They are shown on Figure 12.2, and are 
as follows:  
� 
From Junction 13 of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close and Station 
Lane;  
� 
From Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road, 
Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and Station Lane;  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
252 
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant Site; or 
� 
From the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7 km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane and 
Station Lane.  
12.6.2 It is considered that any operational access requirements would have minimal 
and ephemeral usage. It is assumed that the operational routes would be the 
same as those for the construction phase of the Electrical Connection 
Existing Pedestrian, Cyclist and Equestrian Facilities 
 
12.6.3 The Public Rights of Way in the vicinity of the proposed Electrical Connection 
are shown on the indicative plans in Appendix 12.1 of this PEIR. 
12.6.4 In addition to the Public Rights of Way detailed for the Power Generation 
Plant and the Gas Connection, the area proposed for siting the Electrical 
Connection is bisected by several footpath routes: 
� 
Footpath FP7 is aligned from north-west to south-east through the 
Electrical Connection Area, connecting between Millbrook Road and 
Station Lane;  
� 
the same Footpath FP14 – FP65 – FP15 referred to in section 12.4 also 
connects between Millbrook Road and Station Lane; and 
� 
Footpath FP6 runs north-south from the FP7 link to Sandhill Close to the 
south of the site.  
Existing Bus Routes and Services 
12.6.5 In addition to the Bus Services detailed for the Power Generating Plant and 
the Gas Connection, there are three other irregular bus services (45, 49 and 
164) which run along Station Lane to the west of the Electrical Connection. 
Existing Rail Routes and Services 
12.6.6 As shown on Figure 12.1, Millbrook Rail Station is located 0.5 km to the west 
of the centre of the proposed Electrical Connection. This station is served by 
the Marston Vale Line services reported in section 12.3.  
Local and Strategic Highway Network 
12.6.7 Station Road / Station Lane runs from the junction of Houghton Lane / 
Sandhill Close junction to Marston Moretaine, crossing the Marston Valley 
Rail Line at a level crossing. It continues through Marston Moretaine to link 
towards the A421.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
253 
Receptors 
12.6.8 In addition to the receptors with a high sensitivity possibly affected by the 
Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection as referred to in sections 12.4 
and 12.5 above, there is also a lack of footways on Station Road / Station 
Lane.  Whilst this receptor may be considered to be a high sensitivity, the 
numbers of pedestrians and cyclists are minimal.  
12.6.9 Another receptor with a medium sensitivity includes the cyclists on Station 
Road – albeit these numbers are also considered to be minimal, given the 
survey data presented in Table 12.6. 
Construction/Decommissioning 
12.6.10 An assessment has been made of the likely traffic generated by the 
construction of the Electrical Connection. It is assumed that all trips made by 
car would have 1.6 occupants per car, as per DfT guidance.  
12.6.11 The 
likely 
construction 
trip 
generation 
for 
the 
construction 
and 
decommissioning of the Electrical Connection is summarised in Table 12.16 
below.

12.6.12 With respect to the minimum vehicle increase thresholds identified in Section 
12.2, all of these construction movements are so low that any impact would 
be considered to be not significant. 
12.6.13 Notwithstanding, to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles on 
surrounding settlements, the Applicant will commit to the implementation of a

Operational  
12.6.15 There would be a minimal number of movements to the Electrical Connection 
during the operational phase. These movements would be intermittent, and 
would be limited to routine inspection and maintenance operations.

12.6.16 As such, no assessment has been undertaken of these movements.  
12.7 Project as a Whole  
12.7.1 The Summary of Effects Table 12.18 below includes a section on the effects 
of the Project as a whole (i.e. the combined effects of the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection). 
12.7.2 No impacts are predicted on ecological receptors from any of the individual 
elements of the Project or from the Project as a whole.  
12.8 Cumulative Effects 
12.8.1 Construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, 
as shown in the preliminary traffic assessment in Sections 12.3 to 12.5 of this 
PEIR, the significance of effects of the Project is no more than negligible and 
is therefore not significant for the purposes of the EIA Regulations.  
Accordingly,, then given that traffic effects of the Project alone are no more 
than negligible, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or 
contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with 
other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is 
considered that no cumulative effects assessment is required.   
12.8.2 On carrying out the detailed traffic assessment during the EIA process, if the 
position in 12.6.1 is shown not to be the case, then the EIA will take into 
account other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site, and will include 
a cumulative impacts assessment in accordance with Section 4 of this PEIR.   
12.8.3 As set out above, although the impact of the Project in all of its stages is 
considered to be neutral, should a cumulative effects assessment of Project 
be required (pursuant to section 12.6.2 above) in relation to the road and 
highway network, it is proposed that reference is made to the A421 Traffic 
Model. This model was developed by Hyder Consulting Ltd to understand the 
strategic effect of the A421 dualling, and is jointly owned by the Highways 
Agency and CBC. The output from this model would be manually revised to 
respond to any of the emerging developments considered necessary by the 
joint authorities and considered within the model.

13 Archaeology and Cultural Heritage 
13.1 Introduction 
13.1.1 This section presents the preliminary findings of the heritage impact 
assessment for the Project. It presents a preliminary assessment of the 
potential for likely significant effects of the Project on cultural heritage assets. 
It describes the likely significant direct (physical) and indirect (visual) effects 
of the Project on heritage assets within the study area.  
13.2 Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
13.2.1 Relevant policy and guidance in relation to archaeology and cultural heritage 
is set out in Appendix 2-13. 
Assessment Methodology 
Study Areas 
13.2.2 The following study areas have been chosen for the heritage impact 
assessment based on professional judgment and experience of potential 
likely significant effects: 
� 
The inner study area - A radius of 1 km from the boundary of the Project 
Site which has been used for assessing direct (physical) effects on 
undesignated heritage assets.   
� 
The wider study area - A radius of 5 km from the boundary of the Project 
Site which has been used for assessing indirect (visual) effects on 
Scheduled Monuments, Grade I and Grade II* Listed Buildings, 
Conservation Areas and Registered Parks and Gardens.   
� 
A radius of 2 km from the boundary of the Project Site which has been 
used for assessing indirect (visual) effects on Grade II Listed Buildings.  
13.2.3 The significance of Grade II listed buildings generally resides within their 
architectural interest (i.e. their form and fabric) and the positive contribution of 
their settings to their significance is generally limited to their immediate 
vicinity.  These are almost all situated within the surrounding villages and in 
general have localised settings which do not have a strong interaction with 
the surrounding countryside. The extensive woodland present in all directions 
further serves to interrupt any views towards the Project Site. 
13.2.4 Beyond a distance of 2 km these factors are considered to reduce the 
potential for impact on the settings of listed buildings. For the purposes of this 
assessment consideration of Grade II listed buildings, where setting is 
generally a less sensitive part of their significance, has been limited to 2 km.  
Beyond this distance, given the nature of the surrounding landscape, it is not 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
263 
considered that the presence of the Project would affect the significance of 
these buildings. 
13.2.5 Therefore, only those Grade II listed buildings within 2 km have been 
considered in detail. The data for all Grade II listed buildings within 5 km has 
been collected, plotted and reviewed to identify any buildings of this grade 
beyond 2 km that are considered to have a highly sensitive setting.   
13.2.6 These study areas are shown on Figures 13.1 and 13.2.  
Methodology 
13.2.7 In order to provide an understanding of the baseline conditions of the Project 
Site and study areas, a desk study, site walkover and visits to selected 
designated assets have been undertaken, supplemented by consultations 
with interested parties, expert advice and professional judgment. 
13.2.8 In order to assess the indirect (visual) effects of the Project, ZTVs, together 
with fieldwork observations and professional judgement were used.   
13.2.9 In all cases, the various levels of predicted effects have been defined in 
accordance with the scales of change provided in Tables 13.1 - 13.3 below:   
13.2.10 The factors taken into account in assessing the extent of the setting of each 
heritage asset and whether, how and to what degree the setting makes a 
contribution to the significance of each heritage asset are taken from The 
Setting of Heritage Assets (English Heritage 2011b). 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
13.2.11 In respect of archaeology and cultural heritage, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed Project parameters (which are described in 
Sections 2 and 5 of the PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, 
each with their own 40 m high stack. 
13.2.12 The reason why this configuration has been chosen is that it represents the 
maximum number of stacks possible (e.g. 5) at their greatest height (40 m). 
This is therefore considered to represent the greatest potential visual impact 
on the setting of cultural heritage assets. The various scenarios have little 
difference in terms of ground take or impacts on buried heritage assets 
13.2.13 A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case scenario for the 
Electrical Connection of a double circuit overhead line and seven new towers 
(one of which will be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net 
additional towers) has been assessed.  
Significance Criteria 
13.2.14 The criteria employed for determining the sensitivity of a heritage asset, 
magnitude of impact and the significance of effects are set out below. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
264 
Sensitivity 
13.2.15 The sensitivity of each type of heritage asset and its setting is defined using 
the scales in Table 13.1.

Magnitude of impact 
13.2.16 The magnitude of impact is a measure of the degree to which the significance 
of a heritage asset will be increased or diminished by a proposed 
development. In determining the magnitude of impact, the asset’s heritage 
significance is defined. This allows the identification of key features and 
provides the baseline against which the magnitude of change can be 
assessed; the magnitude of impact being proportional to the degree of 
change in the asset’s baseline significance.

Table 13.2 Magnitude of Impact 
Magnitude 
Description 
Major  
Total or substantial loss of the 
significance of a heritage asset. 
Substantial harm to a heritage asset's 
setting, such that the significance of 
the asset would be totally lost or 
substantially reduced (e.g. the 
significance of a designated heritage 
asset would be reduced to such a 
degree that its designation would be 
questionable or the significance of an 
undesignated heritage asset would be 
reduced to such a degree that its 
categorisation as a heritage asset 
would be questionable). 
Moderate 
Partial loss or alteration of the 
significance of a heritage asset. 
Considerable harm to a heritage 
asset’s setting, such that the asset's 
significance would be materially 
affected/considerably devalued, but 
not totally or substantially lost. 
Minor  
Slight loss of the significance of a 
heritage asset.  This could include the 
removal of fabric that forms part of the 
heritage asset, but that is not integral 
to its significance (e.g. the demolition 
of later extensions/additions of little 
intrinsic value). 
Some harm to the heritage asset’s 
setting, but not to the degree that it 
would materially compromise the 
significance of the heritage asset. 
Perceivable level of harm, but 
insubstantial relative to the overall 
interest of the heritage asset.   
Negligible  
A very slight change to a heritage 
asset.  This could include a change to 
a part of a heritage asset that does not

Magnitude 
Description 
materially contribute to its significance. 
Very minor change to a heritage 
asset’s setting such that there is a 
slight impact not materially affecting 
the heritage asset’s significance. 
No Impact 
No change to a heritage asset or its 
setting. 
 
Significance of Effects 
13.2.17 The sensitivity of the receiving environment, together with the magnitude of 
impact, defines the significance of the effect (Table 13.3).  Where there is 
scope for two levels of impact (e.g. major/moderate), professional judgement 
has been used in the assessment as to the level of impact arising.  Impacts of 
moderate significance and above are considered to equate to significant 
impacts in the context of the EIA Regulations.

13.2.18 Where the significance of heritage assets is unknown, even if the magnitude 
of change could be reasonably estimated the significance of the effects would 
remain unknown.  Where such findings occur, then these have been noted in 
the assessment. 
Consultation and Consultation Responses 
13.2.19 Consultation is ongoing and will continue as part of the PEIR and EIA 
process.  The following organisations have been consulted to date both in 
order to obtain information of heritage assets and to assist in the scoping of 
the surveys and the future EIA.

Comment 
Required action or 
response 
Given the potential for this 
area to contain as yet 
unidentified archaeological 
remains the CBC 
Archaeological Officer 
considers that the 
collection of baseline 
information on archaeology for 
the gas and electrical 
connections 
should include an 
archaeological field evaluation 
comprising geophysical survey 
and trial 
trenching of the selected 
connection routes.  
Noted. The scope of 
such investigation, if 
required, will be agreed 
with relevant consultees 
once more detail about 
the final choice of gas 
and electrical connection 
routes is determined.  
The Environmental Statement 
should contain sufficient visual 
information to be able to 
assess the impact on the 
setting of assets including 
from the monuments and into 
them from a variety of 
locations, including view sites 
on the Greensand Ridge from 
the northern edge of the 
Marston Vale.  
 A preliminary 
assessment of the 
potential effects of the 
Project on the setting of 
cultural heritage assets 
is provided in Sections 
13.4 and 13.5 and will 
be further assessed in 
the ES. Further

13.3 Embedded Mitigation  
13.3.1 In order to undertake an assessment of the potential effects on archaeology 
and cultural heritage as a result of the construction, decommissioning and 
operation of the Project, it has been assumed that certain elements of 
‘embedded mitigation’ will be applied. These mitigation items can often be 
considered as standard, best practice working methods, without which the 
Project would not be allowed to be developed. In terms of protection of 
archaeology and cultural heritage, these standard mitigation measures 
include: 
� 
Adherence to a CEMP, which will set out the process for stopping work 
and notifying the appropriate person (usually the county archaeologist) if 
any remains of potential archaeological significance are found during 
construction; and  
� 
Directing development away from known areas of buried archaeology.

13.4 Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Non-designated Heritage Assets 
13.4.1 No features or structures of archaeological or historic interest have been 
recorded on the Bedfordshire HER within the Power Generation Plant Site, 
representative of the fact that it is located within a former clay extraction pit.  
However, it is recognised that the former Rookery Pit which, although not 
recorded on the HER, could be considered as a non-designated heritage 
asset of local significance.  
Designated Assets 
13.4.2 A review of the National Heritage List confirmed there to be no designated 
heritage assets within the Power Generation Plant Site. Tables 13.5-13.9 list 
the designated assets within the 5 km study area.  All designated heritage 
assets are considered to be of high sensitivity although their settings may not 
necessarily be as sensitive to change (i.e. direct physical change) as the 
assets themselves. 
13.4.3 The locations of designated assets within the 5 km study area are presented 
on Figure 13.1. The locations of non-designated assets within the 1 km study 
area are presented on Figure 13.2.

of the Power Generation Plant Site have been considered in detail. These are 
summarised in Table 13.7. The data for all grade II listed buildings within 5 
km of the Power Generation Plant Site has been collected, plotted and 
reviewed to identify any buildings of this grade beyond 2 km that are 
considered to have a highly sensitive setting.

Construction/Decommissioning 
13.4.5 The extent of any previous disturbance to buried archaeological remains is an 
important factor in assessing the potential impact of the Project.  
13.4.6  Given that the Power Generation Plant Site is within formerly developed land 
(e.g. previously excavated Rookery clay pits, it is likely that any archaeology 
would have already been removed. Therefore, this preliminary assessment 
has concluded that there will be no physical direct impacts on any designated 
heritage assets.   
13.4.7 The majority of the construction works will not be visible outside of Rookery 
South Pit and therefore will have no impacts on the setting of any designated 
heritage assets.   
13.4.8 The Access Road will have no potential impacts on designated heritage 
assets.

13.5 Gas Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
13.5.1 Land on which the Gas Connection Route Corridor Options 1 and 2 are 
situated is agricultural, and has remained undeveloped according to the 
earliest historical mapping data.  
Non-designated Heritage Assets 
13.5.2 A number of cropmarks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the Gas Connection Option 1 and for the area of investigation for Gas 
Connection Option 2.   Archaeological investigations (trial trenching) have 
been undertaken in the vicinity of Gas Connection Option 1 in relation to an 
unrelated previous proposed development. The archaeological evaluation 
failed to reveal archaeological remains within the small portion of the gas 
connection area that it considered despite the results of the cropmarks 
recorded within the area.    
13.5.3 An archaeological assessment of the Gas Connection Route Corridor Options 
1 and 2 has been undertaken which considers non-designated heritage 
assets within the Gas Connection areas and the inner and wider study areas 
in detail.  In summary, the archaeological potential of both of the Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Options, for the purposes of this preliminary 
assessment is summarised below.

Designated Heritage Assets 
13.5.4 There are no designated heritage assets within either Gas Connection Route 
Corridoroption 1 or 2.  The nature of the gas connection (below ground apart 
from the small AGI compound) means that there will be no effects on the 
settings of designated heritage assets within the wider study area.   
Construction/Decommissioning 
13.5.5 Construction of the Gas Connection options 1 and 2 has the potential to 
impact on both known and as yet unrecorded buried heritage assets, as land 
on which the options are located has remained as undeveloped agricultural 
land.   
13.5.6 Table 13.12 below summarises the potential effects of construction and 
decommissioning of the Gas Connection on heritage assets.

13.5.8 Given that the Route Corridor of both Gas Connection Options will be mainly 
buried, the Pipeline will not have any impacts on above ground heritage 
assets. The AGI will be a relatively small structure, screened by vegetation. It

is unlikely that it will give rise to any setting impacts on above ground heritage 
assets.  
13.5.9 The AGI would be far smaller and less intrusive than the Power Generation 
Plant, at this preliminary stage there are not considered to be any impacts to 
the setting of above ground heritage assets. 
13.6 Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Non-designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.1 A number of cropmarks of possible archaeological origin have been recorded 
within the area proposed to site the Electrical Connection.  Archaeological 
investigations have been undertaken in the northern part of this area in 
relation to an unrelated previous proposed development. This revealed the 
remains of an enclosed late Iron Age/Roman settlement and a possible 
prehistoric settlement either side of a former stream channel. The putative 
line of a Roman road crossed north west-south east across the south western 
part of the area. 
13.6.2 In summary, the archaeological potential of the Electrical Connection area, for 
the purposes of this preliminary assessment is summarised below.  
Later Upper Palaeolithic; low likelihood of presence 
Mesolithic; low likelihood of presence  
Neolithic; low likelihood of presence 
Bronze Age; low likelihood of presence 
Iron Age and Romano-British; known/high likelihood of presence

Designated Heritage Assets 
13.6.3 There are no designated heritage assets within the area of the proposed 
Electrical Connection.

the Project Site.  However, the preliminary archaeology assessment set out in 
this Section 13 of the PEIR has shown that no significant effects on heritage 
assets are predicted as a result of the Project.  Given that the Project alone is 
predicted to have no significant effects on heritage assets, it follows on that 
the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to any likely significant 
cumulative or in-combination effects with other developments in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that no cumulative impacts 
assessment is required.

14 Socio-economics 
14.1 Introduction 
14.1.1 This section of the PEIR presents the preliminary findings of the assessment 
of likely significant labour market, tourism economy and community 
infrastructure 
effects 
arising 
from 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project.  Potential effects could result from labour 
market distortions, pressure on community infrastructure facilities from 
construction workers and their families and potentially positive and negative 
effects on the tourism economy.   
14.2 Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
14.2.1 Relevant policy and guidance in relation to archaeology and cultural heritage 
is set out in Appendix 2.14.  
Assessment Methodology 
Study Area 
14.2.2 The proposed socio-economic and tourism study areas formed part of the 
consultation on methodology.  The study areas are as follows:   
� 
Socio economic study area - The socio-economic assessment is based 
on drive time catchment areas from the Project Site.  The ‘local area’ is 
defined within a 30 minute drive time, ‘wider area’ within a 45 minute drive 
time, and ‘wider region’ within a 60 minute drive time (see Figure 14.1).    
� 
Tourism study area - The tourism assessment is focussed on the area 
defined by a 15 km radius from the Project Site.  Facilities or notable 
points of focus of visitor attraction within this area have been reviewed.  
Any significant tourism facilities located just outside the boundary of the 
Project Site have also been included (Figure 14.2).    
� 
Community Infrastructure study area - The community infrastructure 
assessment is focussed on the area defined within a 15 km radius from 
the Project.  Proximity is likely to be the main determinant of impacts and 
their scale.  The status of community facility receptors in an area is also 
used to determine the scale and significance of any impacts. 
Review Available Data/Information 
14.2.3 Data and information from national, regional and local databases have been 
reviewed, identifying information gaps and requirements for data gathering 
e.g. business, accommodation and other surveys. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
289 
Baseline 
14.2.4 The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using standard 
indicators. This provides a baseline from which potential impacts can be 
assessed: 
� 
Socio-economic / Labour Market : the area has been defined using a 
combination of: standard sources and indicators; research available at 
study area level; and research into the business and labour market 
structure of the local economy; 
� 
Tourism economy: the area’s visitor attraction has been profiled including: 
visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and value; and 
the local tourism economy; 
� 
Community infrastructure:  An audit of community infrastructure has been 
prepared; and 
� 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other relevant policy 
has been reviewed to identify related economic, social and regeneration 
objectives which the Project may affect (whether contributing to their 
realisation or otherwise). 
Assessment of Potential Economic Impacts 
14.2.5 A detailed assessment of likely effects on the local, regional and national 
economy during construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project 
has been prepared. This assesses the scale of:  
� 
Direct economic impacts: jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA) that are 
wholly or largely related to construction, decommissioning, and operation 
and maintenance of the Project; 
� 
Indirect economic impacts (positive and negative): jobs and GVA 
generated in the study area in the chain of suppliers of goods and services 
to the direct activities; 
� 
Induced economic impacts: jobs and GVA created by direct and indirect 
employees’ spending in the study area or in the wider economy; and 
� 
Wider economic (catalytic) impacts (positive and negative): employment 
and income generated in the economy related to the wider role of the 
Project in influencing economic activities (including wider socio-economic 
effects).  
14.2.6 For economic impacts and effects (including employment), the availability of 
labour and skills is critical in accommodating the demands, needs and 
requirements of the proposed development. Adequate capacity results in a 
low sensitivity while a shortfall or constrained capacity results in a high 
sensitivity.   
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
290 
14.2.7 The key socio-economic indicators for the Study Area include: 
� 
The proportion of skilled workforce in the study area relative to national 
averages; 
� 
Educational attainment levels compared with national averages; 
� 
The proportion of employment in relevant sectors (i.e. manufacturing and 
construction workers) in the study area; 
� 
The availability of labour (including the unemployed workforce); and 
� 
Relevant education and training provision, including existing and proposed 
programmes provided by institutions serving the study area.  
Assessment of Potential Tourism Impacts 
14.2.8 Tourism and recreational behaviour will only be detrimentally affected where 
the effects of the Project either change the visitor/user pattern in terms of 
numbers, and /or their patterns of expenditure for the worse.  As such, 
opportunities for tourist and visitor expenditure, any potential variation in 
expenditure or visitor numbers, and consequent effects on turnover or 
employment are of key importance.     
14.2.9 A business survey has been carried out to gain a more detailed 
understanding 
of 
the 
local 
tourism 
economy 
and 
its 
current 
performance.  Businesses contacted include key visitor accommodation 
providers, leisure activity providers and other relevant tourism businesses. 
14.2.10 Visitor facilities and notable points of focus in the study area have been 
identified.  Based on the Project’s anticipated visibility, the assessment 
comments on the likelihood of the Project influencing visitor and tourist 
attitudes and behaviour towards them.  
14.2.11 The significance of effects on tourism is assessed by reference to the 
sensitivity of the receptor and the anticipated magnitude of impact.  
14.2.12 In considering the level of tourism sensitivity, the standing of the receptor or 
resource is the defining factor. This is established against: 
� 
Tourism business’ relative attraction to customers from outside the study 
area and the Project’s potential to influence broader perceptions of the 
study area.  Where a majority of trade is non-local this is more likely to be 
the case; and 
� 
the relative importance of tourism as a business sector. Where tourism is 
more important relative to other sectors, impacts may have the potential to 
generate broader impacts. Similarly, where it is of relatively low 
significance, impacts on tourism and related sectors are unlikely to 
generate a high level of adverse impact across the broader economy.

Assessment of Potential Community Infrastructure Effects 
14.2.13 An assessment of the likely significant effects on local, regional and national 
community receptors during construction, operation and decommissioning of 
the Project have been carried out. This assessment includes an audit of 
community infrastructure facilities/receptors within the local area and its 
associated effects (i.e. effects on local schools, local authority services and 
other infrastructure).  
Assessment of Potential Agricultural Land Impacts 
14.2.14 Significance of effects is defined by the combination of the sensitivity of 
receptors and the magnitude of impacts upon them. The criteria set out below 
are specific to socioeconomic factors and have been adopted to assess 
receptor sensitivity and impact magnitude. They therefore differ from those 
listed in Tables 4.1-4.3 of this PEIR.  
Determining Sensitivity of Economic Receptor 
14.2.15 Table 14.1 below sets out the criteria for determining the sensitivity of socio-
economic receptors. The criteria have been established by PBA following 
extensive socio-economic related environmental impact assessments of 
energy projects. 
Table 14.1 Socio-Economic Sensitivity Criteria 
Sensitivity  Example 
Very High 
The area has a shortfall of appropriate labour and skills. 
The Project would lead to excessive labour market pressure and 
distortions (i.e. skills and capacity shortages, import of labour, wage 
inflation). 
High  
The area has constrained supply of labour and skills.  
The Project would lead to labour market pressure and distortions (i.e. 
skills and capacity shortages, import of labour, wage inflation). 
Medium  
The area has a low/ limited supply of labour and skills.  
The Project could lead to labour market pressure or distortions. 
Low  
The receptor has a readily available labour force.  
The Project is unlikely to lead to labour market pressure or distortions.  
Negligible  
The area has a surplus of readily available labour with directly relevant 
and transferable skills. The Project will not lead to labour market 
pressure or distortions.   
 
Determining Socio-Economic Magnitude of Effect 
 
14.2.16 The magnitude of the effect of potential socio-economic impacts is assessed 
against the thresholds shown in Table 14.2.

Determining Sensitivity of Community Infrastructure Receptor 
14.2.19 In considering the level of community infrastructure sensitivity, the area 
served by the facility or that from which people travel to access it is the 
defining factor (Table 14.5).

Determining Magnitude of Community Infrastructure Effect 
14.2.20 The magnitude of the effect on community infrastructure is gauged by 
estimating the amount of change on the receptor arising from the scheme.  
The magnitude of change is evaluated in line with the criteria below (Table

Significance of effect 
14.2.21 In line with standard EIA practice, the sensitivity of receptors as defined in the 
tables above (Table 14.1, Table 14.2 and Table 14.3) are considered against 
the Magnitude of impact (Table 14.4, Table 14.5 and Table 14.6) to determine 
the significance of effect (Table 14.7).

Worst Case Scenario for Assessment  
14.2.22 In respect of socio-economics, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Sections 2 and 5 of 
the PEIR) are five aero derivative gas turbine generators, each with their own 
40 m high stack. 
14.2.23 The different options for the configuration of the Generating Equipment have 
little bearing on the impact to socio-economics. However, it is recognised that 
installing only 1 gas turbine generator at this site will have a marginally lower 
construction and operational workforce than installing a greater number of 
units.  
14.2.24 A preliminary assessment of both Route Corridor Options for the Gas 
Connection is presented in this section. The worst case scenario for the 
Electrical Connection of a double circuit overhead line and seven new towers 
(one of which will be replacing an existing tower, thereby resulting in six net 
additional towers) has been assessed.

Scoping 
Response 
Letter 
We are not convinced that 
the proposed facility will 
enhance the local 
economy as only 15 full 
time jobs have been 
identified. 
 We consider that this will 
have minor benefits to the 
local economy, as will the 
number of construction 
jobs.  
There will be a detrimental 
effect on existing property 
prices which in turn will 
depress economic activity 
and undermine the 
ambition of local 
communities to develop as 
tourist destinations. 
 We do not agree that 
siting the project in this 
location would 
detrimentally impact the 
area such that tourists 
would be put off. An 
assessment of potential 
tourist related impacts in 
included in Section 14.5 of 
this PEIR.

Socio-economics 
14.3.1 This socio-economic profile examines the key indicators and measures of 
socio-economic activity in the study area which is divided into the following 
tiers:  
� 
‘local area’ defined within a 30 minute drive time,  
� 
‘wider area’ defined within a 45 minute drive time, and  
� 
‘wider region’ defined within a 60 minute drive time. 
Population 
14.3.2 The local, wider area and wider region has experienced relatively significant 
population increases since 2001, a trend which is expected to continue over

the coming years to 2021.  Over the same period the population of the UK 
has increased and is also projected to increase but at a lesser rate.

Age Structure 
14.3.4 The local area has a declining proportion of working age people and an 
increasing dependency ratio18 which is likely to put additional pressure on 
services in the area.  By 2021 over a fifth of the local area's population is

14.3.7 The local area is characterised by marginally higher levels of unemployment 
compared to wider area and region.  The level of unemployment is however 
broadly comparable to the UK average.  The local area, wider area and wider 
region have slightly higher proportions of self- employed people which may 
indicate a more dynamic entrepreneurial workforce. This is summarised in

Social Grade/ Skills 
14.3.9 National Readership Survey (NRS) social grades are a system of 
demographic classification widely used in market research20.  Compared to 
the UK average the local area has a higher proportion of people in the highest 
social grades (AB) and second highest (C1) grade.  It also has a lower 
proportion of people in lowest social grades (DE) compared to the national 
average.  The wider area and wider region have higher proportions of people 
in the highest social grade (AB), than that of the local area and UK average.

Summary 
14.3.11 
The socio-economic study area22 surrounding the Project is characterised by: 
� 
An increasing population (2001-2013) c.4% above the nationally rate; 
� 
Projected population increase of c.7% between 2013 and 2021, which is 
higher than the UK average; 
� 
a rapidly growing retirement age population; 
� 
an economic activity rate higher than the UK average; 
� 
lower levels of unemployment comparable to the UK average; 
� 
A comparable proportion of people working in the manufacturing and 
construction sector;   
� 
High proportion of people in highly skilled jobs and lower proportion of 
people employed in semi-skilled/unskilled jobs; 
� 
low proportion of people with no qualifications; and 
� 
High proportion of people achieving the highest qualifications comparable 
to the UK average. 
14.3.12 
The socio-economic study area exhibits some characteristics consistent with 
a low sensitivity labour market (i.e. readily available skilled labour, increasing 
population, above average economic activity, high educational attainment).  
This suggests that the Project will not lead to any undue labour market 
pressure or distortions (i.e. wage inflation, skills and capacity shortages, 
import of labour). 
14.3.13 
The overall sensitivity of the labour market is assessed as low.23

Tourism 
14.3.14 
Tourism volume and value indicators such as domestic tourist trips, bed-
nights and spending in Central Bedfordshire have generally mirrored regional 
and national trends since 2006.  Central Bedfordshire has however 
experienced much greater variation between periods.     
14.3.15 
Tourism volume and value in Central Bedfordshire recovered strongly during 
the period 2011-13 and now accounts for approximately one third of 
Bedfordshire’s tourism economy.  Previously Central Bedfordshire accounted 
for approximately a quarter of Bedfordshire’s tourism volume and value. 
Tourist trips and bed-nights are now at their highest level since 2006.   
14.3.16 On average 204 million trips were taken to Central Bedfordshire between 
2011-13 which equated to 53 million bed-nights.  The annual value of 
these trips was £507 million. This is summarised in Table 14.16.

14.3.17  Visitor numbers to Bedfordshire and Central Bedfordshire visitor attractions 
have generally increased in recent years.    Central Bedfordshire has two 
attractions in the top 20 free attractions and one attraction in the top 20 
                                                                                                                                                                      
23 The socio-economic study area exhibits some characteristics consistent with a low sensitivity labour market (i.e. 
readily available skilled labour, increasing population, above average economic activity, high educational 
attainment)

unpaid tourist attractions in the East of England.  The Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park and the RSPB The Lodge Nature Reserve are 
listed by Visit England as the 4th and 18th most visited free attractions in the 
East of England in 2013.24   ZSL Whipsnade Zoo located in Central 
Bedfordshire was listed as most popular paid visitor attraction in the East of 
England25.   
14.3.18 Visitor trips, bed-nights, spending and visitor numbers to key attractions are 
increasing.   The overall sensitivity of the Central Bedfordshire’s tourism 
economy is therefore assessed as low.   
14.3.19 The Marston Vale Millennium Country Park is located within close proximity of 
the Project Site.  Woburn Abbey is also located with 5km.  Both attractions 
will be assessed as individual receptors and included in the tourism business 
survey to establish perceived impact on visitor activity.  The remaining 
attractions are outwith the 15km study area.  
14.3.20 The overall sensitivity of the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park and 
Woburn Abbey is assessed as medium.   
14.3.21 Demand for community infrastructure facilities could arise from the in-
migration of construction workers and their families during the temporary 
construction phase.  This requirement is likely to be minimal.   An initial audit 
of community facilities also shows there is sufficient capacity to accommodate 
additional demand.   
14.3.22 The community infrastructure audit has identified:  
� 
15 schools within c.5km of the Project site (capacity for 204 pupils);  
� 
Six GP surgeries (all accepting new patients);  
� 
One hospital; 
� 
Five pharmacies; and 
� 
One library.  
14.3.23 The overall sensitivity of the local area’s community infrastructure has 
therefore been assessed as low.

14.4 Gas Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
14.4.1 The Gas Connection would be in the form of a new underground gas pipeline 
connection and AGI.  Both gas connection Route Corridor Options 1 and 2 
are situated to the south and east of the Generating Equipment Site in gently 
rolling arable fields bounded by hedgerows and drainage ditches.   
14.4.2 As the baseline assessment considered the Project as a whole, the baseline 
conditions reported above for the Power Generation Plant can be considered 
as representative of both Gas Connection route corridors as well.  
Construction/Decommissioning 
14.4.3 Table 14.19 below summarises the impacts of the Gas Connection on the 
socio-economics of the area. This applies for both Route Corridor Options 1 
and 2.

14.5 Electrical Connection Assessment 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
14.5.1 As set out in sections 2.5 and 5.5 of this PEIR,  the Electrical Connection is 
likely to  comprise up to seven new towers (one of which will be replacing an 
existing tower, thereby resulting in six net additional towers), a new substation 
and up to two new overhead line electrical circuits.  
14.5.2 As the baseline assessment considered the Project as a whole, the baseline 
conditions reported above for the Power Generation Plant can be considered 
as representative of the Electrical Connection route corridors as well.

14.7 Cumulative Impacts 
14.7.1 The Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.  However, the preliminary socio-economic assessment set 
out in this Section 14 of the PEIR has shown that there are minor positive 
effects associated with the Project. Should construction, decommissioning or 
operation occur simultaneously with any other projects in the area, it is 
anticipated that this would enhance local benefits for goods, services and 
employment, resulting in a minor positive cumulative effect.  
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report

15 Other Issues Considered 
15.1 Introduction 
15.1.1 It is recognised that some of the statutory consultees have raised concerns 
that the Project may give rise to environmental impacts over and above those 
described in Sections 6-14 of this PEIR. Specifically, it has been requested 
that the Applicant assesses waste arising from the Project and 
Electromagnetic Frequency (EMF) arising from operation of the Electrical 
Connection.  
15.1.2 This section of the PEIR therefore looks to address these potential impacts.  
15.2 Waste 
15.2.1 As part of the construction works, there is likely to be limited potential for the 
generation of waste given that the LLRS will ensure that a level platform is 
created in the base of the Rookery South Pit on which to site the Generating 
Equipment. There may be small amounts of waste spoil produced from 
excavations for foundations, for the Gas Connection and for the new towers 
associated with the Electrical Connection, although it is hoped that as much 
of this as possible can be re-used on site.  
15.2.2 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework 
Directive, the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 
(where relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the Project, will seek to apply 
the waste hierarchy as part of their waste prevention and management policy. 
15.2.3 The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
� 
 Prevention; 
� 
 Re-use; 
� 
Recycling; 
� 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
� 
Disposal 
15.2.4 A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of construction 
method statements for approval by the local authority prior to commencement 
of construction, secured by a requirement attached to the DCO. 
15.2.5 Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used 
on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from 
de-watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
319 
15.2.6 In order to facilitate the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive 
during decommissioning, much of the structures and equipment for the 
proposed Project will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far as is 
practicable. For example, a large proportion of the buildings will be 
constructed of pre-fabricated steel and will therefore be of interest to scrap 
metal merchants. 
15.2.7 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the 
Project Site at any time, and any such substances will be held in secured 
containers to prevent contaminant migration. Closed storage facilities or 
suitable dampening techniques will be utilised within the Project where 
emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible. All mitigation measures will be 
in full accordance with industry good practices. 
15.2.8 The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a 
manner that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project 
Site) waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. 
Where hazardous waste is transported from the proposed Project Site, it will 
be handled in accordance with relevant regulations, and, where necessary, 
be transported in sealed tankers. 
15.2.9 During operation a feature of the gas turbine generator technology to be 
incorporated in the proposed Project is that waste generated should be 
minimal and will be restricted to the following: 
� 
General office wastes; 
� 
Used GT air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
� 
Used ion exchange resins or used RO membranes (typically replaced 
every 5 to 10 years); 
� 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
� 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
15.2.10 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that the proposed Project will 
result in no adverse impacts with respect to waste.  
15.3 EMF 
15.3.1 The potential effects of electric and magnetic fields is a very specialised area 
which relies upon extensive work of worldwide experts. UK Power developers 
(such as the Applicant) rely on national guidelines in accordance with 
Government advice to ensure that new installations consider health risks 
based on current knowledge. The UK’s Health Protection Agency, previously 
the National Radiological Protection Board NRPB, provides independent 
recommendations to the Government based on reviews of international study 
results. 
 
Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
 
 
320 
15.3.2 In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to 
power-frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by 
the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 
are adopted in the UK as recommended by the NRPB. 
15.3.3 Based on these guidelines, it is likely that that the EMF field strength for the 
Project would be the same as that which is already present associated with 
the existing 400kV Sundon to Grendon overhead line, and that the field 
strength remains within the1998 ICNIRP occupational exposure Reference 
Level. 
15.3.4 A full EMF report will be produced as part of the ongoing EIA and reported in 
the ES.
