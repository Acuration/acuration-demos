Solids, liquids and gases
All materials are either a solid, a liquid, or a gas - these are the three states of 
matter. All materials are made up of particles and particles behave in different ways 
depending on the material’s state.
Solids
Liquids
Gases
Don’t flow
The particles are tightly 
packed and cannot 
move past each other.
The particles vibrate.
Don’t compress easily
There is very little space 
between the particles 
for movement.
Keep their own shape
The particles are tightly 
locked in place.
Can flow and be 
poured easily
Particles can move 
easily past each other.
The particles have some 
movement energy.
Don’t compress easily
There is little space 
between the particles.
Take the shape  
of containers
Particles can move past 
each other and are 
easily poured.
Can flow easily
Particles can move very 
easily past each other.
The particles have lots 
of energy and move fast.
Can be  
compressed easily
There’s lots of space 
between the particles.
Take the shape  
of containers
The particles can move 
easily past each other.

Did you know?
At Drax Power Station, we have 
examples of all three states of matter.
Turbines
Fascinating fact
Most metals are solid at room temperature. Mercury, 
the silvery liquid used in thermometers, is an exception.
Some solids, such as sand and sugar, 
can appear to behave like a liquid 
as they can be poured. This is 
because of the tiny size of the 
particles that make up the solid.
