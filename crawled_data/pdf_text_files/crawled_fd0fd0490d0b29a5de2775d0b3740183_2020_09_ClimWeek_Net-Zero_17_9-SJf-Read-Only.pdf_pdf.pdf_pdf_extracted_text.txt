The core arithmetic of net-zero is harsh and unforgiving:
We are failing & We’re out of time

50% reduction 
in 10 years  
for 1.5°C 
The core 
arithmetic of 
net-zero is 
clarifying:
All sectors
All approaches
Only one way to stabilize climate: net-zero everywhere
• Any emissions anywhere add to atmospheric CO2 concentration
• Every year of delay makes problem worse
• We haven’t yet fielded solutions for about 50% of the portfolio
For net zero: CO2emissions - CO2removals = 0
• Any residual emissions must be balanced by removal
• Likely need 10 Gt/y CO2 removal by 2050
• Any delay or failure requires more CO2 removal
Carbon from the earth must be returned to the earth
• Natural systems must return to balance
• Biosphere has limited capacity
• Risk of return is getting worse
CO2 return to the geosphere anchors 
the net-zero global economy
Zero-C power is not enough for 2030 or 2050
Geospheric Return enables more sectors and more speed

IPCC (2014): Without CCUS, 50% of climate-energy models fail
IPCC (2014): Without CCUS, the models that solve cost ~140% more
IPCC (2018): All 2 °C models have ~4Gt CCS
IPCC (2018): All 1.5 °C models have ~4Gt CCS + 2-5 Gt CO2 removal using CCS
By the 
numbers
10 nations have commercial CCS facilities
• U.S., Canada, Norway, Algeria, Australia, China, UAE, Saudi 
Arabia, Qatar, Brazil
• Countries in advanced development: Netherlands, Japan, U.K.
• 10 nations mention CCS in their NDCs
21 operating facilities world-wide
• ~40M tons/year anthropogenic CO2
• ~260M tons cumulative
• Facilities: Power (2) hydrogen (5), steel (1), chemicals (2) 
ethanol (1), natural gas processing (many)
• Over 100 pilot and demo projects with >20 years of science
• Monitoring tools and regulatory framework well established
Science & technology well established
• First commercial carbon capture facility: 1938
• First large-scale CO2 injection: 1972
• First geospheric return project: 1996 (Sleipner, Norway)
Key benefits: saves time, saves money, reduces risk
Can decarbonize existing assets without waiting for retirement

Cheaper than many decarbonization and CO2 removal options
CCS deployment 
is not about cost 
– it’s about 
finance
CCS projects 
(power, H2, & 
industry) are lower 
cost & more 
effective than many 
existing policies
Same is true for 
DACS & BECCS

Decision
Bankable long-term value on CO2
C price, CO2 storage bounty, Tax Credit, 
Regulation, Govt. procurement policy 
Comparison to alternate investment options
Reduce Cost to Investors
Material capital grants, Concessional 
finance/guarantees, Support geological 
storage resource appraisal 
Reduce Risk to Investors
Support CCS hubs and CO2 transport and 
storage infrastructure. Clear & predictable 
regulation. Long term liability management.
Key policies & investment enable CCS finance
Valorize, incentivize, de-risk
Economies of 
scale in CO2
transport and 
injection 
infrastructure
Multiple 
counterparties 
reduces cross-
chain risk and 
delivers higher 
utilization of 
assets
Hub infrastructure
Key to reducing risks and activating markets
Stabilization 
requires net-zero
Carbon taken 
from the 
geosphere 
requires return 
to the geosphere
CCS is an anchor of the zero-carbon global economy
• Power sector, heavy industry, zero-C hydrogen
• CO2 removal with direct air capture, BECCS, C mineralization
Policy support is essential
• Infrastructure first:
• Hubs & Clusters
• CO2 pipelines
• Project finance support – many, many mechanisms
• Ecosystem cultivation
• Innovation policy
• Pore volume access & long-term liability clarity
• London Convention Amendment

CCUS 
deployment is 
not about cost: 
it’s about 
finance
Policy is 
essential for 
deployment
Infrastructure
• Pipelines; industrial hubs & clusters
• Pore-volume access & storage site characterization
Capital support
• Investment tax credits
• Grants (e.g., demonstrations, Projects of Common Interest)
Revenue enhancements
• Feed-in tariffs; Contract for Differences
• Production Tax Credits; government procurement
Other policies
• Mandates (e.g., zero-carbon power standards; retrofits)
• Innovation support (industrial policy; Mission Innovation)
Market aligning policies close the finance gap
Essential Policy 3: Ecosystem Support
Essential Policy 2: Support project finance
Infrastructure
Capital support
• Investment tax credits
• Grants (e.g., demonstrations, PCI)
• Low-cost capital (esp. in developing nations)
Revenue enhancements
• Feed-in tariffs; Contract for Differences
• Production Tax Credits; government procurement
