Biomass Transformation Highlights 
 
Biomass now more than 20% of Drax output  
- 
First converted unit performing very well 
- 
Enhanced co-firing (ECF) unit operating from May burning at least 85% biomass - performing well and in line 
with plan 
 
Good progress with unit optimisation - secures unit flexibility and improved capacity / efficiency 
 
UK and US construction projects on schedule and to budget 
- 
Drax site biomass storage and delivery systems fully operational for first two units 
 
Regulation remains uncertain, but more clarity expected 
- 
Early CfD awards still subject to EU State aid clearance. Second unit also dependent on final conclusion of 
the legal challenge  
- 
CfD contracts underpin the investment required to secure timely delivery of the sustainable biomass supply 
chain for future unit conversions 
 
Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive of Drax, said:  
“We are pleased to have delivered another good operating performance across our biomass and coal generation 
business. However, as expected, in the short term the increasing cost of the UK carbon tax drove EBITDA down year 
on year. We have been investing significant capital to transform Drax into one of Europe’s largest renewable power 
generators, burning sustainable biomass, thereby improving the long term value proposition for the Group. 
 
“The regulatory landscape still presents uncertainties, but positive progress is being made and we hope that most of 
the key issues will be clarified in the coming months.  
 
“Our underlying business case remains strong. In 2016, half of Drax Power Station will be fuelled by sustainable 
biomass, delivering 4% of the UK’s electricity. Through this transformation we will provide cost-effective, low carbon 
and reliable renewable power to the UK consumer.  
 
“At the core of the Group is a very high quality power station, hugely important to the security of electricity supply in 
the UK. We will remain critical to UK infrastructure for a very long time to come.”

Chairman’s introduction 
 
During the first half of 2014 we have built on our achievements of last year and remain well placed to deliver an 
attractive future for our business and our shareholders. We are committed to our biomass strategy which will see 
Drax transformed into a predominantly biomass-fuelled power provider. Importantly, we are on track to successfully 
deliver, albeit in the context of some significant regulatory uncertainties. There are a number of areas where we 
need to work further with the UK government and other stakeholders to secure better regulatory clarity for our 
business. This will be an area of focus in the coming months. 
 
The Group performed well in the first half of this year although, as expected, EBITDA was lower than for the same 
period last year reflecting the increasing cost of the UK carbon tax. In accordance with our dividend policy, 
shareholders will receive an interim ordinary dividend of 4.7 pence per share in October, equivalent to 
approximately £19 million. 
 
Good progress has been made in all three of our business activities – upstream development of wood pellet supply 
chain assets, power generation, and downstream supply of power to business customers. Our three projects in the 
US Gulf are on schedule and to budget. Sustainable biomass now fuels more than one-fifth of our electricity 
generation output. Finally, our retail arm continues to provide value to the Group, as it delivers sales growth and 
offers a credit-efficient route to market. 
 
We remain convinced of the important role that sustainable biomass has to play in the UK energy mix. We only buy 
biomass that complies with our industry-leading sustainability policy. This ensures that we deliver a cost effective, 
low carbon and reliable source of renewable power which is good for the consumer, good for the environment and 
good for security of supply. 
  
My thanks go to all Group staff for their contribution to what has been a successful first half of the year.

Chief Executive’s statement 
 
Introduction 
We delivered strong operations across the Group’s businesses in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, as 
expected, profits are down compared to the same period last year due to the increasing expense of the UK 
government’s carbon tax. 
 
We remain on track with our strategy to transform the business into a predominantly biomass-fuelled electricity 
generator and supplier. However, the regulatory landscape presents some uncertainties. We expect most of these 
to be clarified during the remainder of the year. In the meantime, we are working with the UK government and other 
stakeholders as appropriate. 
 
Commodity market conditions for coal and renewable generators have weakened since the start of the year. This 
was primarily caused by a warm and windy winter. The UK has had good supplies of gas which, given lower than 
normal demand, has resulted in high gas storage which in turn has had a dampening effect on the gas and power 
markets. In addition, high wind generation has resulted in higher than forecast supplies of renewable power.  
 
Business review 
 
Safety and sustainability 
Safety and sustainability are the foundations of our operating philosophy, underpinning all that we do. On safety we 
have again delivered better than first quartile performance during the first half of the year. Our safety performance 
should be considered against the backdrop of the considerable construction activity we are currently undertaking in 
both the UK and the US. We have delivered excellent safety performance at the Drax Power Station site across 
construction and business as usual operations. In the US, safety performance at our construction sites has seen 
some improvement, but does not yet meet the standard of our UK operations.  
 
We remain committed to our industry leading sustainability policy for biomass procurement. All the biomass we 
source complies with our policy, which includes only buying biomass that delivers major carbon savings determined 
by a full life cycle (or carbon footprint) analysis. A programme of independent audits verifies compliance with our 
policy and, further, that our fibre sourcing strategy will meet the UK mandatory standards when they come into 
force in 2015.  
 
We continue to advocate the need for harmonised, mandatory sustainability criteria for solid biomass used in 
electricity production across Europe. To that end, together with other large European biomass generators, we are 
working with the Sustainable Biomass Partnership to establish common, robust sustainability standards and 
certification processes. 
 
Generation performance 
We have delivered good operating performance from our coal units, with availability and load factors slightly ahead 
of that reported for the same period last year. The biomass units overall are also delivering good availability and 
load factors. 
  
Sustainable biomass now represents more than 20% of our fuel mix. The unit which was fully converted to burn 
biomass in April 2013 continues to perform very well. In May of this year, as planned, a second unit began 
operating as an enhanced co-firing unit, which means it burns at least 85% sustainable biomass with the remainder 
coal. This unit is performing well as it goes through commissioning procedures in its early period of operation.  
 
We entered the second half of the year with forward sales approximately equal to 95% of our anticipated 
generation output. As we approach delivery we expect to buy back power for some of these sales as we make use 
of the flexibility of our generation facilities to respond to changes in electricity demand. 
 
Retail performance 
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”), continues to provide a credit-efficient route to market 
and growth in sales. Sales volumes are up on the same period last year, with good credit quality and low bad debt 
experience.

Regulatory Update 
The regulatory landscape is a key external influence for our biomass and coal business.  
 
In terms of biomass, our first unit conversion to full biomass and our enhanced co-firing unit are supported under 
the Renewables Obligation (“RO”). The next step in our plan to transform Drax into a predominantly biomass-
fuelled power provider is to complete our second unit conversion by fully converting the enhanced co-firing unit to 
burn 100% biomass, either later this year or early next year.   
 
At the start of the year we had expected to be awarded an early contract for difference (Investment Contract) under 
the forthcoming contracts for difference (“CfD”) regime to support our second unit conversion. The unit was 
assessed as eligible to receive an Investment Contract through the first two stages of the award allocation process. 
However, in April during the final stage of the process the government concluded that this second unit conversion 
was no longer eligible. As there had been no changes to our plans for this unit, we elected to challenge 
government’s decision through the High Court. The hearing was held in July and concluded with a judgment in our 
favour which quashed the decision, ordered that the unit conversion be deemed eligible and remitted the matter 
back to government for reconsideration. Government has since awarded an Investment Contract for our second 
unit conversion. However, it has also appealed the High Court judgment. The Investment Contract is thus subject 
to the outcome of the appeal, and if the final conclusion of the legal challenge upholds the High Court judgment the 
Investment Contract will be subject to EU State aid clearance. 
 
Our third unit conversion was awarded an Investment Contract in April. This has now been executed, but is subject 
to EU State aid clearance. Clearance is required both for the enduring CfD scheme and individual projects (with a 
capacity of more than 250MW) which have been awarded Investment Contracts. Encouragingly, in July the 
European Commission approved the enduring CfD scheme, as a whole, for State aid, and also cleared the five off-
shore wind projects that had been awarded Investment Contracts. However, the Commission has yet to consider 
whether any of the biomass generation projects awarded Investment Contracts, which includes our third unit 
conversion and potentially our second, comply with EU State aid rules. We now expect these projects to be 
assessed after the summer. 
 
We have also continued to develop plans to convert a fourth unit. That unit could be supported under the enduring 
CfD regime, or depending on the timing, possibly under the RO. The government has announced the provisional 
budgets for the first allocation round of CfD awards (the enduring CfDs). No budget was made available for 
biomass conversions as the government elected to use the limited budget it made available for this round to 
support established and less-established technologies, such as on-shore and off-shore wind. No guidance has 
been given on the biomass conversion budget for the second round which we expect will be launched in 2015. 
However, the UK government has secured EU State aid clearance to support biomass conversions through 
dedicated tenders (that is, technology specific) up to 2017 as opposed to competitive tenders with other renewable 
technologies. 
 
In June, government published its final electricity market reform policy decisions, which included guidelines for the 
first capacity auction in December 2014 for delivery in 2018. We consider that the capacity market, as now 
designed, is a viable option for Drax’s coal units. In July, the government also secured EU State aid clearance for 
its capacity market proposals. 
 
Biomass supply chain 
We continue to make good progress with our biomass sourcing for near-term volumes. Some short term reductions 
in demand for biomass in mainland Europe and the UK has assisted with sourcing these volumes. Negotiations are 
progressing for the second and third unit conversions. Contracts for these long-term volumes were to be 
underpinned by Investment Contracts and inevitably government’s April decision and our legal challenge that 
followed have caused some delays.  
Our biomass supply chain projects in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi are proceeding well. We 
are constructing two pellet plants, with a combined capacity of 900 thousand tonnes a year, and a port facility, of 3 
million tonnes a year export capacity. All three projects are proceeding to schedule and are within budget. 
Commercial operations for the first pellet plant and the port facility are scheduled for the first quarter of 2015 and 
for the second pellet plant in the second quarter of 2015. Full capacity will be reached six months later. 
We are also evaluating options to build more pellet plants and port facilities with the aim of securing attractive 
returns and greater control of sustainable supply chains that we can leverage to our commercial advantage. We 
have identified the potential to accelerate investment in a third pellet plant in the US Gulf region and we are 
evaluating the possibility of a US East coast pellet operation. 
8 
 
Completing the biomass supply chain we expect to have UK port and rail capacity of 6 million tonnes fully 
operational by the end of the year. Finally, all construction activity on the Drax Power Station site is scheduled for 
completion in the third quarter of this year. 
Industrial Emissions Directive 
In preparation for compliance with the Industrial Emissions Directive, which comes into force in 2016, we 
conducted trials during the first half of year on our lead technical solution which includes low nitrogen oxides 
(“NOX”) burners and selective non-catalytic reduction (“SNCR”) technology. The trials have been successful and 
we are now moving forward with an investment plan to equip all six of the units at the power station with low NOX 
burners and SNCR capability.  
Carbon Capture and Storage 
Together, Alstom UK Limited, Drax and BOC (a member of The Linde Group) have formed a consortium, Capture 
Power Limited, in support of the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage (“CCS”) Project, a proposed 426MW 
oxy-combustion CCS demonstration project located at the Drax Power Station site, with the transport and storage 
elements of the project provided by National Grid.  
Following the award of grant funding for a Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) study under the 
government’s CCS Commercialisation Programme, the government submitted a funding application to the 
European Commission for the project under the second call of the European NER 300 programme. In July, the 
Commission announced a funding award decision of up to €300 million in favour of the project.  
Outlook 
The business is on track to complete our transformation into a predominantly biomass-fuelled power provider by 
having three operational converted biomass units in 2016 and three units fuelled by coal. At a minimum we would 
expect two of the converted biomass units to be supported through the Renewables Obligation and the third with 
an Investment Contract, whilst our coal units would continue to earn revenue through the wholesale power market 
and our retail business, Haven Power. 
We will continue to work to provide upside to this core investment. Should we be successful in our legal challenge 
post appeal, the business would benefit from two of the converted units being supported by Investment Contracts, 
with the associated protection of private law contracts and income stability. 
We continue to progress options for converting a fourth unit to biomass, which could be under the Renewables 
Obligation or, if budget is made available in the 2015 CfD allocation, potentially supported by an enduring CfD. 
The government’s final design proposals for the capacity market now represent an attractive opportunity for reliable 
generators to support electricity security. We expect to bid our coal units into the first auction this winter for delivery 
of reliable capacity in 2018. 
Finally, at the end of 2015 having completed the FEED study, we expect to take a final investment decision on the 
White Rose CCS Project. This will be dependent on successful outcomes of the study, funding arrangements and 
the terms of the proposed CfD contract for the project. Whilst clearly an interesting and important project, we will 
only progress this investment if it delivers an appropriate return on capital, commensurate with the technical and 
commercial risks.  
In summary, it is a complex picture for our stakeholders to evaluate. However, the issues in our direct control have 
gone very well, and in areas where we have less control, in particular the regulatory landscape, positive progress is 
being made. 
At the core of the Group is a very high quality power station, hugely important to the security of supply in the UK. 
We will remain critical to UK electricity infrastructure for a very long time to come.

Operational and financial performance 
 
Introduction 
EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was £102 million, compared to £120 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2013.    
 
Our results for the first half of 2014 were supported by good operational performance. The first converted biomass 
unit continues to perform very well, and our enhanced co-firing unit, which came on line in May of this year, is 
operating to plan during its commissioning period. 
 
The Generation business remains predominantly coal-fired and is subject to increases in the cost of carbon 
incurred through the ending of free carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions allowances at the end of 2012 and the 
introduction of carbon tax from the UK carbon price support (“CPS”) mechanism in April 2013.  As such, we have 
experienced an expected reduction in profitability compared to the first six months of 2013.  
 
Looking forward, earnings will continue to be impacted by the increasing carbon costs until our biomass generation 
becomes more substantial. 
 
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”), provides the Group with a credit-efficient route to 
market for power, ROCs and LECs, and continues to deliver good volume growth with sales of 5.6TWh in the six 
months to 30 June 2014 compared to 3.6TWh during the same period in 2013. 
 
The £18 million reduction in EBITDA, coupled with significant increases in ROC assets arising from increased 
biomass generation, has driven a reduction in cash generated from operations to £64 million for the first half of 
2014 compared to £129 million in 2013.  The majority of ROCs generated in 2014 will be sold in 2015, at which 
point the cash will be realised. 
 
In support of our biomass transformation, continued investment at Drax Power Station combined with the 
development of pellet plant and port facilities in the US are reflected in capital expenditure of £123 million in the 
first half of 2014 (2013: £138 million). 
 
Our balance sheet remains strong. In May this year we agreed a new £100 million private placement with M&G 
Investments, which complements our existing financing structure secured in previous years and provides additional 
liquidity to the Group. This results in total loans outstanding of £325 million and net debt at 30 June 2014 of £38 
million. 
 
The Board has resolved to pay an interim dividend for 2014 of 4.7 pence per share (£19 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2014, compared to 8.7 pence per share (£35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2013. 
 
This review provides further explanation and commentary on the results for the first half.

Generation gross profit 
The generation gross profit for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was £198 million, down 4% compared to £207 
million in 2013. The expected impact of the UK carbon tax, although mitigated somewhat by the increase of 
biomass in our fuel mix, meant that profits for the first six months of 2014 were lower than the same period last 
year. 
 
The cost of the UK carbon tax will continue to erode the profit margins of coal generating plant. This supports the 
economic case for the strategy we have developed to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator. 
 
Revenue 
Total generation revenue for the six months ending 30 June 2014 was £1,060 million compared to £785 million in 
2013. 
Our generation business recognises revenue when it sells power into the wholesale market, or to Haven Power. 
We can meet our power delivery obligations either by generating the power ourselves or, when it is more 
economical to do so, by buying power from the market. 
Power purchases of £344 million (2013: £139 million) are included within cost of sales and the associated revenue 
within power sales. Falling market power prices during the first half of 2014 have resulted in an increase in market 
purchases as the overnight power price more frequently fell below our marginal cost of production at the point of 
delivery. The growing level of intermittent generation on the electricity system in the UK, which contributes to falling 
power prices, is also providing opportunities to capitalise on the flexibility of the Drax plant through balancing and 
system support activities.  
Excluding the cost of power purchased in the market, our power sales revenue of £658 million was higher than for 
the first six months of 2013 (£631 million). This reflects a 2% increase in our generation to 12.9TWh in the first six 
months of 2014 from 12.6TWh in 2013, due to improved availability of our plant, and also an increase in the 
average selling price which we achieved for our power from £50.1 per MWh for the first six months of 2013 to £51.3 
per MWh in 2014.  The timing of our hedges has provided protection from recent power market weakness. 
 
Generation revenue also includes sales of ROCs and LECs, totalling £38 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2014 compared to £2 million in 2013.  Biomass now represents 23% of our fuel mix (2013: 7%) resulting in 
entitlement to considerably more ROCs and LECs. ROC support is recognised in the income statement as a 
deduction from cost of sales in the month in which it is earned from burning the biomass. The related asset is 
capitalised on our balance sheet until transfer of the title and a sale occurs.  The balance sheet position is shown 
below:

The timing of ROC sales is largely driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation deadlines and commercial 
considerations.  Consequently, the majority of the ROCs generated in 2014 will be sold in 2015.  The resulting 
impact upon cash flow is explained further in the liquidity and capital resources section.   
 
Cost of sales 
Our fuel costs are driven by a combination of market prices at the time of securing the fuel and the mix of different 
fuels burnt during the period.   
UK and EU legislation (the UK carbon tax mechanism introduced in April 2013 and Phase III of the EU Emissions 
Trading Scheme, which removed free carbon allowances at the end of 2012), have increased the cost of burning 
coal and supports our transformation strategy, which sees biomass as an increasing proportion of our fuel mix.

As can be seen in the table above, fuel costs in respect of generation were £482 million during the six months 
ended 30 June 2014 (2013: £409 million). The average cost of fuel, before the impact of carbon and ROC support, 
was £37.5 per MWh for the first six months of 2014, compared to £28.9 per MWh for the same period last year, 
reflecting the increase of biomass in our fuel mix. 
Biomass accounted for 23% of our total fuel burnt (by energy content) in the six months ended 30 June 2014 
compared to 7% in the corresponding period of 2013.  This increase reflects the first converted unit being 
operational for the whole period in 2014, but only part of the period in 2013, and the enhanced co-firing unit coming 
on line in May 2014. As we progress our transformation through to three converted units, biomass will continue to 
account for a greater proportion of total fuel costs.   
Within total fuel costs in respect of generation, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel burnt less the 
value of renewable support received. The cost of the fuel includes raw material and delivery costs. The renewable 
support reflects the value assigned to ROCs and LECs earned through generating electricity from burning biomass. 
The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the overall net cost of biomass.  
When renewable support is taken in to account, the average cost of fuel for the period is £27.2 per MWh (2013: 
£25.8 per MWh). 
Coal remains the largest component of our fuel mix, representing 77% of fuel burnt (by energy content) for the first 
half of 2014 (2013: 88%). As a result, the cost of the UK carbon tax introduced in April 2013 has led to a decrease 
in our achieved gross margin compared to the same period in 2013.  The carbon tax charged to the income 
statement for the 6 months ended 30 June 2014 was £49 million compared to £14 million in 2013.   
In addition to the UK carbon tax, under Phase III of the EU ETS (2013-2020) we are also required to meet the full 
cost of CO2 emitted from generation through purchases of CO2 emissions allowances in the market from the 
beginning of 2013.   
 
 
12 
 
The increase in the amount of biomass burnt in the six months ended 30 June 2014 has resulted in our CO2 
emissions reducing from approximately 10.2 million tonnes (with allowances purchased at an average price of £6.9 
per tonne) in 2013 to approximately 8.6 million tonnes (with allowances purchased at an average price of £5.2 per 
tonne) in 2014. The reduction in average price paid reflects our contracted position in the market at the point of 
purchase. 
The net impact of carbon on cost of sales is therefore an increase of £9 million when comparing the first six months 
of 2014 to the same period in 2013. 
As noted above, when it is more economical to do so, we can meet our power delivery obligations by buying power 
from the market.  In the six months ended 30 June 2014, power purchases totalled £344 million compared to £139 
million in the same period in 2013. The increase is primarily a function of the growing level of intermittent 
generation in the UK, which is providing valuable opportunities to capitalise on the flexibility of the Drax plant. 
Upon the sale of ROCs and LECs the associated income is recognised as revenue and the value of the ROC or 
LEC (previously held in the balance sheet) is recorded separately in cost of sales. The cost of ROCs and LECs 
sold in the first half of 2014 was £38 million (2013: £1 million). 
Generation cost of sales also includes grid charges of £36 million (2013: £31 million) which continue to increase, 
also driven by the impact of more intermittent generation on system balancing costs. 
 
Generation operating performance 
 
Health and safety 
Against a backdrop of significant construction activity, we have continued to deliver good safety statistics for the 
Group, with a lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate of 0.05 and 0.33 respectively for the six months 
ended 30 June 2014, compared to 0.09 and 0.23 in 2013. 
In the UK, where our safety performance is industry-leading, we have continued to undertake a significant amount 
of project work, including a single major unit outage and the modification of one of our units to run as an enhanced 
co-firing unit. 
In the US, the construction of two pellet plants and a port facility is on-going.  Safety performance at our US 
construction sites has seen some improvement, but does not yet meet the standard of our UK operations. We are 
working hard to drive improvements in this area.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biomass 
The first converted unit began to operate in May 2013, using our existing biomass co-firing materials receipt, 
storage and handling infrastructure on a temporary basis, until the new on-site systems were available later in the 
fourth quarter. As described above, a second unit was modified to operate as an enhanced co-firing unit from May 
2014. Both units have operated fully on the new bespoke systems this year. 
The first converted unit is performing very well, delivering output of 630MW on a consistent basis. The enhanced 
co-firing unit is currently going through a commissioning period and is operating in line with plan. 
The biomass forced outage rate for the period of 7.5% represents a good improvement on the comparative period 
(13.1%), reflecting our improved knowledge and understanding, with now over twelve months operating experience 
with the first converted unit. The planned outage rate for the first half of 17.4% (2013: 12.9%) includes a one month 
outage to modify the second unit for high biomass burn. 
Biomass unit availability for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was therefore 76%, similar to last year. 
The biomass load factor has shown significant improvement compared to the prior period, increasing from 57% in 
2013 to 71% this year. The load factor in 2013 reflected the challenges we faced using temporary systems, with 
only limited on-site storage available until the new systems were operational and reliability issues with coal wagons 
converted to transport biomass. As a result, operation from the first converted unit was materially constrained by 
fuel availability. These issues were largely overcome with the introduction of the new systems and bespoke rail 
wagons towards the end of 2013, resulting in a much higher load factor this year.

Coal 
We continue to achieve good operating performance from our coal units. Our planned outage rate for the coal plant 
for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was 8.3%, compared to 11.1% in 2013. Our maintenance regime includes 
a major planned outage for each of our six units once every four years.  Consequently, there is an irregular pattern 
to planned outages and associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will each undergo a major 
planned outage. One unit is undergoing a major planned outage in 2014 (2013: two units, with one complete by the 
half year end). 
The forced outage rate for our coal plant of 7.3% for the six months ended 30 June 2014 represented an 
improvement on the 7.6% for the same period in 2013, albeit slightly above our long-term target of 5%.  
Coal plant availability for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was therefore 85% (2013: 82%) reflecting good 
operational performance which continues to demonstrate our leadership position amongst UK coal-fired plant. With 
strong plant despatch economics, the resulting load factor of 82% compares favourably with the average for other 
UK coal and gas plants. 
The load factor for the plant as a whole for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was 81% compared to 77% in 
2013, reflecting an increase in electrical output (net sales) to 12.9TWh in 2014, compared with 12.6TWh in 2013.

Strategic value 
The strategic value to the Group of Haven Power, the Group’s retail business, is in providing an alternative credit-
efficient route to market for power, ROCs and LECs which enhances cash flows.  The ROCs earned through 
burning biomass in the generation business can be utilised by the retail business through sales of power.  
Renewable and Climate Change Levy exempt power sales currently account for over half of Haven Power’s sales 
and these sales utilise the LECs earned by burning biomass.  
In total, the business electricity market is c.190TWh per annum, and differs from the wholesale market in that 
collateral support is not usually required for forward power sales. In selling power into the retail market, rather than 
wholesale, the Group swaps collateral risk for credit risk, which is more controllable and is managed by assessing 
the financial strength of our customers and through rigorous credit management processes. 
 
Growth 
Haven Power is on track to deliver retail sales of between 12-15TWh by 2015 across the Industrial and Commercial 
(“I&C”) and Small and Medium Enterprises (“SME”) markets. As at July 2014, Haven Power had already contracted 
10.6TWh for the next 12 months. 
In the six months ended 30 June 2014, sales volumes rose 56% from 3.6TWh in 2013, to 5.6TWh driving an 
increase in revenue from £323 million to £513 million. 
As Haven Power continues to deliver good volume growth, movements in the financial metrics are largely driven by 
these volumes.  
 
Gross margin 
The majority of revenue growth at Haven Power has been achieved through sales to the more competitive I&C 
market which has higher available volumes and lower gross margins than in the SME market. 
The I&C and SME markets have been very competitive in both the current and prior period, which has impacted on 
margins achieved.  In addition, rising grid charges and other retail cost of sales combined to drive a gross profit of 
£7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 compared to £10 million in 2013.

Group operating and administrative expenses 
Group operating and administrative expenses before depreciation were £102 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2014 compared to £96 million in 2013, reflecting higher operating costs in the US business, where we will 
begin to commission the two pellet plants and port facility later this year, and the Front End Engineering and 
Design (“FEED”) study costs associated with our carbon capture and storage project (“CCS”).   
We remain focussed on achieving strong operational cost performance and have kept a tight control over 
inflationary cost increases in our underlying cost base. 
 
Group EBITDA 
The Group EBITDA is primarily driven by the factors influencing the gross margin described above.  
Generation EBITDA was £106 million for the period, compared to £121 million in 2013. The Retail business made a 
loss of £4 million at the EBITDA level, compared to a loss of £1 million last year. 
Therefore Group EBITDA for the first six months of 2014 was £102 million, down 15% from £120 million for the 
same period in 2013. 
Although the government has now frozen the UK carbon tax at around £18 per tonne for the period between 2016 
and 2020, the tax will continue to erode the profitability of our coal-fired generation.  This strengthens the case for 
biomass generation and supports our transformation strategy. Our financial performance must be viewed in the 
context of significant continued investment in our biomass transformation until our biomass operations reach an 
appropriate scale. 
 
 
Depreciation 
Depreciation and amortisation was £42 million for the six months ended 30 June 2014 and £29 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2013.  The year-on-year increase reflects the new biomass handling, storage and 
distribution systems at Drax Power Station, which are now approaching completion and are fully operational for the 
first two high percentage biomass units. 
The depreciation charge will continue to increase as the continued significant investment in our biomass 
transformation comes on stream.

Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 
The Group enters into forward contracts for the sale and purchase of commodities, including the sale of power and 
purchase of fuel (incorporating coal, biomass and carbon emissions allowances), in order to secure market level 
dark green and bark spreads on future sales. 
Where purchases of fuel are denominated in foreign currencies, are forecasted but not yet contracted, or have 
variable indexation elements, the Group enters into financial forward contracts to fix the future Sterling cost of 
these supplies. 
Collectively these contracts aim to de-risk the business, providing secure cash flows into the future. 
As we progress our biomass transformation strategy we have entered into an extensive hedging programme to 
support our biomass procurement activities and secure the Sterling cost of biomass. This programme covers all 
contracted and a substantial proportion of as yet un-contracted but forecast purchases and provides a significant 
degree of protection from adverse currency and indexation movements wherever possible. 
Where possible, we take the own use exemption for contracts for the purchase and sale of non-financial items 
entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements. The value of these contracts is not 
reflected in our accounts until the contracts close out and the commodity delivered. 
Other forward contracts, which meet the definition of derivatives under IFRS, are included in our accounts at their 
fair value at the balance sheet date. Fair value is derived largely by reference to observable market prices at that 
date. 
Unrealised gains and losses arise on the movements in fair value of these contracts between balance sheet dates. 
Where the contracts meet the definition of an effective hedge under IFRS, these unrealised gains and losses are 
recognised in the hedge reserve, a component of shareholders’ equity in the balance sheet. 
 
Where this definition is not met (from an accounting perspective, even though the contracts represent an economic 
hedge), the unrealised gains and losses are reflected in the income statement.

Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised through the income statement for the first six months ended 
30 June 2014 were £56 million, compared to unrealised gains in 2013 of £122 million. The movement in both 
periods was driven by the relative strength of Sterling against foreign currencies, principally the US dollar. 
A weakening US dollar during the current period resulted in unrealised losses on these contracts, as market rates 
were preferential in comparison to contracted rates. In the first half of 2013 the opposite was true, as the US dollar 
strengthened and improved the position of our contracted rates compared to the market. The volumes of these 
contracts have increased significantly during the last year as we have looked to de-risk the business by securing 
our cash flows in Sterling. 
In considering mark-to-market movements, it is important to recognise that profitability is driven by our strategy to 
deliver market level dark green or bark spreads, not by the absolute price of any single commodity at any given 
date. We therefore look to underlying profit (excluding unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts) as our 
performance indicator. 
 
16 
 
Interest 
Net finance costs for the six months ended 30 June 2014 were £15 million compared to £8 million in 2013.  
The higher charge for the first six months of 2014 reflects the additional costs associated with financing the 
investment in our biomass transformation. This includes interest on our borrowings which are described in further 
detail in the Liquidity and capital resources section below. 
 
(Loss)/profit before tax 
The loss before tax for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was £11 million compared to a profit of £206 million in 
the prior period.   
This reduction has been driven by the unrealised losses on derivative contracts in 2014 of £56 million, compared to 
unrealised gains on derivative contracts of £122 million for the same period in 2013. 
Underlying profit before tax, which excludes the effect of these items, amounted to £45 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2014 compared to £83 million in 2013.  The factors described above, including the increased cost 
of carbon, coupled with rising depreciation and finance charges, combine to drive this reduction.

The tax credit on the loss before tax for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was £4 million (2013: charge of £42 
million).   
The tax charge arising on underlying profit before tax for the six months ended 30 June 2014 of £7 million, reflects 
an average effective tax rate applicable for the period of 16%. This charge is based upon the standard rate of tax in 
the UK of 21.5%, less a small adjustment to prior year taxes.   
The comparative period reflected an effective tax rate of 20% and included a tax credit of £6 million, relating to 
research and development claims, which were agreed with HMRC in that period.    
In future years we would expect our underlying tax rates to be more closely aligned with standard corporate tax 
rates in the both the UK and US. 
 
Loss after tax and earnings per share 
Loss after tax for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was £7 million, compared to a profit of £164 million in 2013, 
resulting in basic losses per share of 2 pence in 2014 compared to earnings of 41 pence in 2013. 
Underlying profit after tax, which strips out the impact of gains or losses on derivative contracts and the associated 
tax, for the six months ended 30 June 2014 was £38 million, compared to £70 million in 2013, resulting in an 
underlying earnings per share in 2014 of 9 pence per share, compared to 17 pence in 2013.

Cash generated from operations 
Cash generated from operations was £64 million in the six months ended 30 June 2014 compared to £129 million 
in 2013.  This cash movement incorporates an £18 million reduction in EBITDA, coupled with a significant increase 
in ROC assets resulting from increased biomass generation.  As noted above, the value of our ROCs and LECs 
generated is held on the balance sheet until the assets are sold to a third party, the timing of which is driven by RO 
deadlines and commercial considerations. As a consequence, the majority of the ROCs generated in 2014 will be 
sold in 2015 at which point the cash will be realised.  This outflow was only partially mitigated by an inflow on 
carbon assets and other movements in working capital. 
Net cash flows from operating activities 
Falling profits, lower corporation tax rates and higher capital allowances arising from our capital investment have 
resulted in lower income taxes paid at £7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2014 (2013: £13 million).  2014 
taxes paid include the settlement of the 2013 liability and are shown net of £2 million of refunds in relation to 
previous years. 
Net cash used in investing activities 
Purchases of property, plant and equipment of £120 million in the six months ended 2014 (2013: £133 million) 
continue to reflect the significant amount of investment across the business as we continue to progress our 
biomass transformation.   
18 
 
Net cash flows from financing activities 
New loan facilities of £100 million were secured during the period (see Financing and cash flow management 
section).  Equity dividends paid during the period amounted to £36 million (2013: £44 million) 
Net debt/cash 
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was, therefore, £8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2014, 
compared to an increase of £68 million in 2013.  As such, net debt (after deduction of borrowings) is £38 million 
compared to net cash of £245 million in 2013.  
Financing and cash flow management 
In May 2014, we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds managed by M&G 
Investments. This complements our existing term loan facilities secured in 2012 and 2013, enhances the existing 
financing structure by providing additional liquidity to the Group and ensures a smoother profile of debt maturities. 
Furthermore, the all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive. 
 
The Group financing structure also incorporates the £75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life, 
underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, agreed last year, a 
£50 million amortising term loan from the Green Investment Bank, a £100 million amortising term loan facility with 
the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a £400 million working capital and letter of credit facility. The loans 
have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025, whilst the working capital and letter of credit facility is due 
to mature in April 2016. 
 
In addition, we have a commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity 
trades at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral. This facility continues to operate well, offering 
trading counterparties uncapped access to the security package available to our senior lenders.  
 
Overall, the financing structure is a key component of the steps we have taken over the past few years to 
restructure our business, financing and trading arrangements to enable Drax to both invest to strengthen and 
secure the potential of the business, whilst being able to operate comfortably at sub-investment grade level. 
 
In addition to the financing structure, towards the end of 2013, we completed our first ROC monetisation facility.  As 
described above, cash for ROC sales can often flow back to renewable generators some time after the associated 
power was produced.  This can result in significant working capital absorption. We agreed an £80 million facility 
with Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Limited, which allows Drax to sell ROC receivables and accelerate these 
cash flows.  
 
Capital expenditure 
Fixed asset additions were £123 million in the six months ended 30 June 2014 compared to £138 million in 2013. 
 
More broadly, we expect to spend £650 - £700 million in total (between 2011 and 2017) on progressively 
converting three generating units to biomass, together with the required supporting infrastructure and systems, 
completing the two US pellet plants and port facility and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Industrial 
Emissions Directive (“IED”). 
 
At Drax Power Station, construction work on the remaining on-site infrastructure required to support our biomass 
transformation project is continuing.  We expect this work to be complete by the end of 2014.  These systems will 
provide us with the ability to unload rail wagons efficiently, store up to 300 thousand tonnes of biomass on-site and 
deliver it direct to the combustion systems. 
 
In the US, we continue to expect commercial operations at our first pellet plant and port facility to begin in the first 
quarter of 2015, with commercial operations at the second pellet plant following on in the second quarter. We 
would expect to achieve full capacity from the pellet plants six months after commissioning. 
 
Our lead case investment for IED compliance remains unchanged, incorporating the implementation of low nitrogen 
oxide (“NOx”) burners and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (“SNCR”) technology across all units. We expect to 
invest £75 - £100 million in this project over the next four years. 
 
In addition to the biomass transformation capital expenditure, we are investing a further £90 million between 2014 
and 2016 to optimise the performance of three biomass units. This investment secures improved unit output (at 
630MW) and efficiency (at 0.5% lower than coal), with no loss of unit flexibility. Returns are strong, with payback in 
less than four years.  
 
As described in the Chief Executive’s statement, we continue to evaluate the potential for a fourth unit conversion 
and for further investment in the biomass supply chain. In particular, we have identified the opportunity to 
accelerate investment in a third US pellet plant in the US Gulf. We are also considering the possibility of a US East 
Coast pellet operation.

Other information 
 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future developments, performance and 
position including principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Chief Executive’s statement, this Operational 
and financial performance section, and the principal risks and uncertainties section which follows. Our cash flows 
and borrowing facilities are described above.  
 
We have significant headroom in our banking facilities, a recent history of cash generation, strong covenant 
compliance, and good visibility in near-term forecasts due to our hedging strategy. Our business plan, taking 
account of our capital investment plans and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, demonstrates 
that we expect to be able to operate within the level of our current banking facilities. 
 
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, and continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when 
preparing these financial statements. 
 
Seasonality of borrowing 
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the Winter period and lower despatch in the 
Summer months, when prices are lower and plant availability is affected by planned outages. 
 
Accordingly, cash flow during the Summer months is materially reduced due to the combined effect of lower prices 
and output, while maintenance expenditures are increased during this period due to major planned outages. The 
Group’s £400 million working capital and letter of credit facility assists in managing the cash low points in the cycle 
if required. 
 
Contingent liability 
We were obliged under the Community Energy Saving Programme (“CESP”) to deliver energy saving measures to 
domestic consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain during the period 1 October 2009 to 31 
December 2012. We entered into an agreement with a third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged to 
deliver our CESP obligation for a total cost of £17 million. The third party failed to comply fully with its obligation 
under the agreement, leaving a significant shortfall against our CESP obligation. Drax Power is considering legal 
proceedings for breach of contract against the third party. We entered into further agreements with additional third 
parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable. 
 
At this stage it is not possible to predict whether any enforcement action may be imposed by the Gas and 
Electricity Markets Authority. No additional provisions have been recognised in respect of this matter as we are not 
able to reliably measure what the financial impact, if any, might be.  
 
Future developments 
The key potential future developments for our business are all set out in the Chief Executive’s statement. These 
include developments in regulation (including the Renewables Obligation, Contracts for Difference and EU State 
aid) and potential future investments (in the biomass supply chain and a fourth unit conversion, which are also 
covered in Capital expenditure above) and CCS.  
 
Positions under contract 
As at 21 July 2014, the positions under contract for the sale of power 
for 2014 and 2015: 
2014

Distributions 
 
Distribution policy 
The Board has previously committed to target a pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying earnings (being profit 
attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on 
derivative contracts) in each year. Underlying earnings for the period ending 30 June 2014 were £38 million. 
 
As described in this half year report, we are transforming our business to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled 
power generator, vertically integrated through the biomass supply chain to retail sales to business customers. As 
our business model changes we will develop, in parallel, an optimal capital structure and distribution policy, aligned 
to the future of the business. 
 
Dividends paid 
On 23 April 2014, the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 23 
April 2014, to pay a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 8.9 pence per share (£36 million). The 
final dividend was subsequently paid on 14 May 2014. 
 
Dividends proposed 
On 28 July 2014, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2014 of 4.7 
pence per share (£19 million), representing 50% of underlying earnings for the period. The interim dividend will be 
paid on or before 10 October 2014 and shares will be marked ex-interim dividend on 24 September 2014. 
 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
We manage the commercial and operational risks faced by the Group in accordance with policies approved by the 
Board. The principal risks and uncertainties that could impact performance.  The nature of these risks remain 
unchanged, and are as follows: 
 
 
Commodity market price risk 
 
Counterparty risk 
 
Regulatory and political risk 
 
Power and renewables market liquidity risk 
 
Biomass market risk 
 
Plant operating risk

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
 
1. General information 
These notes provide additional detail on the disclosures within our interim financial statements. Throughout the 
notes, we have included explanations of the information presented.  
 
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company 
and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. 
The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North 
Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. 
 
2. Basis of preparation 
This section describes the accounting standards we have applied in preparing these financial statements and the 
interpretation of those accounting standards into accounting policies which are relevant to our Group. We have not 
changed any of our accounting policies in the period, nor have any new accounting standards had a material effect 
on our financial statements. 
 
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”. 
 
During 2013 the Group conducted a review of its financial statements and concluded that an alternative 
presentation of the income statement would result in more relevant information for users in accordance with IAS 1. 
 
As a result of this review, the Group now presents EBITDA as a separate line item on the face of the income 
statement. EBITDA is defined as earnings before the impact of interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and 
unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts.  
 
The information for the year ended 31 December 2013 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 
434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar 
of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not qualified, did not draw attention to any matters by 
way of emphasis and did not contain statements under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
The condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board on 28 July 2014 
 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In 2013, a number of new standards and interpretations became effective. The adoption of these standards and 
interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.  
 
Since the 2013 Annual report and accounts were published a number of new and revised standards were issued or 
became effective during the first 6 months of 2014.  
 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial information presented here are consistent with 
those followed in the preparation of the Group’s Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
 
3. Segmental reporting 
We view our operational business as two distinct areas, or segments, the generation of electricity at Drax Power 
Station (“Generation”) and the supply of power to business customers (“Retail”). The respective financial 
performance of these segments is shown here. The costs incurred by our US business, which is still in the 
development phase, are part of our Generation segment. 
 
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is 
organised into two operating segments, Generation and Retail. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable 
segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA, with sales between segments being carried out at 
arm’s length.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies which are 
described in the Group’s latest Annual report and accounts. The revenue and results of both segments are subject 
to seasonality as detailed in the Operational and financial performance review. 
 
Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made 
in the management accounts, and hence no separate asset disclosure is provided in this Half-year report. 
However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during the 
first 6 months of 2014 was £87 million (2013: £105 million), of which £61 million related to construction of assets 
within our US business. 
 
Major customers 
There were no major customers for the six months ended 30 June 2014 representing 10% or more of the Group’s 
revenue for the period (2013: £106.3 million derived from one customer). 
 
4. Taxation 
The tax (credit)/charge reflects an estimate of the corporation tax (receivable)/payable as a result of our activities 
during the period, including both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount payable on taxable profits in 
the period (which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items 
upon which we are required to pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure). Deferred tax is an 
accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences 
between the accounting and tax rules. 
 
The income tax (credit)/charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before taxation of the Group for the 
period and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the period, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement.

5. Dividends 
Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share. Our current 
dividend policy is to return 50% of underlying earnings (see note 6) to our shareholders each year. The remaining 
50% is retained for reinvestment in the future growth of the business.

On 28 July 2014, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2014 of 4.7 
pence per share (equivalent to approximately £19 million) on or before 10 October 2014. The interim dividend has 
not been included as a liability as at 30 June 2014. 
 
6. Earnings per share 
(Loss)/earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each 
ordinary share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact upon the basic EPS if all 
outstanding share options, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as 
ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS because it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends 
are calculated (note 5). Underlying EPS strips out the post-tax effect of fair value movements on derivative 
contracts from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the dividend per share for the period. 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below.

7. Derivative financial instruments 
The accounting rules for derivative contracts are complex. Where such contracts do not qualify for the own use 
exemption we account for them at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured 
in the contract, and that we could achieve in the market now, at the balance sheet date. The tables and 
commentary below provide additional detail around these values, how they are calculated and the changes in 
underlying market conditions that drive their movements. 
 
The fair values of the Group’s derivative financial instruments which are marked to market and recorded in the 
balance sheet were as follows:

As described in Operational and financial performance, contracts for the delivery of commodities are entered into to 
secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future power sales. 
Financial contracts are principally comprised of forward foreign currency exchange contracts utilised to secure 
future Sterling cash flows on commodity purchases denominated in foreign currencies. 
The fair value of commodity contracts and financial contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward 
market prices and the contract price, therefore these contracts have been grouped into Level 2 within the fair value 
hierarchy in their entirety. 
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values derived solely from unadjusted quoted prices (Level 1) or 
unobservable inputs (Level 3). There have been no transfers of any assets or liabilities between levels of the fair 
value hierarchy during the current or preceding period. 
The balance sheet position of the Group’s derivative financial instruments has improved slightly in the first half of 
2014. Falling power prices during the period have resulted in unrealised gains on forward contracts for the sale of 
power, offset by increased losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from continued strengthening 
of Sterling against foreign currencies, principally the US Dollar. 
32 
 
 
8. Other financial instruments 
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, 
payables and receivables arising from our operations. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables 
generally have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate to their fair value. The 
Group’s borrowings relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which 
approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments. 
 
9. Hedge reserve 
The hedge reserve is a component of our equity reserves. Changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts for 
purchases and sales of commodities and foreign currencies, to the extent that they qualify as effective cash flow 
hedges under accounting rules are recognised here. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as 
the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk 
as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged 
item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on 
an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly 
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.  
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge 
reserve to the extent they are effective, ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement. 
 
Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged 
transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. For 
foreign currency this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised.

Financing  
In 2014 we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds managed by M&G Investments 
which will be used for general business purposes. The placement matures between May 2019 and May 2025.  
As detailed in the Operating and financial performance, our existing facilities include a £400 million credit facility 
which matures in April 2016, term loans totalling £225 million with maturity profiles between 2016 and 2020 and a 
commodities trading line that allows trading counterparties to benefit from the security package offered to our 
senior lenders, reducing the need for us to post collateral. 
 
The new facility along with existing term loans, totalling £325 million, was fully drawn down at the half-year end.

12.  Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent upon a future event that is outside of 
our control; the payment either cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely. 
Community Energy Saving Programme  
Drax Power Limited (“Drax Power”) was obliged under the Electricity and Gas (Community Energy Saving 
Programme) Order 2009 (“CESP”) to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low 
income areas of Great Britain during the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012 (the “Obligation Period”). 
Drax Power’s obligation was to deliver 895,138 lifetime tonnes of CO2 savings. It entered into an agreement with a 
third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged to deliver its CESP obligation, for a total cost of £17 
million. The third party has failed to comply fully with its obligation under the agreement, leaving a significant 
shortfall against Drax Power’s CESP obligation. Drax Power is considering legal proceedings for breach of contract 
against the third party. 
 
Drax Power entered into further agreements with additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as 
practicable. Having taken account of the additional measures under those arrangements. the Office of Gas and 
Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”) announced in May 2013 that Drax Power had achieved 37.1% of its CESP target at 
the end of the obligation period. At the same time Ofgem also announced that it was launching an investigation into 
those companies that had failed to achieve their targets, including Drax Power. 
 
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (“the Authority”) is the enforcement authority in relation to CESP. Subject 
to the findings of Ofgem’s investigation, it will produce a statement of case or decide that there is no case to 
answer. In the case of the former, a recommendation to an enforcement committee of the Authority will be made on 
enforcement action. The Authority has wide powers of enforcement, including issuing a penalty or other means of 
enforcement. Ofgem has also indicated that a settlement committee of the Authority will be established to consider 
proposals made by obligated parties to settle investigations.  
 
Representatives of Drax Power had an initial meeting with the Ofgem enforcement team in June 2013, following 
which it received a formal information request. Drax Power is co-operating fully with the investigation and has 
provided a full response to the information request. In January and May 2014, Drax Power submitted responses to 
further information requests. Ofgem has informed Drax Power that it expects to complete its analysis of the 
evidence by the early Summer and, if it decides that there is a case to answer, to issue a statement of case or 
invitation to settle by no later than the Autumn of 2014.  As a result, it is not possible to predict accurately what, if 
any, enforcement action may be taken at this stage. 
 
In the absence of any communication on enforcement, subject to the findings of the investigation, it is not 
practicable to measure reliably the financial impact, if any. Accordingly no provision has been recognised within the 
consolidated financial statements in relation to this matter.

order to balance the system minute-by-minute. 
 
Bark spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of biomass, net of renewable support. 
 
Carbon price support mechanism (or carbon price floor or carbon tax) 
A tax upon fossil fuels (including coal) used to generate electricity. It is charged as a levy on coal delivered to the 
power station. 
 
Contracts for difference (CfD) 
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for 
generators at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will receive revenue from selling their 
electricity into the market as usual. However, when the market reference price is below the strike price they will 
also receive a top-up payment from suppliers for the additional amount. Conversely if the reference price is above 
the strike price, the generator must pay back the difference. 
 
Dark green spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of coal and carbon. 
 
EBITDA 
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment and unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts. 
 
EU ETS 
The EU Emissions Trading System is a mechanism introduced across the EU to reduce emissions of CO2; the 
scheme is capable of being extended to cover all greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
Feed-in-tariff 
A long-term contract set at a fixed level where variable payments are made to ensure the generator receives an 
agreed tariff. The Feed-in tariff payment would be made in addition to the generator’s revenues from selling in the 
market. 
 
Forced outage 
Any reduction in plant availability, excluding planned outages. 
 
Forced outage rate 
The capacity which is not available due to forced outages or restrictions expressed as a percentage of the 
maximum theoretical capacity, less planned outage capacity. 
 
Grid charges 
Includes transmission network use of system charges (“TNUoS”), balancing services use of system charges 
(“BSUoS”) and distribution use of system charges (“DUoS”). 
 
IFRSs 
International Financial Reporting Standards. 
36 
 
LECs 
Levy Exemption Certificates. Evidence of Climate Change Levy exempt electricity supplies generated from 
qualifying renewable sources. 
 
Levy control framework 
A control framework for DECC levy-funded spending intended to make sure that DECC achieves its fuel poverty, 
energy and climate change goals in a way that is consistent with economic recovery and minimising the impact on 
consumer bills. 
 
Load factor 
Net sent out generation as a percentage of maximum sales. 
 
Lost time injury rate (LTIR) 
The frequency rate is calculated on the following basis: lost time injuries/hours worked times 100,000. Lost time 
injuries are defined as occurrences where the injured party is absent from work for more than 24 hours. 
 
Net balancing mechanism 
Net volumes attributable to accepted bids and offers in the Balancing Mechanism. 
 
Net cash/(debt) 
Comprises cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments less overdrafts and borrowings net of deferred 
finance costs. 
 
Net sales 
The aggregate of net volumes attributable to bilateral contracts, power exchange trades and net balancing 
mechanism. 
 
Net sales at notional balancing point (NBP) 
Net sales at NBP is the volume of power sold to customers by our Retail business expressed at the NBP. The NBP 
reflects the volume of power sold before deduction of transmission and distribution losses incurred in transporting 
this power from the grid to the customer meter. 
 
Planned outage 
A period during which scheduled maintenance is executed according to the plan set at the outset of the year. 
 
Planned outage rate 
The capacity not available due to planned outages expressed as a percentage of the maximum theoretical 
capacity. 
 
Power exchange trades 
Power sales or purchases transacted on the APX UK power trading platform. 
 
ROCs 
A Renewables Obligation Certificate (ROC) is a certificate issued to an accredited generator for electricity 
generated from eligible renewable sources. The Renewables Obligation is currently the main support scheme for 
renewable electricity projects in the UK. 
 
Summer 
The calendar months April to September. 
 
System operator 
National Grid Electricity Transmission. Responsible for the co-ordination of electricity flows onto and over the 
transmission system, balancing generation supply and user demand. 
 
Total recordable injury rate (TRIR) 
The frequency rate is calculated on the following basis: (lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries)/hours 
worked times 100,000. 
 
UK NAP 
UK National Allocation Plan. 
 
Underlying financial measures 
We report financial measures described as “underlying” such as profit after tax and earnings per share. Underlying 
measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of gains and losses on derivative contracts and the associated tax.
