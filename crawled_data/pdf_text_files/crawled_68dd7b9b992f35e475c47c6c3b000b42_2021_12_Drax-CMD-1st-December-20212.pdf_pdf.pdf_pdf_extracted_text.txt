This presentation may contain certain statements, expectations, statistics, projections and other information that are or may be forward-looking. The accuracy 
and completeness of all such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial position, strategy, projected costs, plans, 
investments, beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc (“Drax”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), including in respect 
of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (‘Pinnacle’), together forming the enlarged business, are not warranted or guaranteed. By their nature, forward-looking 
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. Although Drax believes that 
the statements, expectations, statistics and projections and other information reflected in such statements are reasonable, they reflect the Company’s current 
view and beliefs and no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Such events and statements involve significant risks and uncertainties. Actual 
results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of 
which are beyond the control of the Group, which could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such 
forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, factors such as: future revenues being lower than expected; increasing competitive 
pressures in the industry; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting the relevant industry, both domestically and internationally, being less 
favourable than expected; change in the policy of key stakeholders, including governments or partners or failure or delay in securing the required financial, 
regulatory and political support to progress the development of Drax and its operations. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these projections or 
other forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, and we do not assume any responsibility for doing so.

“Biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of applications 
in which it can be used as a substitute for fossil-fuel based products and activities, 
from power generation to hydrogen production and even new forms of plastics. Along 
with its ability to deliver negative emissions, this makes biomass one of our most 
valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions.”

Sources of Biomass Supply
Forestry Economics Support Sustainable Sourcing
1 December 2021
Sawlogs are the primary economic driver for commercial forestry
-
Premium product for use in construction and manufacturing
-
Uneconomic for biomass and excluded from Drax sourcing policy
Biomass generation uses low-grades residuals
-
Forest sourced thinnings, branches, tops and other low-grade wood
-
Sawdust and chips from wood processing plants 
-
No alternative markets – cleared from forest, often burnt at roadside or 
left to rot releasing CO2 with no energy benefit or revenue for foresters
Commercial forest management is well regulated and controlled

UK BECCS – Benefits
Baringa study shows value of BECCS at Drax Power Station in achieving net zero 
Without early deployment of BECCS at Drax Power Station the cost to the UK of reaching net zero would be significantly higher
-
£26bn of whole system cost savings in achieving net zero by early deployment of BECCS at Drax Power Station
-
Urgent need to scale-up negative emissions alongside carbon reduction measures
BECCS also provides firm, renewable power
-
Needed to complement intermittent renewables as the power sector decarbonises
1 December 2021
Why BECCS is Carbon Negative
Sustainably sourced biomass is renewable and low carbon
59
CO2 from burning biomass is absorbed by new forest growth
Removing this CO2 creates negative emissions
Underpinned by well-established UN scientific principles
Sustainable sourcing is key
Drax has leading-edge sustainability policy,

Proximity to storage
-
Proximity to fibre baskets reduces transportation
Proximity to fibre
-
Higher capital cost vs. retrofit reflects construction of new power generation and BECCS units
Capital cost
-
Potential for lower fuel cost and wider fuel diet
-
Bottom-up design for biomass, not coal-to-biomass conversion
Fibre
-
US: targeting carbon-free grid by 2035; net zero target by 2050; long-term strategy recognises the need for 
biomass and BECCS
-
Canada: coal phase-out by 2030; net zero electricity system by 2035 and federal carbon price plan to increase 
$15/t per year from 2023 to reach $170/t by 2030
