Applicant’s Response 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.21) 
The SoS recommends that the ES 
should include a description of how 
waste generated by the proposed 
development will be dealt with. 
See Section 2.9 of the PEIR. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.21) 
The SoS also recommends that the 
potential impacts of electric and 
magnetic fields are addressed within the 
ES. 
See Section 2.10 of the PEIR. 
Public Health 
England 
(PHE) (letter 
dated 23rd 
July, page 3) 
PHE will only consider information 
contained or referenced in a separate 
section of the ES summarising the 
impact of the proposed development on 
public health: summarising risk 
assessments, proposed mitigation 
measures, and residual impacts. 
These separate sections will be 
identified in the PEIR (see Section 6.6 
and 10.6) and ES.  Consultation with 
PHE will be carried out.

Comment 
Applicant’s Response 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.43) 
The SoS would expect the ES to include 
a section that summarises the site and 
surroundings. This would identify the 
context of the proposed development, 
any relevant designations and sensitive 
receptors. This section should identify 
land that could be directly or indirectly 
affected by the proposed development 
and any auxiliary facilities, landscaping 
areas and potential off site mitigation or 
compensation schemes. 
Will be included in ES 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.44) 
The ES should include a clear 
description of the application site which 
is to be the subject of the DCO, including 
detailed land levels, existing vegetation 
species, hard surfaces and the location 
of existing buildings. The ES should 
confirm if the application site has been 
previously developed, and if so, whether 
it has been subject to any remediation 
works. 
Will be included in ES 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.46) 
The applicant should be aware however, 
that the description of the development 
in the ES must be sufficiently certain to 
meet the requirements of paragraph 17 
of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA 
Regulations and there should therefore 
be more certainty by the time the ES is 
Noted. A table will be included in the ES 
which demonstrates compliance with 
Regulations.

submitted with the DCO. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.47) 
The applicant should clearly define what 
elements of the proposed development 
are integral to the NSIP and which is 
‘associated development’ under the 
Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) or is an 
ancillary matter. 
The Power Generation Plant, Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection are all 
considered to form an integral part of 
The Project and are all considered to be 
essential to the functioning of the 
Project. Full detail will be provided in the 
explanatory memorandum which will 
accompany the draft DCO, forming part 
of the proposed application. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.49) 
The SoS recommends that the ES 
should include a clear description of all 
aspects of the proposed development, at 
the construction, operation and 
decommissioning stages, and include: 
land use requirements; site preparation; 
construction processes and methods; 
transport routes; operational 
requirements including the main 
characteristics or the production process 
and the nature and quantity of material 
used; transport routes; maintenance 
activities including any potential 
environmental impacts; emissions - 
water, air and soil pollution, noise, 
vibration, light, heat, radiation. 
Will be included in ES 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.50) 
The environmental effects of all wastes 
to be processed and removed from the 
site should be addressed. The ES will 
need to identify and describe the control 
processes and mitigation procedures for 
storing and transporting waste off site. 
All waste types should be quantified and 
classified. 
Will be included in ES 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.52) 
The ES should ensure to provide clearly 
distinguishable colours/symbols on all 
maps and figures, in order to ensure that 
specific features can be easily identified. 
Noted 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.53) 
The SoS welcomes the consideration of 
alternative technology choices included 
in the Scoping Report (paragraph 3.6.4) 
and recommends these details are 
included in the ES. In addition, the ES 
should also provide details of other 
locations considered for the Power 
Generation Plant. 
Will be included in ES 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.55) 
The SoS notes, from the comments in 
paragraph 3.3.14 of the Scoping Report, 
that the detailed design and location of 
the powerstation is still being developed. 
The applicant should make every 
attempt to narrow the range of options 
and explain clearly in the ES which

time of application, any proposed 
scheme parameters should not be so 
wide ranging as to represent effectively 
different schemes.  
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.1) 
The SoS recommends that the applicant 
provides justification for this choice of 
simple cycle gas turbine within the ES 
and directs the applicant to the 
comments of NRW indicating that this 
turbine choice is not considered to 
represent Best Available Technique 
(BAT).

Comment 
Applicant’s Response 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.55) 
The scheme parameters will need to be 
clearly defined in the draft DCO and 
therefore in the accompanying ES. It is a 
matter for the applicant, in preparing an 
ES, to consider whether it is possible to 
robustly assess a range of impacts 
resulting from a large number of 
undecided parameters. The description 
of the proposed development in the ES 
must not be so wide that it is 
insufficiently certain to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph 17 of 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA 
Regulations. 
Will be included in ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.56) 
It should be noted that if the proposed 
development changes substantially 
during the EIA process, prior to 
application submission, the applicant 
may wish to consider the need to 
request a new scoping opinion.

Comment 
Applicant’s Response 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion,

The ES should detail the proposed 
access routes for both construction and 
operational traffic. 
One route will be identified in ES but two 
options will be shown in PEIR (see 
Figure 1.1). 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion,

applicants are reminded that this 
information will be required in the ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.59) 
The SoS considers that information on 
construction including: phasing of 
programme; construction methods and 
activities associated with each phase; 
siting of construction compounds 
(including on and off site); lighting 
equipment/requirements; and number, 
movements and parking of construction 
vehicles (both HGVs and staff) should 
be clearly indicated in the ES. 
Will be included in ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.60) 
Information on the operation and 
maintenance of the proposed 
development should be included in the 
ES and should cover but not be limited 
to such matters as: the number of 
full/part-time jobs; the operational hours 
and if appropriate, shift patterns; the 
operational stage. 
Will be included in ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.2.61) 
The process and methods of 
decommissioning should be considered 
and options presented in the ES. The 
SoS encourages consideration of such 
matters in the ES. 
Will be included in ES. 
SoS (Scoping

Approach 
Organisation 
Comment 
Applicant’s Response 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.4) 
The SoS would suggest that the 
applicant ensures that appropriate 
consultation is undertaken with the 
relevant consultees in order to agree 
wherever possible the timing and 
relevance of survey work as well as the 
methodologies to be used. 
Consultation was carried out prior to the 
issue of the PEIR where required. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.5) 
The SoS recommends that the physical 
scope of the study areas should be 
identified under all the environmental 
topics and should be sufficiently robust 
in order to undertake the assessment. 
The extent of the study areas should be 
on the basis of recognised professional 
guidance, whenever such guidance is 
available. The study areas should also 
be agreed with the relevant consultees 
and, where this is not possible, this 
should be stated clearly in the ES and a

reasoned justification given. The scope 
should also cover the breadth of the 
topic area and the temporal scope, and 
these aspects should be described and 
justified. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.8) 
It is stated within the Scoping Report 
that it is not intended to include the 
operational air quality emissions of the 
gas and electrical connections as these 
sections of the proposed development 
would not produce any significant 
emissions during the operational phase 
of the development; the SoS agrees that 
these impacts can be scoped out of the 
assessment. 
Noted 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.9) 
Within the Scoping Report it is stated 
that it is not intended to include the 
operational noise or vibration impacts of 
the gas connection as this aspect of the 
proposed development would not 
produce any significant noise or vibration 
emissions during the operational phase; 
the SoS agrees that these impacts can 
be scoped out of the assessment. 
Noted 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.10) 
It is stated within the Scoping Report 
that it is not intended to include the 
operational noise impacts of the 
electrical connection as this aspect of 
the proposed development would not 
produce any significant noise emissions 
during the operational phase. The SoS 
recommends that further justification be 
provided by the applicant for scoping out 
these potential effects, the SoS draws 
the attention of the applicant to the 
comments made by NRW in this respect. 
See Section 7.2 of the PEIR. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.11) 
The SoS agrees that providing NRW 
indicates that no Water Framework 
Directive Report will be required for this 
development the provision of this report 
can be scoped out of the assessment. 
Noted 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.12) 
It is stated within the applicants scoping 
report that any impact on drainage or 
water quality caused by the gas or 
electrical connections during the 
operational and the development will be 
scoped out of the assessment, as no 
decommissioning phases of significant 
drainage or water quality impacts are 
predicted to occur as a result of the 
presence of the connections during 
these phases of the proposed 
development. The SoS recommends 
that the applicant provides further 
information regarding the potential for 
any below ground connections to form

pathways for the transport of pollutants 
which may result from previous use of 
the land. NRW noted that at least part of 
the site was previously used as landfill. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.13) 
The SoS expects that the ES should 
contain confirmation that the stacks 
required as part of the development, 
which will be up to 60m in height, will not 
be visible from the AONB. 
A further stack height sensitivity test has 
concluded that the stack will be between 
35 and 40 m in height.  The Zone of 
Theoretical Visibility confirms that the 
Power Generation Plant will not be 
visible from the AONB (see Figure 11.1). 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.15) 
In order to demonstrate that topics have 
not simply been overlooked, where 
topics are scoped out prior to 
submission of the DCO application, the 
ES should still explain the reasoning and 
justify the approach taken.

Air Quality 
Organisation 
Comment 
Applicant’s Response 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.22) 
The SoS considers that adverse change 
to air quality should be assessed in 
relation to compliance with European air 
quality limit values and any impact upon 
AQMAs. 
The assessment will make reference to 
the Swansea AQMA and the potential 
impacts of the project on the AQMA in 
the ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.23) 
Within 10 km of the site there are twenty 
SSSI’s, 1 SPA , 2 SAC’s, 1 National 
Nature Reserve and 23 SINC’s, the 
potential impacts on which should be 
carefully assessed. There is the need to 
consider potential related effects due to 
an increase in airborne pollution 
including fugitive dust especially during 
site preparation, demolition and 
construction. 
The full EIA will consider potential 
impacts on European, national and local 
designated ecological sites during 
operations through air dispersion 
modelling. Potential impacts from 
fugitive dust during site preparation, 
demolition and construction will be 
assessed qualitatively using the IAQM 
Guidance on the assessment of dust 
from demolition and construction.   
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.24) 
The ES should also include an 
assessment of potential air quality 
impacts on the Lower Lliw Reservoir as 
a result of both deposition and affected 
rainfall. 
The ES will make reference to potential 
impacts on the Lower Lliw Reservoir, 
which is an emergency reservoir.

documents, the direct impacts of 
operational and construction traffic have 
been scoped out of the assessment due 
to the low number of daily vehicle 
movements. A preliminary stack 
sensitivity assessment is presented in at 
Appendix 8.1. It will be finalised in the 
ES.   
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.27) 
The SoS recommends that the applicant 
agrees all modelling receptor locations 
with the City and County of Swansea 
and also that the applicant consults the 
City and County of Swansea regarding 
the proposed data inputs for the air 
quality model. 
The modelling receptor locations will be 
agreed with CCS. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.28) 
The SoS recommends that the applicant 
agrees which pollutants are to be 
modelled and the meteorological data to 
be used with the City and County of 
Swansea. 
The modelled pollutants will be agreed 
with CCS.  
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.29) 
There are a number of residential 
receptors within 1 km of the project site 
and suitable receptor locations for 
modelling purposes should be agreed 
with the relevant local authority and 
NRW. This may need to extend to 
densely populated areas just outside of 
the proposed study area. 
See Section 6.2 of the PEIR. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.30) 
The SoS recommends that air quality 
and dust levels are considered not only 
on site but also off site, including along 
access roads, local footpaths and other 
public rights of way. Consideration 
should also be given to appropriate 
mitigation measures and to monitoring 
dust complaints. 
The assessment of impacts during 
construction will consider impacts along 
access roads, local footpaths and other 
public right of way by applying the IAQM 
Guidance on the assessment of dust 
from demolition and construction.   
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.31) 
The SoS recommends that the applicant 
works toward submitting their 
Environmental Permit application at least 
six months prior to the submission of 
their DCO application. 
The Environmental Permit application 
will be submitted 12 months prior to the 
commencement of commercial 
operations. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.4.15) 
The SoS considers that it is a matter for 
the applicant to decide whether or not to 
submit a stand-alone Health Impact 
Assessment (HIA). However, the 
applicant should have regard to the 
responses received from the relevant 
consultees regarding health, and in 
particular to the comments from Public 
Health England in relation to emissions 
to air and the Health and Safety 
Executive in relation to electrical safety 
issues. 
The ES will consider impacts on human 
health. It is not anticipated that a stand-
alone HIA will be prepared.

NRW - letter 
dated 22nd 
July (page 3) 
The applicant is advised that particular 
attention should be given to acid and 
nutrient deposition at sensitive habitat 
receptors. 
The assessment methodology states 
that nitrogen and acid deposition at 
sensitive receptors will be considered.  
NRW - letter 
dated 22nd 
July (page 3) 
The applicant should instead use the 
APIS critical load function tool found at 
http://www.apis.ac.uk/critical-load-
function-tool, in order to calculate acid 
deposition process contributions/ 
exceedences. 
The assessment methodology describes 
the critical load function and states that it 
will be used in calculating acid 
deposition process contribution. 
NRW - letter 
dated 22nd 
July (page 3) 
The scope of the Environmental Impact 
Assessment should widen to include any 
impact upon this village (Llangyfelach) in 
addition to any cumulative impact in 
relation to air quality arising from other 
sources of pollution e.g. the M4 
motorway, the A48, B4489 and 
Morriston Crematorium 
The assessment will consider impacts 
on Llangyfelach and it will include it as a 
receptor in the air dispersion model. It is 
anticipated that emission sources such 
as the M4 Motorway, the A48, B4489 
and Morrison Crematorium will be 
reflected in the existing baseline that will 
be used in the assessment of impacts on 
the village. 
PHE - letter 
dated 23rd 
July (Page 3) 
PHE’s view is that the EIA should 
appraise and describe the measures that 
will be used to control both point source 
and fugitive emissions and demonstrate 
that standards, guideline values or 
health-based values will not be 
exceeded due to emissions from the 
installation. 
The ES will detail measures to be used 
to control stack and fugitive emissions. It 
will demonstrate compliance with air 
quality standards and permit limits 
prescribed in the IED.  
PHE - letter 
dated 23rd 
July (Page 5) 
When considering a baseline (of existing 
air quality) and in the assessment and 
future monitoring of impacts these: 
 - should include consideration of 
impacts on existing areas of poor air 
quality e.g. existing or proposed local 
authority AQMAs 
- should include modelling using 
appropriate meteorological data (i.e. 
come from the nearest suitable 
meteorological station and include a 
range of years and worst case 
conditions) 
- should include modelling taking into 
account local topography 
The ES will consider the Swansea 
AQMA. The air dispersion modelling will 
use appropriate meteorological data, 
agreed with CCS. Terrain data will be 
used in the air dispersion model.

The SoS draws attention to the 
comments of NRW regarding the 
requirements of the Environmental Noise 
Directive, and the Environmental Noise 
(Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, 
which have introduced a ‘Noise Action 
Plan for Wales.’ This covers industrial 
noise sources, impacts on designated 
Quiet Areas and the impact of creeping 
background, and should be taken into 
consideration by the applicant. 
Noted.  This Local and National Policy is 
referred to in this study, and will be 
included in the ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.34) 
The SoS recommends that information 
be provided on the types of vehicles and 
plant to be used during the construction 
phase. Noise impacts on people should 
specifically be addressed and in 
particular any potential noise disturbance 
at night and other unsocial hours such as 
weekends and public holidays. 
This will be included in the ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.36) 
The SoS recommends that the noise and 
vibration assessment takes account of 
traffic movements along access routes 
during the construction phase. 
This will be included in the ES. 
SoS (Scoping 
Opinion, 
para.3.37) 
The noise assessment should accurately 
identify the proximity of the identified 
noise sensitive receptors to the proposed 
development. With regards to the 
operational noise assessment, this 
should cover all modes of operation of 
the proposed development. 
This will be included in the ES. 
NRW – letter 
dated 22nd 
July (Page 4) 
The report does reference the BS4142 
standard in assessing noise, which 
should also consider noise 
characteristics. This being the case it is 
recommended that the company also 
capture the existing noise characteristics. 
I.e. tonal assessment/third octave 
baseline data. 
Surveys will be undertaken to capture 
this information. Already discussed with 
SCC.

In relation to the design aspects of the 
plant, we would suggest that the 
applicant designs the operation with no 
additional noise load on to background in 
line with the “Noise Action Plan for 
Wales”. Noise mitigation measures 
should also include reference to use of 
acoustic enclosures and cladding for 
plant and pipe work or ducting likely to 
produce noise under all operating 
conditions including abnormal operation. 
This will be addressed in the ES and as 
part of the detailed design.

the landfill at the location. Although this 
landfill was operated as an inert landfill, 
this is not to say that it is exclusively 
filled with inert wastes. Any disturbance, 
or excavation, reuse, temporary storage 
and disposal of this material should not 
preclude the possibility of it containing 
non-inert and potentially hazardous 
substances. An assessment of this 
element of the scheme may be 
necessary in the form of trial pits or 
boreholes in order to determine 
materials present. NRW should be made

The preliminary stack sensitivity assessment has considered a range of 
stack heights and compared impacts based on the following: 
 
maximum annual and 1 hour  ground level concentrations of NO2 at 
off-site locations to assess potential impacts on human receptors; 
and  
 
annual ground level concentration of NOX and nitrogen deposition 
at Lletty Morfil Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) 
and Ancient Woodland to assess potential impacts on ecological 
receptors. 
1.1.3 
The stack sensitivity assessment has also considered baseline levels of 
NO2 and nitrogen deposition.  
Assessment Methodology 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for the Stack Sensitivity Assessment 
1.1.4 
The realistic worst case scenario for the air dispersion modelling utilised 
the Project parameters set out in Table 1.  
1.1.5 
The ground level impact of an emission to air is determined by various 
factors including atmospheric conditions and the effective height of the 
release.  For all meteorological conditions, the higher the effective 
release height, the lower the ground level impacts.   
1.1.6 
The effective height of the release is, in turn, determined by the physical 
height of the release (the stack height), the height of nearby buildings 
and the buoyancy of the plume in providing initial plume rise before the 
exhaust gases become well mixed with the surrounding air.   
1.1.7 
The buoyancy of a plume increases with increasing temperature of the 
exhaust gases and also with increasing volume flow.  Therefore, to 
ensure a conservative (realistic worst case) assessment of impacts, the 
stack sensitivity assessment is based on a scenario employing 5 x 60MW 
generators and, furthermore, it is assumed that the plumes do not merge.   
1.1.8 
The operation of the Power Generation Plant will be limited through the 
permitting regime to 1500 hours per annum.  The assessment is, 
therefore, based on the operation of the Plant, at full load, for 1500 hours 
per annum.  Actual operational times are likely to be lower, typically 500 
hours of operation in 2 to 3 hour tranches.  As a result, the assumed 
realistic worst case scenario is considered robust.

Dispersion Modelling – Stack Parameters 
1.1.9 
The stack sensitivity assessment utilised the ADMS model (v5.0) 
developed by Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC).  
The stack parameters have been utilised in the model.  The parameters 
are based on data provided by Pratt and Witney FT4000 SWIFTPAC 
package.

1.1.10 
The only pollutants of concern in relation to gas combustion are nitrogen 
oxides (NOX) and carbon monoxide (CO).  Gas combustion does not 
generate significant quantities of particulate matter and sulphur dioxide 
emissions will be negligible since the sulphur content of natural gas from 
the NTS will be negligible. 
1.1.11 
The stack sensitivity assessment was therefore based on potential 
impacts from emissions of NOX. 
Building Downwash 
1.1.12 
The dispersion model takes into account the effects of building 
downwash1 of pollutants.  The principal buildings in terms of downwash 
are the turbine housing units.  These have been included in all model 
runs at a height of 10m (above local ground level), with a footprint of 39m 
x 16m oriented northwest-southeast.  Each stack is located at the centre 
of a turbine unit. 
Meteorological Data 
1.1.13 
The model used hourly sequential meteorological data from The 
Mumbles for five years from 2009 to 2013.  The Mumbles lies 15km to 
the south of the Project Site.  The open setting of the Project Site, with 
relatively sparse urban/light industrial development in the vicinity, is 
taken into account in the modelling by setting the surface roughness 
length to 0.2m.  This is the value recommended by the model developers 
for agricultural areas (with short vegetation).   
1.1.14 
The predominant winds are south-westerly in all years. The wind roses 
for 2009 to 2013 are provided in Appendix 6.2.   
Model Domain 
1.1.15 
The stack sensitivity assessment model domain was modelled with a grid 
with 25m resolution (2.5km x 2.5km).  This fine grid is well within the 
recommended minimum grid spacing of 1.5 times the stack height (1.5 x 
30m = 45m). 
Terrain 
1.1.16 
Terrain was included in the modelling, with data input at a resolution of 
15m over a domain of 2.5km x 2.5km.  The terrain grid resolution within 
the ADMS model was set to 64 x 64.  This grid resolution is 
recommended by Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants 
(CERC) (the developers of the model) as sufficient for most calculations 
and showed insignificant differences.   
                                                      
1 Downwash is the enhanced turbulent mixing of pollutants in the lee of buildings which can result in high pollutant 
concentrations in the wake of the building. 
 
Atmospheric Chemistry 
1.1.17 
Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) from combustion sources include 
both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO), with the majority being 
in the form of NO.  In ambient air, NO is oxidised to form NO2, and it is 
NO2 which has the more significant health impacts.  For this assessment, 
the conversion of NO to NO2 has been estimated using the worst case 
assumptions set out in Environment Agency guidance2, namely that: 
 
For the assessment of long term (annual mean) impacts, at 
receptors 70% of NOX is NO2; 
 
For the assessment of short term (hourly mean) impacts, at 
receptors 35% of NOX is NO2. 
1.1.18 
The oxidation of NO to NO2 is not, however, an instantaneous process. 
Where the maximum impacts occur within a few hundred metres of the 
stacks (as will be shown to be the case for the Project), the Environment 
Agency worst case assumptions are very conservative.   
1.1.19 
It is anticipated that a sensitivity testing of the impacts under alternative 
assumptions relating to the oxidation of NO to NO2 will be undertaken as 
part of the full assessment.  Specifically, the empirical relationship 
derived by Janssen et al3 will be considered.  The relationship is derived 
from concentrations of NOX observed in power station plumes and 
provides a lower bound on the realistic potential conversion of NO to 
NO2. 
Deposition 
1.1.20 
The deposition of nitrogen is modelled using a deposition velocity 
approach, where the surface flux of pollutants is modelled by multiplying 
the ground level concentration by a pollutant specific deposition velocity.  
The velocity used in the assessment of nitrogen deposition from nitrogen 
dioxide was 1.5mm/s for short vegetation and 3.0mm/s for tall 
vegetation4.   
1.1.21 
For the emissions from the Generating Equipment, only nitrogen 
deposition need be considered for the stack sensitivity assessment.  
Impacts due to emissions of sulphur dioxide and, by inference deposition 
of sulphur, have been scoped out of the assessment since natural gas is 
an inherently low sulphur fuel.  However, background levels of sulphur

4 Nitrogen oxide, NO, is relatively inert and insoluble and, as such, does not deposit onto surfaces as readily as nitrogen 
dioxide.  The deposition velocity approach is, therefore, applied to modelled concentrations of nitrogen dioxide only. 
deposition will are considered in the assessment of acidification as part 
of the full assessment.  
Emission Scenario 
1.1.22 
As previously stated, the Power Generation Plant will operate as a 
peaking plant, providing a maximum of 1500 hours of output over a year.  
This operating limit will be set out in the site Environmental Permit to 
operate and will not be exceeded.  As noted previously, typical operating 
hours for the plant are more likely to be of the order of 500 hours.  As a 
result, the assumed realistic worst case scenario is considered robust. 
1.1.23 
The stack sensitivity assessment takes into account this limited 
operation of the plant i.e. is based on a realistic worst case.  However, 
since it is not possible to specify which hours of the year the plant will 
operate, the method by which this is taken into account in the dispersion 
modelling is dependent on the metric being assessed i.e. annual, daily, 
eight-hour or hourly mean concentrations. 
1.1.24 
The impacts of the Project on short term (eight hours or less) pollutant 
concentrations were modelled with the assumed full load operation of all 
five generators simultaneously and continuously for a whole year.  This 
is appropriate since the UK and EU objectives and limit values for hourly 
concentrations of NO2 are based on the 18 highest and highest 
concentrations respectively over a year and, with 1500 hours of 
operation, it is near certain that operations will, at times, coincide with 
examples of the poorest dispersion conditions.   
1.1.25 
In relation to long term (annual mean) concentrations assuming full load 
operation for the year will be unrealistic.  Therefore, long term impacts 
were estimated by scaling the results for continuous full load operation 
by the likely operating time i.e. 0.171 (=1500 (maximum hours of 
operation)/8760 (total hours in a year)).  This approach is appropriate 
and is based on the assumption that the range of meteorological 
conditions under which the generators will operate will, over the 1500 
hours, be statistically similar to those experienced over a year. 
Assessment Criteria 
1.1.26 
In relation to ambient pollutant concentration, the criteria used for the 
assessment of operational impacts are the air quality objectives and limit 
values set out in Section 6.2 of the PEIR.  For deposition, no comparable 
regulated standards exist and the impacts are assessed against critical 
loads.  Critical loads are set for effects due to eutrophication (nitrogen 
deposition) and acidification (combined action of sulphur and nitrogen 
deposition).  It is reiterated that the critical loads are set at levels below 
which significant harmful effects do not occur. 
1.1.27 
The critical loads considered in the assessment of Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) sites 
were taken from the Air Pollution Information System (APIS) website, 
using the facility to extract site-specific relevant critical loads5.  The 
critical loads are shown in Table 3. To ensure that the worst case critical 
load has been considered a critical load of 5 kgN/ha/yr was also included 
as part of the preliminary stack sensitivity assessment.

Significance Criteria 
1.1.28 
The stack sensitivity assessment makes reference to the Environment 
Agency guidance (H1 Annex f) on screening of significant impacts. To 
determine the potential significance of the predicted impacts at varying 
stack heights, two parameters are presented: 
a 
the Process Contribution (PC) which is the pollutant concentration 
resulting from the contribution of the Power Generation Plant alone; 
and 
b 
the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) which is the 
background concentration plus the process contribution. 
1.1.29 
Both metrics are considered as absolute pollutant concentrations and as 
a percentage of the relevant assessment standard.  Based upon the EA’s 
H1 guidance the significance criteria for assessing impacts in the 
assessment are set out below.  
1.1.30 
The PC can be considered insignificant if: 
 
the long term process contribution is <1 per cent of the long term 
air quality standards or guidelines; 
 
the short term process contribution is <10 per cent of the short term 
air quality standards or guidelines. 
1.1.31 
The EA guidance states that detailed modelling of emissions may be 
useful when: 
                                                      
5 http://www.apis.ac.uk/srcl, data accessed 5th August 2014. 
 
the long term PEC is >70% of the relevant standard;  
 
the short term PEC >20%  of the relevant standard (assuming short 
term  background is twice the long term background). 
1.1.32 
Therefore, long and short term impacts will be considered not significant 
if PEC<70% and <20% respectively.  
1.2 
Results  
1.2.1 
Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using the emissions data 
set out in Table 2 and meteorological data from 2009-2013. Initial runs 
indicated that 2009 was the worst meteorological year for annual and 1-
hour concentrations of NO2 and 2011 for nitrogen deposition at Lletty 
Morfil SINC.  
1.2.2 
With exceedences of the critical load for nitrogen deposition in the study 
area, it was considered that an appropriate metric for determining a 
suitable stack height was that deposition over the most affected 
designated site (Lletty Morfil SINC) should not exceed 1% of the critical 
load whilst also ensuring that the annual mean NO2 PC was below 1% 
and/or the PEC is below 70% of the air quality objective. This metric was 
used to ensure impacts on human health were not significant. It should 
be noted that impacts on nitrogen deposition or NO2 concentrations 
above 1% may not necessarily be perceptible but, a numerical level is 
set for the purposes of a conservative assessment.  
1.2.3 
Table 4 and the associated figure (Insert 1) show the results of the stack 
height sensitivity testing based on an assessment of the PC.  Significant 
benefits are seen as the stack height increases from 15m to 25m, as the 
impacts of building downwash reduce.  Beyond this height, whilst 
benefits are still seen with increasing stack height, the rate of reduction 
in impacts progressively decreases.   
1.2.4 
The closest sensitive habitat is the Lletty Morfil SINC ancient woodland.  
For this APIS gives a critical load range of 10 – 20kgN/ha/yr.  However, 
to ensure a conservative assessment, a 5kgN/ha/yr critical load has also 
been applied on a precautionary basis.  
1.2.5 
By 30m, nitrogen deposition at Lletty Morfil SINC ancient woodland is 
less than 1% of the upper range critical load and by 35 m it drops below 
1% of the lower range of the critical load. At 40 m, nitrogen deposition 
falls below 1% of the 5kgN/ha/yr critical load. Any impacts arising from 
an increase in nitrogen deposition of 0.08kgN/ha/yr (35m) or 
0.05kgN/ha/yr (40m) (1.5% and 0.9% of the precautionary critical load 
respectively or 0.8% and 0.5% of the critical load for the qualifying 
habitat) will be small and imperceptible, both in isolation and in 
combination with background deposition which exceeds 28kgN/ha/yr.   
1.2.6 
Table 4 shows that annul mean NO2 concentrations falls below the 1% 
of the air quality objective at 40 m. Hourly mean NO2 concetrations fall 
below 10% of the air quaity objective at 35 m. Folowing EA guidance the 
PEC from the Power Generation Plant for ambient NO2 is also 
considered.  
1.2.7 
Table 5 and the associated figure (Insert 2) show the results of the stack 
height sensitivity testing based on an assessment of the PEC. The 
background concentrations used were based on Defra’s mapped 
background data over the Project Site, detailed in Chapter 6 of the PEIR. 
The PEC for annual mean NO2 is below 70% of the air quality objective 
at all stack heights. The PEC for the 1 hour NO2 is below 20% of the air 
quality objective at 35 m. 
1.2.8 
The preliminary stack sensitivity assessment indicates that a minimum 
stack height of 35 m will be adequate and will ensure that emissions are 
dispersed and no significant impacts on human and ecological receptors 
occur.

Summary and Conclusions 
1.3.1 
Dispersion model runs were undertaken for various stack heights 
between 15m and 45m with a model grid resolution of 25m.  The 
appropriate stack height was determined using the criteria set out in EA’s 
H1 Annex F guidance. 
1.3.2 
The preliminary stack sensitivity assessment indicates that a stack 
height of over 35 m will be sufficient in ensuring the effective dispersal of 
emissions. It is noted that this is a preliminary assessment that will be 
finalised using local meteorological data and refined modelling inputs as 
part of the ES.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Background 
1.1.1 
Parsons Brinckerhoff has been commissioned by Abergelli Power Ltd to undertake an 
assessment of ambient background noise levels at Abergelli Farm, near Swansea in 
South Wales. The purpose of the survey is to provide baseline noise information, 
which will be used to inform an Environment Impact Assessment for the proposed 
Abergelli Power Project. 
1.1.2 
A glossary of acoustics terminology is provided in Annex A. 
1.2 
Site Description 
1.2.1 
The Project Site is situated in a rural area to the south of Abergelli Farm. The site is 
surrounded by agricultural land and scattered farms in all directions, with small 
clusters of housing. To the south, at a distance of approximately 1 km, is Morriston 
General Hospital and the M4 motorway corridor.  To the west of the site, at 
approximately 300 m, is a gas compressor station and an electrical sub-station. To 
the north at approximately 1.2 km is a large water treatment plant. 
1.2.2 
Road traffic and noise from farming activities were the predominant contributors to 
environmental noise in the area.  
1.3 
Published Guidance 
1.3.1 
The methodology detailed in British Standard (BS) 7445-1:2003[2] and BS 7445-
3:1991[3], was also followed during the surveys undertaken. BS 7445 defines and 
prescribes best practice during the recording and reporting of environmental noise. 
This report details the methodology and approach of the attended noise survey and 
presents the full set of recorded measurements.   
1.3.2 
Measurements were made using Class 1 Integrating-Averaging Sound Level Meters 
as defined in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61672:2003[4].

METHODOLOGY 
2.1 
General 
2.1.1 
The noise survey was undertaken to quantify the existing noise levels at noise 
sensitive receptors surrounding the Project Site. 
Short-Term Noise Measurements 
2.1.2 
Short-term sampling measurements were conducted during the daytime, evening and 
nightime between 19/08/14 and 20/08/14 in order to capture the existing ambient 
noise level representative of that particular period. The measurement durations and 
time periods for each location were as follows: 
Daytime (0700 – 1900)  –  3 x 5 minutes 
Evening (1900 – 2300)  –  1 x 5 minutes 
Night (2300 – 0700)  –  2 x 5 minutes

2.1.3 
Noise descriptors including LAeq, LA90, LA10, LAmin and LAmax were recorded. The Fast 
time weighting was used. 
Long-Term Noise Measurements 
2.1.4 
Two continuous 24-hour long-term (LT) measurements were taken to quantify 
ambient background noise. Consecutive five-minute measurements were carried out 
continuously over a period of seven days between 19/08/14 and 26/08/14. 
2.1.5 
Two unattended sound level meters (LT1 and LT2) were set up to measure statistical 
ambient noise levels at the following locations: Abergelli Farm; and the residential 
property Maes-eglwys. 
2.1.6 
The attending site engineer was Pete Bushell (MIOA). 
2.2 
Measurement locations 
2.2.1 
The measurement locations were selected to capture free-field day, evening and 
night-time data. They were sited away from facades at a minimum of 1.2m from the 
ground. 
2.2.2 
The measurement locations used in the survey are shown in Annex B. 
2.3 
Instrumentation 
2.3.1 
Meters were calibrated and checked before and after each measurement period, with 
no change in level noted.   
2.3.2 
The calibration certificates for the meters used are provided in Annex C, which also 
shows the serial numbers of all the equipment used.   
2.4 
Weather Conditions 
2.4.1 
Weather conditions on all days were conducive to successful monitoring; with wind 
speeds between 0-2m/s. Roads were dry for the duration of the survey. The average 
ambient temperature was between 18°C and 21°C during the daytime, falling to 
around 13°C during the night-time period.

Glossary of Acoustics Terminology 
Decibel (dB) 
The decibel scale is used in relation to sound because it is a logarithmic rather 
than a linear scale.  The decibel scale compares the level of a sound relative to 
another.  The human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressures, typically 
between 2x10-5 and 200 Pa, so the logarithmic scale is used to quantify these 
levels using a more manageable range of values. 
 
Sound 
Pressure 
Level (SPL) 
The Sound Pressure Level has units of decibels, and compares the level of a 
sound to the smallest sound pressure generally perceptible by the human ear, 
or the reference pressure.  It is defined as follows: 
 
SPL (dB) = 20 Log10(P/Pref) 
where P = Sound Pressure (in Pa) 
 
 
Pref = Reference Pressure 2x10-5 Pa 
 
An SPL of 0dB suggests the Sound Pressure is equal to the reference pressure.  
This is known as the threshold of hearing. 
 
An SPL of 140dB represents the threshold of pain. 
 
A-Weighting 
The human ear can detect a wide range of frequencies, from 20Hz to 20kHz, but 
it is more sensitive to some frequencies than others.  Generally, the ear is most 
sensitive to frequencies in the range 1 to 4 kHz.  The A-weighting is a filter that 
can be applied to measured results at varying frequencies, to mimic the 
frequency response of the human ear, and therefore better represent the likely 
perceived loudness of the sound.  SPL readings with the A-weighting applied 
are represented in dB(A). 
 
L10 or LA10 
and 
other 
percentile 
measures 
This represents the SPL which is exceeded 10% of the time, expressed in dB or 
dB(A).  LA10 is used to quantify road noise levels.  Other percentiles exist and 
are used for various types of noise assessment.  These include L01, L50, L90, L99. 
Noise 
A noise can be described as an unwanted sound.  Noise can cause nuisance. 
 
Noise 
Sensitive 
Receptors (NSR's) 
Any identified receptor likely to be affected by noise.  These are generally 
human receptors, which may include residential dwellings, work places, schools, 
hospitals, and recreational spaces.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431).     
1.2 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary 
ecological appraisal, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This 
preliminary survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats.  
1.3 
The preliminary ecological survey has identified two European designated sites within 10km, five 
statutory designated sites for ecology (four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR) within 5km, and twenty-three non-statutory designated Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2km of the Survey Site boundary. Three of the 
SINCs are partially within the Survey Site boundary, and a further two are adjacent. Much of the 
woodland on the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. Direct impacts on SINCs 
and Ancient Woodland within and close to the Survey Site boundary could occur, depending on the 
final layout of the Power Generation Plant.     
1.4 
Three Section 421 habitats (‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, ‘purple moor-grass and rush 
pasture’ and ‘ponds’) are present within the Survey Site.  
1.5 
There is habitat in the Survey Site that has the potential to support European Protected Species 
(EPS) including bats, great crested newts Triturus cristatus, dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius, 
and otter Lutra lutra.  There are also habitats suitable for nationally protected species such as 
reptiles and water voles Arvicola amphibius.  Information on badgers is contained in a confidential 
version of this report. 
                                                      
1 Species referred to within The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) as species of 
principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales which are listed on the Natural Resources Wales 
website. The Welsh Assembly Government must take steps to “further the conservation” of these species under Section 
42 of the NERC ACT 2006.

Introduction 
Site Description 
2.1 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The Survey Site is contained within the red line boundary shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1and is 
centred at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is 
located approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to 
the south.   
2.2 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and areas around 
the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey 
Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional patches of 
woodland. 
2.3 
The Survey Site boundary is shown on Figures 1a and 1b (photographs of the Survey Site are 
found in Appendix 3).  
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation 
Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed 
to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal generating station to the 
existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, as well as a range of 
Phase 2 surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of 
an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, in support of the application for 
Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
BSG Ecology was commissioned to undertake a preliminary ecological appraisal of the Survey Site 
within which the Project would be located. The main aims of this report are to: 
 
Present the findings of the desk study and site surveys; and 
 
Assess the potential for the Survey Site to support protected or otherwise notable species;

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European designated 
sites was requested from within 10 km with information on national statutory designated sites was 
requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the Survey Site boundary and 
information regarding non-statutory designated sites and records of protected2 or notable species 
(particularly those identified as priority or Section 42 species and/or of local conservation 
importance or LBAP3 species) was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from 
the Survey Site boundary. Information on locally designated Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary was requested from the Swansea 
Council Ecologist. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic Information 
for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the area were 
also reviewed. 
Field Survey 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
The initial field survey was undertaken by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM 
on 24 February 2014. The Project Site boundary and therefore the Survey Site was subsequently 
extended after a design review, and a second field survey was carried out by Stephanie Boocock 
MCIEEM on 14 April 2014 of the additional area. The south-west end of the Survey Site could not 
be surveyed during the April survey, as the land here is under separate ownership and access had 
not been granted by land owners at the time of survey.  The route of the access track (that leads 
west to the B4489) was also added to the Survey Site boundary after the April survey.  Both the 
land in the south-west end and the access track were subject to a third field survey on 9 July 2014, 
carried out by Matthew Hobbs and Niall Lusby MCIEEM. Habitats within the Survey Site, and up to 
50m from the Survey Site boundary, were identified and described following standard JNCC Phase 
1 Habitat Survey methods as detailed in the Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). This 
uses a system of codes to describe different habitat types based on the dominant vegetation 
present, which are recorded by means of habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this 
report follow The New Flora of British Isles (Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
The survey was extended to give particular consideration to the potential of the habitats present to 
support protected species or species of local conservation importance; recorded as incidental 
information as part of the target notes.

It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site.  They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual.

Weather conditions during all surveys were clear and largely dry. 
Habitat Suitability Index 
3.6 
During the February field survey a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment (Oldham et al., 2000) 
of all ponds/water bodies within a 250m radius of the Survey Site (where access was possible) was 
undertaken to assess whether any of the ponds are suitable for great crested newts. No further 
details are provided in this report with full details of the methods and results of this assessment 
included in the great crested newt survey report.

Assessment of Potential Roosting Structures for Bats 
3.7 
All the trees and buildings on site were examined for their potential to support roosting bats, and 
graded according to scales provided in the Bat Conservation Trust survey guidelines (Hundt, 
2012).  No further details are provided in this report with full details of the methods and results of 
this assessment included in the great crested newt survey report. 
Limitations to Methods 
3.8 
Although records secured through the desk study and supplied by third parties provide useful 
background information for initial ecological assessment, they often comprise individual records 
supplied by members of the public or are the result of ad hoc surveys. The data trawl information 
can therefore help to inform the likelihood of a particular species being present in the area, but 
should not be relied upon to definitively determine presence or absence of individual species. 
3.9 
The first site visit was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year (February) for a survey of this type, 
being outside the main growing season, when the greatest variety of plants is in evidence.  
However the habitats on site are readily identifiable to an experienced botanist, and those that 
require further survey work in order to confirm their quality have been identified.  In addition, a 
robust assessment of the Survey Site’s potential to support protected species could also be made. 
Therefore, it is considered that the timing of the survey in this instance is not a significant constraint 
with regard to the findings of this assessment. The second survey on the 14th April was undertaken 
at a time when most plant species are evident and was less constrained in this respect. The third 
survey undertaken in July is within the optimal period for botanical survey when most species of 
plant are in leaf and many are in flower.

Designated Sites 
Statutory 
4.3 
Carmarthen Bay and the tidal estuaries that extend from it, approximately 7.2 km west of the 
Survey Site, has been afforded multiple designations and is referred to under the umbrella term 
European Marine Site (EMS4) which includes the Carmarthen Bay area and Estuaries Special Area 
of Conservation (SAC5), and the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA6). This area also 
contains a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar7). The boundaries of each of 
these sites are not contiguous but all fall within the EMS site. The details of each designation are 
provided below. There are also four statutory protected Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
and one Local Nature Reserve (LNR) within 5 km of the Survey Site. These are described in Table 
2 below.

4 The term ‘European Marine Sites’ (EMS) collectively describes Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) that are covered by tidal waters and protect some of our most important marine and coastal 
habitats and species of European importance. 
5 SACs are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive in order to conserve the 189 habitat types 
and 788 faunal species identified in Annexes I and II of the Directive (as amended).  They do not afford protection to 
birds directly (although are often subject to various other designations that do have an ornithological component and 
often offer protection to habitats of value to a range of bird species).   
6 SPAs are internationally important sites classified in accordance with Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild 
birds (commonly referred to as the Bird Directive).   
7 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

 Non-statutory 
4.5 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in Table 3 below and their locations are shown on Figure 2.  Three SINCs lie 
partially within the Survey Site boundary. Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which 
includes three fields that lie within the north-east corner of the Survey Site.  Warn Garn Wen is also 
an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the western boundary of 
the Survey Site.  Llety Morfil SINC is a collection of three areas of ancient woodland with some 
areas of marshy grassland that includes the woodland on the eastern boundary of the site and at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site.   
4.6 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary. Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent to the 
southern tip of the proposed access route.   
4.7 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland (See Figure 
2).

Habitats 
4.8 
The Survey Site is roughly an ‘L’ shape, with the majority of the Survey Site running approximately 
north-south and the foot of the ‘L’ branching off to the south-west around either side of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The topography 
drains the land to the south with the highest elevation in the Survey Site along the northern 
boundary (approximately 140m above ordnance datum (AOD). The land slopes away to the south 
and the lowest elevation is around the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 
400kV electrical substations (approximately 80m AOD).  
4.9 
The land is predominantly pastoral farmland, mostly agriculturally improved but with significant 
areas of marshy grassland. The fields are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by 
fences with occasional trees, scrub and one defunct hedgerow. There are numerous water courses 
on site, mostly in the form of ditches along field boundaries, but also four streams; one which runs 
along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site; another that runs north-west from the woodland in 
the eastern part of the site; a stream that runs through the marshy grassland to the west; and 
another around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations. There is a small woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and the land 
around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations is 
also largely wooded. There are also copses and stands of mature trees around the edges of the 
marshy grassland in the north-western part of the site, as well as along field boundaries in the 
northern part of the site. 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report

01/10/2014 
Improved grassland 
4.10 
The majority of the land on site is agriculturally improved grassland (Photo 1, 2a).  This was all 
grazed short when surveyed, and consists of abundant perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, and 
varying quantities of common grassland herbs such as white clover Trifolium repens, common 
mouse ear Cerastium fontanum, and dandelion Taraxacum fontanum agg.   
Marshy grassland 
4.11 
Areas of marshy grassland fields are located at TN2, TN11, TN23, TN33 and TN74, and all fit 
within the same Phase 1 category. The habitats in these fields vary due to stock type and grazing 
intensity.  Typically they support numerous tussocks of soft rush Juncus effusus with frequent 
sedge species.  Such as common sedge Carex.nigra and glaucous sedge C. flacca.  Other species 
noted include creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, a cinquefoil Potentilla sp., creeping buttercup 
Ranunculus repens and sharp-flowered and/or jointed rush Juncus actutiflorus / J. articulatus.  
4.12 
The northernmost field at TN2 (Photo 3) was grazed extremely short, when surveyed, to the point 
where individual species are difficult to distinguish.  Soft rush is frequent, along with purple-moor 
grass Molinia caerulea, sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and a sedge species (not possible to identify 
to species level).  Heather Calluna vulgaris and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus plants are occasional 
and there are patches of sphagnum moss Sphagnum sp. present. 
4.13 
The fields marked TN27 and TN18, are wet semi-improved grassland, with marshy species such as 
lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula, sedges, soft rush and water figwort Scrophularia aquatica. 
4.14 
The fields marked TN2 and TN74 all have over 25% soft rush which places them in the ‘marshy 
grassland’ category, but the intervening grassland is agriculturally improved, with abundant 
perennial rye-grass and frequent white clover.  The fields marked TN74 (Photo 4) have a much 
higher cover of soft rush - ranging from 75% to 100% in with the intervening species are more 
typical of wet grassland, such as creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, creeping buttercup and 
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus.   
4.15 
Areas of purple-moor grass dominated vegetation, which also falls into the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category are present at TN11 (Photo 5), TN23 and TN33 where the purple moor grass is dominant 
with very occasional cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather plants in evidence and scattered 
willow Salix sp. scrub. At TN23 additional species recorded include soft rush, bracken, common 
haircap moss Polytrichum commune, unidentified sphagnum moss, heather, cross-leaved heath 
and bilberry along the margins with some birch and willow regeneration in small scattered copses. 
TN33 (Photo 4a) is a large field which is superficially similar to that at TN23 but appears to have 
been managed.   Purple moor-grass is not as dominant with numerous patches of bare earth and 
young ling and cross-leaved heath plants.  In addition hare’s-tail cotton grass Eriphorum 
vaginatum, (Photo 1a) deergrass Trichophorum germanicum and lousewort Pedicularis sp. are 
common. 
Semi-improved Grassland 
4.16 
The field to the south of the woodland at TN7 appears to be slightly less agriculturally improved, 
having a lower cover of perennial rye-grass, and a wider range of grasses such as Yorkshire fog, 
crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus and creeping and common bent Agrostis capillaris.  The field 
is nevertheless species-poor. There are also several other species-poor semi-improved fields in the 
Study Site (TN27 (Photo 3a) and TN73). 
Woodland and scrub 
4.17 
There is a block of broadleaved woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site at TN7.  
The western end is on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground 
flora including species such as Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear and creeping buttercup.  The 
trees here are small to medium-stemmed with very little understory, and include birch Betula 
pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur.  
The hill slopes down steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of 
woodland.  Here the tree species composition is similar but the understorey is much thicker with 
bramble predominating.  On wetter areas, where the bramble thins out, carpets of opposite-leaved 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report

01/10/2014 
golden-saxifrage Chrysosplenium oppositifolium are present.  There are also extensive areas of 
purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with sphagnum moss species also present. 
4.18 
To the north of this woodland there is a thin strip of deciduous woodland running along the banks of 
a stream running north to south at TN48. The species composition includes occasional birch, 
willow, ash and holly. There is an understory made up largely of gorse with bramble scrub and soft 
rush grading into improved grassland to the east.   
4.19 
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland is present at the south-west end of the 
Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations.  This forms a strip to the south and a more continuous block to the north of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The woodland is 
generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow species frequent along with pedunculate 
oak, birch and holly.  The trees are growing close together and are generally small-stemmed and 
straggly.  The understorey is dense bramble and ground flora was largely absent when surveyed, 
although where the woodland opens out, for example around the margins of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations, soft-rush dominated 
marshy grassland is present. 
4.20 
There are also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the 
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site. At TN20 there is a small 
wooded spur with tree species including oak, birch, holly, hawthorn and an understorey dominated 
by brambles and including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent, Yorkshire fog, soft rush, hard fern 
Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern Dryopteris affinis, and bracken Pteridium aquilinum.  At TN35 
there is a wooded copse with young birch and willow and an understorey of bramble scrub.  The 
ground flora incudes nettle, lady fern Athyrium filix-femina, scaly male fern Dryopteris affinis and 
wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum. A continuous area of scrub is present to the south of 
the woodland at TN7 and around the pond at TN12.  These areas are quite wet and include willow 
species (including grey and goat willow Salix cinerea, S. caprea), alder and bramble.  At TN12 the 
scrub merges into stands of purple moor grass that are present around the pond. There are also 
blocks of scrub to the south of Abergelli Farm, along the stream that runs along the eastern 
boundary, at the northernmost point of the Survey Site, and within the marshy grassland to the 
west.  Scattered scrub (mostly common gorse Ulex europaeus) is present along some fence lines, 
and there is a bramble scrub-covered bund at TN3.   
4.21 
Many of the trees within the Survey Site are along site boundaries and are remnant hedgerow 
stools, as described in the section below. 
Boundary features 
4.22 
All boundaries within the Study Site are fences, except one length of species-poor hedgerow 
running north of Abergelli Farm and a second running along the northern side of the access track at 
TN58.  The fences often run along the line of defunct hedges (Photo 1).  These generally take the 
form of a degraded stone-faced hedge banks, with occasional small sections of overgrown hedge.  
The overgrown hedges include mature standard trees, large coppice stools and clumps of bramble 
and gorse scrub.  Species present include pedunculate oak, holly, birch, ash Fraxinus excelsior, 
hazel Corylus avellana and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. 
4.23 
Some of the fields on site have overgrown margins where the vegetation is less trampled and 
grazed along the fence line.  For example the improved fields along the northern boundary of the 
Study Site have ditches lined with purple moor-grass and gorse, and further east along this 
boundary bracken is frequent.  The western boundary of the field marked TN74 has purple moor-
grass and heather growing along the fence.   
Water Courses 
4.24 
There are numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These are mostly ditches along 
field boundaries (T43, Photo 5a), but there is also some larger streams. The block of marshy 
grassland to the north-west is criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with 
marshy bases when visited in April.  There is also a stream that runs through this block of land – 
this is shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks.  Another stream (Photos 
8, 9 and 6a) runs south-east through the Survey Site and splits into smaller tributaries through the 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report

01/10/2014 
woodland at TN7. There are also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations.  All features that were 
visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet weather preceding the 
survey. Aquatic vegetation is not apparent in any of the water courses, but marginal vegetation 
includes frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse and bramble.   
Water Bodies 
4.25 
There are four water bodies within the Survey Site. The pond at TN12 is approximately 10m in 
diameter, shallow, and completely covered in an unidentified sedge species.  It has a small tree-
covered island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small willow and alder trees.  The surrounding 
vegetation is dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional heather and cross-leaved heath 
plants, with densely growing small trees and scrub (grey willow, bramble and alder).  A small pond 
immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This was not apparent amongst the scrub, but 
there were small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within purple moor grass in this 
area. 
4.26 
A small pond is present at TN15 and is adjacent to an electricity pylon.  The pond is approximately 
circular and 5m in diameter.  It is in woodland and completely surrounded by small saplings.  There 
was no evidence of marginal or emergent aquatic vegetation when surveyed. 
4.27 
Two ponds are also present immediately to the south-west of TN41.  The easternmost is 
approximately 10m in diameter, open and unshaded with both aquatic and marginal vegetation 
present.  It appears to be an extension of two field drains that meet at this point.  Pond 11 is a 
small wet depression containing no vegetation. 
Invasive Species 
4.28 
Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica was noted on at least two locations on the block of land to 
the west of the road that runs through the site.  At TN29 several stands of the species were noted 
on an embankment to a large raised area.  At TN30 a stand of the species was noted on a bend in 
the stream. There are also several stands of this species growing on the edge of the road that 
leads into Abergelli Farm from the west. These extend just beyond the western site boundary and 
into the Survey Site. 
4.29 
Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera was also noted in two areas.  Abundant seedlings of the 
species were noted in the wooded copse at TN34 and on an area of deciduous woodland at TN39.  
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
4.30 
This section presents the protected species records provided by SEWBReC along with any 
evidence of the species, or potential for it to be present gathered during the field survey.  Where 
relevant it also evaluates the potential for the Survey Site to support Section 42 species identified 
within the desk study area.  The legislation and policy relevant to each species or species group is 
described in Appendix 5. 
Bats 
4.31 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site in the records’ approximately 1 km to the 
south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.32 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule Nyctalus noctula, 
and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. There were also unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and records 
where the bat species was not specified. 
4.33 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87

whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.   
4.34 
Details of surveys carried out for roosting bats are contained within the bat survey report.   
4.35 
The northern end of the Survey Site offers limited foraging and commuting potential for bats.  The 
boundaries are fences and short sections of remnant hedgerows and the fields are closely grazed.  
The block of marshy grassland, woodland and scrub to the west of the road that runs through the 
Survey Site, and the wooded stream that runs along the eastern boundary offer more potential, and 
both areas have good wooded connections with a network of hedgerows, tree-lines and marshy 
pastures off-site.  The damp wooded area around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electrical substations at the south-west end of the Survey Site also offers 
foraging potential and connects to off-site blocks of woodland to the north and south that may be 
good habitat for bats. 
4.36 
It is concluded that the Survey Site offers moderate habitat quality for foraging and commuting 
bats.  There are potential roosting opportunities in some buildings and trees (see the bat survey 
report for full details), and some areas (woodland and marshy grassland) of the Survey Site which 
offer foraging opportunities, but the Survey Site as a whole does not have good linear commuting 
features and the majority of the habitats (tightly grazed improved grassland) are of low foraging 
value. 
Great crested newt  
4.37 
There were no records for great crested newts provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey 
Site. 
4.38 
Details of the results of the HSI survey are given in the great crested newt survey report. 
Dormouse 
4.39 
SEWBReC did not provide any records of dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius. The woodland 
areas on the eastern boundary, at the south-west end and within the marshy grassland in the 
north-west of the Survey Site do not provide optimum dormouse habitat although they are suitable 
for the species. Most of the woodland consists of relatively immature trees with little hazel 
understorey, limited foraging opportunities for this species and a lack of connectivity in the canopy. 
However, these areas of woodland have good connections to a complex of woodland and thick 
hedgerows to the west, south and east, and consequently could potentially form part of a wider 
network of dormouse-supporting habitat. There are a number of recent examples of dormouse 
occurring in sub-optimal habitat, such as coniferous plantation and species-poor hedges, in south 
and mid-Wales and their presence should not be ruled out if the habitat is sub-optimal but still has 
clear potential to support the species, as in this case. 
Otter 
4.40 
SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 
and 2013. The closest record to the Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west from the River Llan.  At 
its closest point the River Llan is approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, 
and it links to the Survey Site via the stream running through the woodland in the centre of the 
Survey Site.   
4.41 
There are a number of water courses on site, most of which are ditches, but also a small stream 
running from north-west to south-east along the centre and eastern flank of the Survey Site and 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  None of the water courses on site are likely 
to provide good foraging opportunities because of their size, but they may offer lying up sites for 
otter, and it is possible that individuals might use the water courses to commute along from time to 
time.

Water Vole 
4.42 
SEWBReC provided three records of water vole from the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the 
Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River is hydrologically linked to the Survey Site (see 
otter section above), so it is possible, if any of the water courses retain water, particularly those 
linked to the River Llan, that water voles could be present on site. 
4.43 
No evidence of water voles was noted along the water courses on site when surveyed in February 
and April, although February is a time of low activity for the species, when field signs may not be 
evident.  The water courses that were visited in February all had flowing water in them when 
surveyed, following a prolonged period of extremely wet weather during the winter.  It is likely that 
many of these are usually dry or hold only a small amount of water and this was confirmed during 
the April survey. As such they do not provide good habitat for water voles. The stream that runs 
along the eastern boundary of the site; however, does provide suitable habitat for water vole, 
particularly at TN47-49. At TN49, a number of vole tunnels and holes were seen along the western 
side of the bank in long tussocks of grass, although it was not possible to ascertain which species 
had made them.   
Reptiles 
4.44 
There were 12 records of reptiles provided by SEWBReC, between 1998 and 2010. These 
included records of all the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara, and slow worm Anguis fragilis. The closest record is of a common 
lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the 
south-west side of tinplate workings near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the 
southwest of the Survey Site boundary. 
4.45 
There are several areas of the Survey Site that provide suitable habitat for common reptile species.  
This includes areas of marshy grassland to the south of the Survey Site, mounds of wood to the 
south of the woodland at TN7 (Photo 11), scrubby woodland fringes (Photo 12) and overgrown field 
margins either along remnant hedge banks or ditch banks. In addition a common lizard was seen 
during the April Phase 1 survey in the marshy grassland area in the north-west of the site and this 
area is particularly suitable for reptiles providing high quality habitat for foraging, sheltering and 
basking. 
Badger 
4.46 
Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
Birds 
4.47 
During the Phase 1 survey a number of common woodland and farmland bird species were 
recorded and these are listed in Appendix 4. The trees and woodland on site may provide nesting 
habitat for a range of common bird species.  The marshy grassland on site could also provide 
nesting habitat for ground-nesting bird species. The Survey Site does not appear to be of particular 
importance for wintering birds with no notable aggregations of common species or any rarer 
species recorded during the walkover survey, except for a red kite Milvus milvus seen in flight over 
the Survey Site (see below) in both February and April.  
4.48 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata, northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus and 
skylark Alauda arvensis. The closest of these records are located at the tinplate workings site near 
to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site boundary.  There 
was one record of curlew, located at the Lliw reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
 
Schedule 1 Birds 
4.49 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl Tyto alba. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the 
west of the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south 
west near Penllergaer Woods in 2000.  It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the 
Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, although no trees were found that appear, from a 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report 
 
18 
01/10/2014 
ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large cavities to support nesting barn owls. Full details 
of tree and buildings surveys are included in the bat survey report.  
4.50 
The marshy fields at the southern end of the Survey Site, although probably sub-optimal, could 
provide habitat for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) given the thick, tussocky 
structure of some parts of the sward. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site 
provides optimal foraging habitat for barn owls due to its extensive areas of tussocky grassland that 
may support breeding field voles Microtus agrestis, their preferred prey species. 
4.51 
A red kite was noted circling above a field in the north of the Survey Site and also over Abergelli 
Farm during the February survey.  Red kites generally breed in valley woodlands of which there is 
extensive habitat to 2-3 km to the east and west of the Survey Site.  It is considered likely that the 
Survey Site is part of a much wider area of potential foraging habitat for the species. SEWBReC 
provided 54 records for red kite between 1999 and 2013. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 terrestrial invertebrate species. The species 
recorded are marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth 
Hemaris tityus, and small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty-nine of the records are of 
marsh fritillary; the closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site 
boundary in 2009. This location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well 
as the closest of the five small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee 
hawk-moth record. 
4.2 
The marshy grassland to the west provides suitable habitat for marsh fritillaries, although the food 
plant devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis was not noted in any quantity during the April survey.  
Of the other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for 
narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus, which largely relies on devil’s bit scabious, like 
marsh fritillary. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers to 
bask and no areas where its usual food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is found in any 
quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola spp.) as its food plant and violets 
have not been recorded during either Phase 1 survey (the April survey was well timed to record 
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species is present.  
4.3 
Other habitats that may be suitable for diverse assemblages of terrestrial invertebrates include the 
areas of broad-leaved ancient woodland at TN7, for example, which represents a fairly extensive 
area of semi-natural habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates, particularly 
Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera); which are both strongly represented in 
wooded habitats.   
Aquatic Invertebrates 
4.4 
No records of Section 42 aquatic invertebrate species were provided by SEWBReC, and it is 
unlikely that any of the ponds on or close to the site support unusual or diverse assemblages of 
aquatic invertebrates.

Appendix 2: Target Notes 
1. Wet ditches, typically spring fed, one with ochre discolouration.  With steep banks dominated by sweet-
grass Glyceria sp. and soft rush Juncus effusius, with great willow herb Epilobium hirsutum present 
occasionally.  Frog spawn was present in one of the ditches. 
2. Marshy grassland with abundant to dominant soft rush.   Sward height varies depending on stock grazing 
type and intensity.  Sedge species frequently occur, including common sedge Carex nigra and glaucous 
sedge Carex flacca.  Other species noted include sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and/or jointed rush 
Juncus articulatus (difficult to separate in winter and when closely grazed), cinquefoil species (Potentilla sp.), 
daisy Bellis perennis and creeping bent Agrostis capillaris.  In between the rushes, agriculturally improved 
and semi-improved grassland is present  with perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, common mouse-ear and 
white clover Trifolium repens dominating in the improved fields, with Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, creeping 
buttercup Ranunculus repens, silverweed Potentilla anserina, dandelion Taraxacum officinale agg., ribwort 
plantain Plantago lanceolata, lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula, mouse-ear-hawkweed Pilosella 
officinarum and unidentified sedges Carex spp. occurring. 
3. A small concrete bunker with wasteland area.  The concrete bunker is formed of 2m high brick walls with a 
flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south elevation and a 30cm x 
30cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  No evidence of bats was recorded. The surrounding land is 
compacted course aggregate which is becoming colonised with common grassland species.  There is an 
earth bund around the south-east and north-east boundary, topped with dense bramble and gorse scrub. 
4. An area of marshy grassland which is very closely grazed.  Occasional common heather Calluna vulgaris 
and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus plants and patches of sphagnum moss Sphagnum sp. were recorded. 
Purple moor grass Molinia caerulea is frequent and forms dominant tussocks at the north end of the field.  
Other species include sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and a sedge species.   
5. A derelict stone farmhouse with only the bottom halves of walls still present.  Patches of rubble, a number 
of mature / dead ash Fraxinus excelsior trees and overgrown vegetation are present, which may provide 
good habitat for reptiles and bats. 
6. A stream lined with trees, which is fast-flowing with a stony substrate. 
7. An area of broadleaved woodland.  The western end is on a hill, which slopes steeply down to the east.  
This end (delineated by a stream running north-south) is dry with widely spaced trees and a grazed 
grassland ground flora (Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear, and creeping buttercup were the most prominent 
species) and very little understorey was noted.  The eastern end is much wetter, with carpets of opposite-
leaved golden-saxifrage Chrysosplenium oppositifolium, extensive areas of purple moor-grass dominated 
ground flora with some sphagnum moss species.  The understorey is thicker here and is predominantly 
bramble Rubus fruticosus.   Tree species include birch Betula pubescens, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly 
Ilex aquifolium and English oak Quercus robur.  Most specimens are small-medium in size. 
8, 9.and 24. These Target Notes relate to evidence of badger activity and are provided in a confidential 
version of this report. They are also omitted from Figures. 
10. A ditch along a line of small-medium trees (beech Fagus sylvatica, holly, English oak) and a fence. 
Bilberry is growing along the fence. 
11. A marshy grassland field with abundant soft rush tussocks.  The area indicated by this target note is 
dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and scattered small 
trees/scrub.  
12. A shallow pond (less than 10cm deep), approximately 10m in diameter, completely covered in a sedge 
species (only dead leaves were evident so identification was not possible) and with a small tree-covered 
island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small trees.  The surrounding vegetation includes purple moor-
grass with occasional common heather and cross-leaved heath and densely growing small trees and scrub 
(willow species Salix sp., bramble and alder Alnus glutinosa.  A small pond immediately to the south is 
shown on OS maps.  This consisted of small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within marshy 
(rushes, purple moor grass) vegetation. 
13.  A strip of land around the gas station, which is higher than the surrounding land.  There is a gravel strip 
immediately surrounding the boundary fence then a steep slope covered in soft-rush dominated grassland.  
At the base of the slope is a mosaic of marshy rush-dominated grassland with dense bramble scrub and wet 
woodland.  The woodland consists of closely spaced, small and straggly trees composed largely of holly, 
English oak, birch, willow and alder.

14.  An area of wet woodland with dense bramble understorey.  The species present and structure are as for 
Target Note 13.  Wet underfoot. 
15. A small pond within woodland fed by a stream.  No emergent/marginal vegetation was in evidence and 
the pond is surrounded by small saplings. 
16. Improved grassland with short sward grazed by horses. Access to field restricted by presence of horses. 
Species observed from track include creeping thistle Cirsium arvense, perennial rye-grass, broad-leaved 
dock Rumex obtusifolius and creeping bent. 
17. 
Species-poor hedge with hawthorn Crataegus monogyna and willow, grading into old bank boundary 
with overgrown hedge with oak Quercus sp. and holly and drainage ditch along north side.  
18. 
Marshy grassland with small copse of willow, oak and birch Betula sp., fenced off from horses with 
head of spring in centre. Potential for terrestrial phase amphibians and reptiles in sunny hedgebank and 
refugia provided by piles of dead wood and nesting birds in trees.  Species recorded include common bent, 
Yorkshire fog, soft rush, creeping bent, sweet grass Glyceria sp., wavy bittercress Cardamine flexuosa, 
creeping buttercup, curled dock Rumex crispus, broad-leaved willowherb Epilobium montanum, bird’s-foot-

Appendix 5: Summaries of Relevant Legislation, Policy and Other 
Instruments 
National Planning Policy  
5.1 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 5 provides Welsh Assembly Government advice about how the land 
use planning system in Wales should contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and 
geological conservation.   
5.2 
It follows that the TAN provides guidance to local planning authorities on: the key principles of 
positive planning for nature conservation; nature conservation and Local Development Plans; 
nature conservation in development management procedures; development affecting protected 
internationally and nationally designated sites and habitats; and, development affecting protected 
and priority habitats and species. 
5.3 
Planning considerations with regard to habitats and species are of greatest relevance to the 
Abergelli Farm proposal.  For a full account, the TAN should be referred to, but some of the key 
principles are summarised as follows: 
i. 
When dealing with cases where a European protected species of plant or animal may be affected, 
a local planning authority needs to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive in the 
exercise of its functions. 
ii. 
The TAN refers to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which makes it an offence 
(with certain limited exceptions and in the absence of a licence) to intentionally to kill, injure or take 
any wild bird, or to damage, take or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is being built or 
in use, or to take or destroy its eggs.  Further offences apply to species listed under Schedule 1 of 
the Act. 
iii. 
The above Act also affords protection to wild animals of the species listed in Schedule 5, and to 
wild plants listed in Schedule 8, most of which are not European protected species.  Actions that 
are likely to result in an offence are identified; 
iv. 
With regard to badger, Meles meles, the TAN refers to the provisions of the Protection of Badgers 
Act, 1992; 
v. 
The TAN makes reference to Sections 40 and 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006, which place a duty on the Welsh Assembly Government to have regard to 
the purpose of conserving biodiversity (see Section 1.10 of this report); 
vi. 
In section 2.4 it is noted that when deciding planning applications that may affect nature 
conservation, local planning authorities should protect wildlife and natural features in the wider 
environment, with appropriate weight attached to priority habitats and species in Biodiversity Action 
Plans; 
vii. 
When determining planning applications, planning authorities should ensure that all material 
considerations are taken into account, that decisions are informed by adequate information about 
the potential effects of development on nature conservation, and that the range and population of 
protected species is sustained; 
viii. 
Planning applications should demonstrate a step-wise approach to avoid harm to nature 
conservation, minimise unavoidable harm by mitigation measures, offset residual harm by 
compensation measures and look for new opportunities to enhance nature conservation. 
UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework 
5.4 
The Environment Departments of all four governments in the UK work together through the Four 
Countries Biodiversity Group.  Together they have agreed, and Ministers have signed, a framework 
of priorities for UK-level work for the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Published on 17 July 
2012, the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework' covers the period from 2011 to 2020.  
 
Abergelli Power Project – Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report

01/10/2014 
5.5 
Most work which was previously carried out under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) is now 
focussed in the four countries of the UK through the new framework.  The UK BAP partnership no 
longer operates but includes detailed Action Plans for priority habitats and species, which are still in 
use and of relevance. The list of priority habitats and species included within the UK BAP list is 
equivalent to the list of Section 42 habitats and species.  
5.6 
The UK BAP is supported by a series of Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAPs), usually set up on 
a local authority administrative boundary basis. Each LBAP identifies those habitats and species 
considered to be most important in that area (usually referred to as priority habitats and species). 
Commonly, an LBAP will identify a number of habitats and species for which “action plans” have 
been prepared. The Swansea LBAP is was created in 2005 but is unavailable as it is under review. 
Wildlife Legislation 
5.7 
Legislation of most relevance to this assessment includes the following: 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006  
5.8 
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty 
which public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public 
authority must, in exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper 
exercise of those functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority 
includes local authorities and local planning authorities. 
5.9 
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living 
organism or type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”. 
5.10 
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the 
living organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal 
importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list 
that was found in Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act). 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way 
Act 2000) 
Protection afforded to birds 
5.11 
Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) prohibits the intentional killing, injuring or 
taking of any wild bird and the taking, damaging or destroying of the nest (whilst being built or in 
use) or eggs.  Section 1 also prohibits disturbing any bird listed on Schedule 1 of the Act whilst at 
or near the nest and prohibits disturbing the dependent young of such birds. 
Protection afforded to other animals 
5.12 
Species listed on Schedule 5 that may be of relevance to this site include GCNs, bats, otter, water 
vole and all species of reptiles.  The places of shelter used by otter and water vole are protected, 
but reptiles are protected from killing and injury only. 
Protection afforded to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
5.13 
Section 28 allows for the creation of SSSIs by the government (through Natural Resources Wales 
in Wales) where Natural Resources Wales (NRW) “is of the opinion that any area of land is of 
special interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features.” 
5.14 
Section 28G specifies the duty of specific public authorities (including local authorities) to further 
the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is designated and 
also to notify NRW of operations likely to damage such features in order that NRW may consent to 
or refuse permission for such operations.

The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
5.15 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species (Amendment) Regulations 2012 consolidates the 
various amendments that have been made to the Regulations. The original (1994) Regulations 
transposed the EC Habitats Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) into national law. 
5.16 
“European protected species” (EPS) are those which are present on Schedule 2 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. They are subject to the provisions of 
Regulation 41 of those Regulations. All EPS are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended). Taken together, these pieces of legislation make it an offence to: 
a) Intentionally or deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal included amongst these 
species; 
b) Possess or control any live or dead specimens or any part of, or anything derived from a these 
species; 
c) Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species; 
d) Deliberately take or destroy the eggs of such an animal; or 
e) Intentionally, deliberately or recklessly damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of 
such an animal, or obstruct access to such a place. 
5.17 
For the purposes of paragraph (c), disturbance of animals includes in particular any disturbance 
which is likely— 
a) to impair their ability— 
I. 
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
II. 
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or migrate; or 
5.18 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which they belong. 
5.19 
Although the law provides strict protection to these species, it also allows this protection to be set 
aside (derogated) through the issuing of licences. The licences in England are currently determined 
by NE for development works. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulations (2012), a 
licence can only be issued where the following requirements are satisfied: 
a) The proposal is necessary ‘to preserve public health or public safety or other imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature and 
beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment’; 
b) ‘There is no satisfactory alternative’; and 
c) The proposals ‘will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species 
concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range’. 
5.20 
EPS that may be relevant to this proposal include GCNs, bats, dormouse and otter. 
Invasive Species Legislation 
5.21 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are both listed on Part 2, Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  Section 14 of the Act states that it is an offence for a 
person to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any species listed on Part2, Schedule 9.  The 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 contains a number of legal provisions concerning ‘controlled 
waste’.  Any soil or plant material contaminated with Japanese knotweed that is to be discarded is 
classified as controlled waste.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified records of otter Lutra lutra and water vole Arvicola 
amphibius within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey 
Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey of streams 
and wet ditches within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 
within the Survey Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Project. 
1.3 
All accessible ponds, streams and wet ditches within the Survey Site boundary were surveyed for 
field signs of use by otter and water vole. 
1.4 
There are water courses on Survey Site that could provide resting places and commuting routes for 
otter. A single fresh spraint was recorded during the survey. This was observed on a rock in the 
stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site. 
1.5 
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were observed at six points along two streams 
within the Survey Site. The holes have the right dimensions to allow use by water voles, but did not 
show signs of current occupation. No latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed during the 
survey.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey 
in May/June 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
2.4 
There are a number of water courses within the Survey Site as described below: 
 
A stream corridor with small tributaries fed by springs and surface runoff along the 
eastern boundary of the Survey Site, which feeds into the River Llan to the south.  
 
A wooded stream runs along the north western boundary.  
 
Several small streams and wet ditches run through the woodland surrounding the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations. 
 
Drainage ditches border many of the pasture fields. 
Description of Project 
2.5 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.6 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including an otter and water vole survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in 
support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.7 
The aims of the otter and water vole survey within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Assess where water courses within the Survey Site have the potential to support otter and 
water vole. 
 
Establish the likely presence/absence of each species and, if present, their distribution 
throughout the relevant watercourses.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected2 species, including otter and water vole, was requested covering the Survey 
Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area was also reviewed in May 2014 to identify watercourses that might be 
present within the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
A Phase 1 habitat survey was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated in April 
and July 20143. During the Phase 1 habitat survey it was noted that a number of watercourses 
within the Survey Site had the potential to support otter and water vole, although no field signs 
were observed. The ponds within the Survey Site were also assessed at this time, and no field 
signs of otter or water vole were noted. 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The otter and water vole survey included two visits to cover water courses within the Survey Site. 
The first visit covered the north of the Survey Site and was conducted on 20 May 2014 by Anna 
Gundrey MCIEEM and Rachel Taylor ACIEEM. The second visit covered the south of the Survey 
Site and was conducted on 26 June 2014 by Rachel Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. All 
accessible water courses were inspected for field signs of otter and water vole. In addition, Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann surveyed the ponds within the Survey Site while undertaking 
great crested newt Triturus cristatus presence/absence surveys in May 20144.  
Otter 
3.4 
The otter survey was carried out on all accessible water courses within the Survey Site. Survey 
methods followed those recommended in Chanin (2003)5. 
3.5 
The water courses, including the channel and banks, were systematically surveyed for signs of 
otter such as droppings (‘spraints’), runs and footprints.  All areas that were accessible were 
surveyed, and particular attention was given to suitable sprainting areas such as large, flat rocks or 
areas where otters were likely to leave the water course.  Otter spraint can be distinguished from 
other mammal droppings, such as mink, by its distinctive musky smell and the presence of fish 
bones.  Mink scats tend to be twisted in appearance and are smaller.   
3.6 
Signs of, or potential for, permanent dwellings (‘holts’) or resting places for otters were also 
recorded.  Holts and resting places include structures such as cavities in roots of bank side trees, 
piles of logs or flood debris, drains and caves.  Otters can also use resting places above ground in 
reed beds and dense scrub such as bramble Rubus fruticosa and blackthorn Prunus spinosa.   
Water Vole 
3.7 
All water courses that were accessible were surveyed within the optimal period for finding water 
vole (late April to early October). This is in line with survey standards set out in The Water Vole 
Conservation Handbook6. The water courses, including the channel and banks, were

systematically surveyed for signs of water vole such as latrines (a communal area of droppings), 
feeding stations and grazed lawns, burrows (wider than high, diameter 4-8 cm), runs and footprints.   
3.8 
In addition, an assessment was made of whether individual water courses have potential to support 
water vole. The Water Vole Conservation Handbook describes favourable water vole habitat as 
having: wide swathes of riparian vegetation to provide both food and shelter; easily penetrable 
earth banks; and slow flowing, relatively deep (over 1 m) slow flowing water courses.  Factors such 
as shallow water or over-shading by trees are generally unfavourable to water voles. 
Classification of Areas Surveyed for Otter and Water Vole 
3.9 
Target notes (TN) were used to describe the characteristics of the water courses surveyed and to 
record any field signs that were observed. These were mapped (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and the 
target notes included (Appendix 2). In order to further illustrate the findings of the survey, the 
streams and ditches were categorised as follows: 
3.10 
Habitat considered unsuitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of 
the following characteristics: no/low water levels; shaded; little vegetation; poached banks; no 
suitable resting places; no field signs of otter or water vole. 
3.11 
Habitat considered suitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of the 
following characteristics: permanent flow of water; vegetation on banks; minimal shading; suitable 
resting places present; signs of otter/water vole. 
3.12 
Photographs are included showing the characteristics of water courses within the Survey Site 
(Appendix 3).

Results  
Otter 
Desk Study 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 
and 2013. The closest record to the Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west of the River Llan.  At its 
closest point the River Llan is approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, 
within the same surface water catchment, and it links to the Survey Site via the stream running 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site. 
Field Survey 
4.2 
A single fresh otter spraint was found in the stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the 
Survey Site (see TN3, Figure 1, Appendix 1; and Appendix 2). At this point the stream is 
approximately 15 cm deep and with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks, the eastern bank is 
approximately 2 m high and sheer with over hanging trees. The western bank has an 
approximately 45 degree grass slope and is approximately 1.5 m high. 
4.3 
No other signs were observed that confirm otter presence in the other water courses within the 
Survey Site.  
4.4 
The stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site also had deep overhangs 
created by the root system of the mature hedge and trees on the east bank. These have potential 
to be used as resting places by otter (see Figure 1, Appendix 1). However, foraging opportunities 
for otters are likely to be limited due to the low water levels (20-30 cm), which would make the 
watercourse less suitable for fish, and therefore foraging otters.   
Water Vole 
Desk Study 
4.5 
SEWBReC provided three records of water vole, within a 2 km search radius. These records were 
from the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River 
is in the same surface water catchment as watercourses present in the Survey Site, so it is 
possible that water voles could move along water courses that are linked to the River Llan (see 
section 4.1 above). 
Field Survey 
4.6 
During the surveys many of the ditches that had contained water during the first Phase 1 habitat 
survey (in February after a very wet winter) had completely dried out by the time of the otter and 
water vole surveys in May and June 2014. The remaining water courses were fast running and 
shallow. The banks of the streams were often over-shaded with encroaching bramble and gorse or 
had steep, bare banks.  
4.7 
No field signs were observed during the surveys that clearly establish the presence of water vole. 
Some burrows were noted that had dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole 
Myodes glareolus and rats, but did not exhibit signs of current use (see TNs 1. 2, 4, 5 and 7). 
However, no associated latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed at any of these 
locations, Figure 1, Appendix 1; Appendix 2). There was also no evidence of associated burrows 
below the water line, which is typical of water vole burrows. The holes were therefore considered 
unlikely to be used by water vole and are more likely to have been created by another species of 
small mammal, such as bank vole Myodes glareolus, or been created by water vole but 
subsequently abandoned.

4.8 
No water vole field signs were observed at the ponds within the Survey Site during the great 
crested newt presence/absence surveys in May 20147. 
Incidental Sightings 
In addition to signs of otter and water vole presence recorded during the survey, some signs of 
badger activity were also noted and are included here for completeness. A single hole badger sett 
was found at TN9, with digging and a fresh latrine recorded at TN8.  
Limitations of Study 
4.9 
Some of the southern stretch of the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site had 
extensive bramble and scrub along the banks, with low over-hanging branches and debris in the 
stream itself. This impeded the view of the surveyors along this stretch. However, a large stretch of 
the northern section of the same stream was also surveyed without issue, and therefore this 
limitation should not affect the overall results of the survey. Areas that were inaccessible, or for 
which the visibility was limited due to extensive scrub, are also indicated on the map (Figure 1, 
Appendix 1).

Appendix 2: Target Notes (TN) 
 
Stream at TN1 - The stream is wooded, mostly shaded with shallow bramble covered banks. The 
stream bed is stony, water fast moving and shallow. This provides a sheltered corridor through 
which otter may commute, but no obvious resting places or signs of otter use were observed. 
 
1. 
At TN 1 there is a vertical 1m high bare mud bank on the western side of the stream. The stream is 
approximately 10 cm deep at this point. There is a hole 1 m above the water which had dimensions 
suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed.  
 
To the south of TN1 is a marshy field with a network of ditches - At the time of survey (May) these 
ditches were dry or contained very little water and had steep banks with very little or no vegetation. 
 
Stream at TN2 to TN10 – The stream is relatively unshaded, with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks. 
The water depth ranges from approximately 10 cm to 20 cm where pools form. It is fast flowing and 
appears clean. The eastern bank is approximately 2 m high and sheer. It is topped by a mature 
hedge the root system of which form a number of deep overhangs by the side of the stream. The 
west bank has an approximately 45 degree grassed slope.  
 
2. 
A hole was found in the vertical east bank, approximately 20 cm above the waterline, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
3. 
A fresh otter spraint was found on a large, flat stone in the middle of the stream. 
4. 
A pair of holes was found in the east bank approximately 1.5 m from the water line, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
5. 
A possible otter resting place on east bank. No otter field signs were observed. A 15 cm diameter 
hole was found leading into a cavity under the tree root bole, approximately 2 m above the water 
line. Approximately 3 m to the south of this there are three further holes, 1 m above the waterline 
on the eastern bank with dimensions that would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No 
water vole field signs were observed.  
6. 
Tributary of the main stream, this is a narrow brook that has dried out at its northern end. It is over 
shaded by scrub, no field signs for otter or water vole were observed. 
7. 
There is a particularly deep over-hang in the east bank under a root bole. Basal rocks are moss 
free on top suggesting that it may be regularly accessed; however no field signs of otter were 
observed. This has good potential as a resting place for otter. On the west bank, above a culvert 
pipe that runs into the stream from the brook at TN6 there are two holes with dimensions that 
would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs of water vole were 
observed. 
8. 
A deep cavity in the eastern bank along the waterline good provides a potential resting place for 
otter. No otter field signs were observed. On the top of the west bank opposite the cavity are a 
number of fresh patches of badger digging and a fresh badger latrine. 
9. 
A hole was found in the east bank 2 m above the water line; dimensions suggest that this is a 
badger sett. There is a mammal run into the field to the east.  
10. 
The stream becomes very shaded at this point, and the eastern bank is largely undercut providing 
several potential resting places for otter. No field signs were observed.  
 
Damp ditch/brook at TN11 to TN12 – to the north of TN11 this is a dry to damp ditch that has 
mainly bare banks, with some areas over-grown by bramble. It is open to horses and sheep and 
the land around the ditch is poached. No signs of otter or water vole were observed and this 
section is considered unsuitable for use by either species. To the south of TN11 the amount of 
water in the ditch gradually becomes greater until it forms a narrow brook, approximately 10 cm in 
depth.  
 
11. 
The brook is very over-grown with gorse and bramble, the banks are approximately 1 m high and 
the water is quick moving and shallow. There is a fenced culvert 10 m to the north which is partially 
blocked by debris from a fallen tree on the eastern bank. No field signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
12. 
The brook is shallow and fast moving with low grassy banks, over grown by bramble and nettle in 
large sections. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. South of this location the stream runs 
through woodland and connects to the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site.  
 
 
 
 
Stream at TN13 to TN18 – The southern section of the stream previously described in TN2 to 
TN10. The banks are lined with trees and a scrub understorey of predominantly bramble, the 
stream is approximately 10 cm – 20 cm deep with a rocky bed. The bank is approximately 1 – 2 m 
high and undercut in places. The extensive scrub impeded the surveyors’ ability to access the 
stream, however the length was walked and notes made when a good view was available. 
  
13. 
The stream is narrow, with a bare bank approximately 1 m on each side. It is encroached by 
bramble and gorse and is largely over shaded. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
14. 
A shallow ditch extending north-west of the stream, it is dry at the northern end, the banks and low 
and poached by horses. The south end contains a small amount of slow moving water and is 
overgrown with bramble.  
15. 
A similar ditch to TN14, this is dry to the north and the banks are poached by horses. No signs of 
otter or water vole were observed.  
16. 
The stream is wide, and fast moving, approximately 10 cm in depth. The banks are approximately 1 
m high and covered by bramble. There is some undercutting of the bank, although not deep 
enough to provide resting opportunities for otter. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
17. 
The stream is narrow and fast moving, approximately 15cm deep, banks are steep and bare 
topped with bramble. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
18. 
The stream is wide and fast flowing, approximately 20 cm deep. Root boles of trees along the 
western bank provide resting opportunities for otter. The eastern bank is low with a stone beach 
where the stream bends. No signs were observed however access was limited due to bramble and 
a fence on the western bank.  
 
Ditches and stream at TN19 to TN21 – ditches run along the edge of sheep pasture, most of 
these are dry with bare banks. A small brook runs from the edge of the woodland through the 
pasture and extends south outside of the site boundary.  
 
19. 
This is a dry sheep poached ditch. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
20. 
A shallow brook, approximately 10cm in depth with a 50cm high grassy bank to the west and trees 
along the eastern bank. There are fox runs along the western side. No signs of otter or water vole 
were observed.  
21. 
A nearly dry ditch, small trickle of water runs over a muddy bed. The banks are low and bare, the 
ditch is over shaded by trees which line each side. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
  
Water courses in and around wet woodland and National Grid land at TN22 to TN26 – There 
are shallow ditches along the edges of the woodland, with small streams running in the interior of 
the woodland. The streams are approximately 10 cm deep, containing leaf litter and debris. The 
banks are steep with little vegetation other than nettle.  
 
22. 
Very narrow, over-shaded steam with fast moving, shallow water. There is bramble encroaching on 
both banks. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
23. 
Slow flowing woodland ditch with little water, and a large amount of leaf litter and debris. The banks 
are low with no vegetation. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. The ditch to the north of 
this point becomes inaccessible.  
24. 
Similar to the ditch at TN23 this ditch is shallow with slow moving water and completely over 
shaded by the woodland, with large amounts of leaf litter. No otter or water vole signs were 
observed.  
25. 
Small stream along the east edge of the field to the east of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
Fast flowing, shallow (15 cm) with gravel and rock bed. Wide mammal run down to the stream at 
this point, though to be used by the sheep resident in the field. No signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
26. 
A dry ditch at the time of survey, shaded by trees and full of leaf litter.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey within 150 ha of pastoral 
farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in 2014, to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant.  
1.3 
Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site 
at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops 
were made to listen and scan for singing and calling birds. The Survey Site was visited on three 
occasions, once during each of April, May and June. A constant search effort was employed during 
each survey visit, with all habitat types being approached to within approximately 50 m.  
1.4 
Seven bird ‘species of principal importance for nature conservation’ as referred to in Section 42 of 
the NERC Act 2006 (S42) (dunnock Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer domesticus, linnet 
Carduelis cannabina, lesser redpoll Carduelis cabaret, skylark Alauda arvensis, song thrush 
Turdus philomelos, and tree pipit Anthus trivialis) were considered likely to breed on site. All seven 
S42 species recorded within the Survey Site are also red-listed species of conservation concern in 
Wales (RSPB, 2009), with the exception of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An additional seven 
amber-listed species, bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, meadow pipit 
Anthus pratensis, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, 
whitethroat Sylvia communis and willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus were also considered to 
have bred. 
1.5 
No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended) (Schedule 1 species) were recorded, although two Schedule 1 species were recorded 
during the surveys, as follows. A pair of red kite Milvus milvus was recorded mobbing a peregrine 
falcon Falco peregrinus over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station land during survey in May. A 
pair of kites was also recorded flying over the eastern boundary in the northern compartment of the 
Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the timing of the records, and that at least one pair 
were recorded during survey it is likely that red kite breed locally but that the single record of 
peregrine referred to a transient bird. No evidence was found to suggest breeding of either species 
occurred within the Survey Site during 2014.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey to 
inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description  
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within the Survey Site.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecological survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including a breeding bird survey.  These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix 
to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The survey work undertaken at Abergelli Farm between April and June 2014 aimed to establish: 
 
The number of species present on the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat; 
 
The number of territories held by each species, and 
 
Whether the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat is used by bird species of high 
conservation interest, including: 
(a) Species protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended); 
(b) Species listed on Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of 
Wild Birds; 
(c) Species listed in Section 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(NERC 2006) as species of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in 
Wales; 
(d) Species listed in the Swansea Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP); and

(e) Species listed as having a Red or Amber population status1 (RSPB, 2009). 
 
                                                      
1 Seven quantitative criteria are used to assess the population status of each bird species and to categorise it on the red, 
amber or green list of conservation concern (species that are red-listed are of greatest conservation concern whereas 
those that are green-listed are not considered to be of particular conservation priority or (in a few cases) have insufficient 
data to be robustly categorised). Criteria considered are: global conservation status; evidence of recent decline; evidence 
of historical decline; an unfavourable European conservation status; rarity (in terms of breeding numbers); restricted 
(localised) distribution; and whether a species is considered to be of international conservation importance (featuring in 
the list of birds in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive 1979).  When considering whether a species is added to the red or the 
amber list, factors such as the extent of decline and range contraction are considered.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on European designated 
sites was requested from within 10 km with information on national statutory designated sites was 
requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the Survey Site boundary and 
information regarding non-statutory designated sites and information on protected2 or notable 
species (particularly those identified as S42 species and/or of local conservation importance or 
LBAP3 species), including birds, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from 
the Survey Site boundary. In addition, an initial study of on-line aerial photographs, topographical, 
and Ordnance Survey maps was made using web-based resources including: Where’s the path?4, 
Google Maps5 and Google Earth Version 6 (Google Inc, 2010). This, together with the results from 
a preliminary ecological appraisal6 carried out in February 2014 and updated in April 2014, resulted 
in a detailed understanding of the habitats and features on the Survey Site along with an indication 
of the bird community potentially present. 
Field Survey 
3.2 
The method used was adapted from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Common Bird Census 
(CBC) as described by Gilbert et al. (1998), Although eight to ten visits are usually undertaken for 
CBC sites being monitored over the long term, it is generally accepted that for the purposes of 
assessing potential environmental impacts, three visits are sufficient to describe the value of a 
Survey Site for breeding birds and give an approximation of the number of breeding bird territories 
present within a Survey Site (e.g. SNH, 20057). Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along 
field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be 
located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops were made to listen and scan for singing and 
calling birds.  All habitat features were approached to within approximately 50 m, except in horse 
pasture fields. Transects were not walked across closely grazed pasture fields, as it was possible 
to easily view birds by scanning from field boundaries (due to the lack of vegetation and small field 
sizes) and to avoid disturbing horses that were kept in many of them at the time of the survey. Bird 
locations were mapped using standard two-letter British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) codes, and 
bird activity was recorded using standard BTO behaviour codes (Marchant 1983).  
3.3 
The breeding status of birds recorded was categorised as either ‘holding territory’ or ‘showing other 
evidence of breeding’. Birds presumed to be holding territory were those recorded in song. Other 
evidence of breeding included observations of: 
 
Distraction display or injury feigning; 
 
Used nests or eggshells found (occupied or laid within the survey period); 
 
Recently fledged young or downy young; 
 
Adults entering or leaving a nest site in circumstances indicating an occupied nest or an adult 
sitting on nest; 
 
Adults carrying food for young or faecal sacs; 
 
Nest containing eggs; and 
 
Nest with young seen or heard.

3.4 
The presence of house sparrow near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for 
breeding in this species. 
3.5 
The results of the three breeding bird territory mapping surveys were combined to create a single 
map showing all birds considered to be holding territory (Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1). BTO 
codes for each species illustrated in Figure 1a and 1b are provided in Table 2 (below). Where a 
bird was observed in the same location during more than one survey visit, and this is judged to be 
the same individual bird, only one registration of that bird is shown on the map. Where more than 
one individual of the same species is shown in close proximity, these are individual birds seen 
simultaneously during a single survey. Note the locations of presumed territories do not represent 
specific nest locations. 
3.6 
The Survey Site was divided into two survey compartments due to its size; the first covered the 
north of the Survey Site (the land north of the gallops that runs from the houses at Abergelli Farm 
to the south-east corner of the Survey Site), and the second covered the south of the Survey Site 
(the land south of the gallops).  Three survey visits were made to each compartment; one in each 
of late April, late May and mid-June.  Table 1 below provides details of the duration and weather 
conditions during surveys.

3.7 
The Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the National Grid electrical substation compounds to the 
south-west of the Survey Site were not entered, due to lack of access. The compounds can be 
viewed adequately from the fence and there is very little suitable habitat for breeding birds within 
these compounds. The land immediately beyond the northern and eastern Survey Site boundaries 
was also not entered. The surveyor(s) scanned areas of adjacent habitat by walking paths and field 
edges and made use of local vantage-points to record species present around the access 
restricted areas. This enabled the entire site to be sampled without trespassing. 
3.8 
In late June, all buildings within the  Survey Site, with the exception of those within the National 
Grid compounds referred to above, were inspected for barn owl Tyto alba presence or other 
evidence of presence, such as pellets, nests, or faecal matter. The buildings were primarily visited 
to inspect for bat roosts and the methods are described in detail in the bat roost inspection report. 
Anecdotal evidence from the land owner prior to inspection suggested that none of the buildings 
were in use or had historically been used by barn owl. All trees within the Survey Site were also 
inspected from ground level for evidence of use by bats and barn owl. A sub-set of these trees 
were identified for further roped-access (tree-climbing) survey that involved internal and external 
inspection of these trees. Full details of these surveys are provided in the bat survey report. 
3.9 
The maps from the three visits were combined.  For species where definitive evidence of breeding 
was not obtained, professional judgement (based on a range of factors including knowledge of 
habitat requirements, local status and/or repeat sightings) was used to conclude whether breeding 
was likely.  A precautionary approach was taken, with species suspected to have bred being 
plotted as having done so.

Results  
Desk Study Data 
4.1 
A full list of the European designated sites within 10 km, national statutory designated sites within 5 
km, and non-statutory designated sites within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary is provided in the 
preliminary ecological appraisal.  Sites that include a cited ornithological interest are described 
below. 
Statutory Sites of Nature Conservation Importance 
4.2 
Carmarthen Bay and the tidal estuaries that extend from it, approximately 7.2 km west of the 
Survey Site, has been afforded multiple designations and is referred to under the umbrella term 
European Marine Site (EMS8) which includes the Carmarthen Bay area and Estuaries Special Area 
of Conservation (SAC9), and the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA10). This area also 
contains a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar11). The boundaries of each of 
these sites are not contiguous but all fall within the EMS site. The details of each designation are 
provided below.  
4.3 
The Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar, located approximately 9.7 km west south-west of the Survey 
Site, is classified for large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that feed in the 
saltmarshes and on the intertidal mud and sand. 
4.4 
The SPA has been classified as it supports important overwintering populations of eleven migratory 
species of waterfowl and an assemblage of 34,962 wintering water fowl including common 
shelduck Tadorna tadorna, Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, northern 
pintail Anas acuta, shoveler Anas clypeata, Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, grey 
plover Pluvialis squatarola,  red knot Calidris canutus, dunlin Calidris alpina alpina, Eurasian curlew 
Numenius arquata, and common redshank Tringa totanus.  The SPA includes extensive areas of 
intertidal sand and mud-flats, large sand dune systems and the largest continuous area of 
saltmarsh in Wales. 
4.5 
The spring and autumn population of common redshank, and wintering population of northern 
pintail, Eurasian oystercatcher, and red knot are qualifying features for the Burry Inlet Ramsar 
designation. 
4.6 
The Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, located approximately 7.2 km to the west, is designated 
for its ‘Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time’, ‘Estuaries’, ‘Mudflats and 
sandflats not covered by water at low tide’, ‘Large shallow inlets and bays’, ‘Salicornia and other 
annuals colonising mud and sand’, and ‘Atlantic salt meadows’. 
Non-Statutory Sites 
4.7 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in detail in the preliminary ecological appraisal.  Three SINCs lie partially 
within the Survey Site boundary, of which two have cited ornithological interest. 
4.8 
Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which includes three fields that lie within the 
north-east corner of the Survey Site. The site is designated for its wet woodland and woodland with 
                                                      
8 The term ‘European Marine Sites’ (EMS) collectively describes Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) that are covered by tidal waters and protect some of our most important marine and coastal 
habitats and species of European importance. 
9 SACs are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive in order to conserve the 189 habitat types 
and 788 faunal species identified in Annexes I and II of the Directive (as amended).  They do not afford protection to 
birds directly (although are often subject to various other designations that do have an ornithological component and 
often offer protection to habitats of value to a range of bird species).   
10 SPAs are internationally important sites classified in accordance with Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild 
birds (commonly referred to as the Bird Directive).   
11 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

approximately 1 km south-west of the Survey Site, and Penllergaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and 
Railway Line, located approximately 1 km south of the Survey Site. 
4.14 
The Penllergaer Forest SINC is designated for its range of woodland types, purple moor grass and 
rush pasture, reedbeds and watercourses.  Species of bird listed on the SINC form include 
Northern goshawk, common kingfisher Alcedo atthis, lesser redpoll, common cuckoo, lesser 
spotted woodpecker Picoides minor, common grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia, common 
crossbill Loxia curvirostra, red kite, house sparrow, wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, green

4.15 
Penllegaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and Railway Line SINC is also designated for its range of 
woodland types, purple moor grass and rush pasture, scrub and watercourses. Species of bird 
listed on the SINC form include tree pipit, lesser redpoll, common bullfinch, and song thrush. It is 
unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.16 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. 
Species Data 
4.17 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl Tyto alba. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the 
west of the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south 
west near Penllergaer Woods in 2000. The most recent record is from approximately 3.7 km north-
west of the Survey Site in April 2013. An additional 5 records were provided for the last 10 years, 
the nearest of which was recorded in 2007, approximately 2 km south-west of the Survey Site,   
4.18 
A red kite was noted circling above a field in the north-west corner of the Survey Site and also over 
Abergelli Farm during the Phase 1 Survey in April 2014. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red

kite between 1999 and 2013, the record nearest the Survey Site being approximately 150 m to the 
east. 
4.19 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew, northern lapwing and skylark.  A total of 63 records of 
lapwing were provided from between 2000 and 2009, all south of the Survey Site.  The closest of 
these records are located at the tinplate workings site near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 
km to the south-west of the Survey Site boundary.  There was one record of curlew from 2011, 
located at the Lliw Reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.20 
A full list of species, returned from the data search can be found in Table 3 in Appendix 2. 
Breeding Bird Survey (2014) 
4.21 
A total of 53 species were recorded on the Survey Site during the breeding bird survey in 2014. Of 
these, 46 were passerines (including near-passerines) and 7 non-passerines. 
Breeding passerines 
4.22

12 The number of territories where other evidence was found to confirm breeding is indicated. Other evidence of breeding 
was considered to include observations of adults carrying nesting material or food, adults being repeatedly alarmed or 
engaging in territorial disputes, and families including juveniles accompanied by adults. The presence of house sparrow 
near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for breeding in this species.

28 species of passerine were noted holding breeding territories on the Survey Site. An additional 
two species, lesser redpoll and house sparrow, were observed showing other evidence of 
breeding. 
4.24 
No passerine species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended)13 were recorded. 
4.25 
Nine Section 4214 species (cuckoo, dunnock, grasshopper warbler, house sparrow, linnet, lesser 
redpoll, skylark, song thrush, and tree pipit) were considered likely to breed on the Survey Site. All 
nine Section 42 species recorded within the Survey Site are also listed in the Swansea LBAP15, 
and are red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB Undated), with the exception of 
dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch, mistle thrush, 
meadow pipit, reed bunting, redstart, whitethroat and willow warbler were also considered to have 
bred. 
4.26 
Willow warbler was the most abundant breeding species on the Survey Site. Large numbers of 
territories were also held by other passerines typical of a lowland farmland mosaic habitat including 
chiffchaff, chaffinch, robin and wren. Of the Section 42 species recorded, dunnock and song thrush 
were most abundant, with territories widely distributed across the Survey Site. The abundance of 
willow warbler, dunnock and song thrush on the Survey Site may be attributed to the relatively 
wide-ranging habitat preferences of these generalist species (and the tendency of the former two 
species to breed in scrub).  
4.27 
The presence of ground nesting species (skylark and meadow pipit) within the Survey Site reflects 
the fact that much of the Survey Site is grazed pasture. However, the distribution of these species 
was localised, only being recorded in the pasture fields in the north-west of the Survey Site. Other 
species recorded on the pasture habitat during survey in April include stonechat, for which two 
territories were recorded, and northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe which were likely to have 
been on passage and not remained to breed on site. Stonechat and wheatear were not recorded 
during breeding bird surveys in May and June. However, see Incidental Records below.  
                                                      
13 Schedule 1 birds receive full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), In addition to the 
protection from killing or taking that all birds, their nests and eggs have under the Act, Schedule 1 birds and their young 
must not be disturbed at the nest. 
14 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) required the Welsh Assembly Government 
(WAG), based on advice from the Countryside Council for Wales (now part of Natural Resources Wales), to identify 
species and habitats of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales.  Section 42 of The NERC Act 
requires the WAG to take steps to “further the conservation” of these species/habitats. 
15 Based on the 2005 consultation draft of the Swansea LBAP. The forthcoming replacement to this plan will be expected 
to reflect Section 42 Species and Habitats more closely.

4.28 
Grasshopper warbler was associated with marshy areas in the north-western part of the Survey 
Site which reflect the species’ breeding habitat preferences. The species was only recorded during 
survey in April. No further records were made during dusk bat surveys or moth trap surveys carried 
out on the Survey Site during 2014. All registrations of cuckoo were beyond the Survey Site 
boundary. These were recorded near Lletty’r Bugail, approximately 300 m north of the Survey Site 
and at Waun y Garn-wen, and approximately 100 m west of the Survey Site, during survey in April 
and near a pond, north of Cefn-betingau, approximately 100 m east of the Survey Site during 
survey in May.  
4.29 
House sparrow colonies were recorded at the barn north of Abergelli Farm during all survey visits 
and at the Abergelli Farm buildings during the survey in May and June. The individual count was 26 
during the visit in April, 20 during the survey in May and 18 during the survey in June. Therefore, 
the number of breeding pairs within the Survey Site is likely to be between nine and 13. 
4.30 
A family of lesser redpoll were observed in scrub bordering the marshy grassland to the west of the 
Survey Site during the survey in June. Two birds were also recorded in this area during the survey 
in April. No further evidence of breeding in this species was recorded. Observations of single 
individuals were made near the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National Grid electrical 
substation during survey in May and June. 
4.31 
Three tree pipit territories were recorded during survey. These were recorded immediately south of 
the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in May and around the fringes of marshy grassland in 
the western part of the Survey Site and in the scrub line on the north-east corner of the Survey Site 
in June. Tree pipit were recorded during all survey visits, with flocks of up to 14 observed over the 
marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site during survey work in May. A family of tree 
pipit were recorded on a field boundary in the south-east corner of the Survey Site in June. Two 
pairs of tree pipit were observed immediately south of the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in 
June. It is likely that these records are of breeding pairs. 
4.32 
Indicative central territory locations are shown on Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1. 
Non-Passerines 
4.33 
Red kite were recorded during surveys in April and May. A bird was noted flying over the houses at 
Abergelli Farm and over the pasture in the northern part of the Survey Site during the survey in 
April. Two red kites were recorded mobbing a peregrine falcon over the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station land during the survey in May. An apparent pair was also recorded flying over the eastern 
boundary in the northern compartment of the Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the 
timing of the records, and that at least one pair was recorded during the survey in May it is likely 
that red kite breed locally. However, no evidence was found to suggest breeding occurred within 
the Survey Site during 2014.  
4.34 
Red kite are listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
and Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds making it an 
offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb birds at, on or near an ‘active’ nest, or to directly 
threaten birds, such as deliberately kill or capture birds, destroy their nests or take their eggs. 
4.35 
A peregrine falcon was observed flying over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National 
Grid electrical substation during survey in May. There is limited suitable breeding habitat within the 
Survey Site for peregrine falcon, and therefore this species is only likely to visit the Survey Site to 
forage on an occasional basis. Electricity pylons within the Survey Site were scanned from the 
ground for the presence of peregrine (and corvid) nests. No evidence of crow nests, which are 
sometimes appropriated by peregrine were found. Peregrine falcon is listed under Schedule 1 Part 
1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). 
4.36 
It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, 
although no trees were found that appear, from a ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large 
cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy fields in the north-west and at the southern end 
of the Survey Site could provide habitat for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) 
given the thick, tussocky structure of some parts of the sward. There was no evidence that barn 
owl breed within the Survey Site, and are unlikely to have done so in the recent past due to lack of 
droppings in the buildings and anecdotal evidence to this effect from the landowner. No signs of

barn owl presence were found during building inspections and no birds were recorded during the 
breeding bird surveys. 
Incidental Records 
4.37 
Species recorded during other survey work in the bird breeding season but not recorded during 
breeding bird surveys are described below. 
4.38 
10 male and two female wheatear were observed on the horse pasture in the northern part of the 
Survey Site during a bat transect recce on 24 April 2014, and were presumably transient migrant 
birds.  
4.39 
Young tawny owls Strix aluco were heard calling near the houses in the western part of the Survey 
Site during a moth survey on 16 June, with birds of unknown age heard during a second survey on 
13 August 2014. This suggests that tawny owl bred on the Survey Site in 2014, presumably in the 
woodland block immediately to the south-west of Abergelli Farm, although much of the woodland 
within the Survey Site is suitable nesting habitat for this species. No further observations of tawny 
owl were made. A goshawk (female) was observed flying over the Survey Site at dusk on 16 June, 
and a sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, was recorded roosting in a tree near the aforementioned 
houses on 13 August. 
4.40 
Red kite were observed flying over the marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site 
during a dormouse survey on 29 May, and near Abergelli Farm during bat transect surveys on 22 
May and 17 July 2014.Single red kites flying over the Survey Site were also recorded during Phase 
1 habitat surveys on 24 February 2014 and 14 April 2014. 
4.41 
A spotted flycatcher Muscicapa striata was recorded in the hedge-line near the two houses on 17 
June 2014. Spotted flycatcher is a Section 42 species of principal importance in Wales, is listed in 
the Swansea LBAP and is a red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009).

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
A Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment for great crested newts Triturus cristatus (GCN) was 
carried out at accessible ponds as part of the preliminary ecological appraisal of the Project Site at 
the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). The results of the HSI 
assessment are set out in the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (BSG, June 2014). APL 
subsequently commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence survey for GCN of 
ponds within 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in May 2014, to inform and 
support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.3 
Owing to the size and nature of the Survey Site, and the lack of GCN records in the desk study 
search area, it was recommended that a survey for GCNs be conducted for all ponds within the 
Survey Site boundary and within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary. A total of five ponds were 
surveyed including three within the Survey Site and a further two within 250 m of the Survey Site 
boundary. It was not possible to access a number of ponds, which included: 
 
seven ponds outside of the Survey Site but within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary; and 
 
a further four ponds between 250m and 500m from the Survey Site boundary that formed part 
of a cluster of ponds, the remainder of which were within 250m of the Survey Site boundary. 
1.4 
The survey did not record any GCNs in the ponds surveyed, although palmate newts Lissotriton 
helveticus were recorded in three ponds and smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris were recorded in 
two ponds. As a consequence, further surveys to establish the population size class of GCN were 
not necessary and were not undertaken.

Introduction 
 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence GCN 
survey in May 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including presence / absence survey for GCNs. These baseline surveys will be included in 
an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for 
submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the GCN survey were to identify whether GCNs are present in the ponds within the 
Survey Site and those within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary using standard survey methods 
(as specified in Section 3).

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on protected1 species, 
including GCNs, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site 
boundary. The National Biodiversity Network Gateway2 was also checked for records for 1 x 1 km 
grid squares in which GCN records have occurred. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area were also reviewed to identify ponds that might be present within the 
Survey Site and 500 m of the boundary based on recommendations made in the Natural England 
(formerly English Nature) GCN Mitigation Guidelines3 (the selection of an appropriate buffer 
distance for survey is explained in more detail below). 
Scoping (HSI) Survey 
3.2 
A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated 
in April 20144. As part of this survey, all accessible ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site were 
visited and assessed against the criteria of Oldham et al. (2000)5. This was to establish the 
likelihood of their use by GCNs using a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI), and to identify the scope of 
the GCN presence/absence field survey described below.  
3.3 
The information collected during the HSI assessment provides context of how ponds within or in 
proximity to the Survey Site may connect with habitat available for newts in the surrounding 
landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.4 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond within 250 m of the Survey 
Site was collected, to enable an HSI score to be derived for each pond, by applying the scoring 
system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008)6. Where a cluster of 
ponds was found (P01-P08; see Figure 1) with some ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site and 
some ponds beyond this distance, the intention was to carry out an HSI on all ponds within the 
cluster (although lack of access prevented this in this case).   
3.5 
The HSI is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond including features 
such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are then used to 
calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the least 
suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in one of five 
categories defining its suitability for GCNs as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8  
 
= excellent 
3.6 
In addition, there are a number of wet ditches present within the Survey Site and within 250 m of 
the Survey Site boundary. All of the wet ditches are narrow (<1 m width) and did not hold more 
than a few centimetres of water during February – June 2014 despite an exceptionally wet winter.

They are not thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs and presence / absence surveys are not 
considered to be required for these waterbodies.  
Field Survey 
3.7 
Following the initial HSI assessment (see above) four GCN survey visits were undertaken within 
the period mid-March to mid-June to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during 
mid-April to mid-May), with an additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population 
size if GCN were found during the first four surveys. The GCN field survey work was undertaken in 
2014 and was completed in accordance with the Natural England (2001) GCN Mitigation 
Guidelines.  
3.8 
In determining the distance at which presence/absence survey of ponds would take place, Natural 
England guidance has been considered and an approach developed that is proportionate to the 
likelihood of encountering GCNs (Note that where a survey is conducted in Wales, Natural 
Resources Wales advise that the Natural England guidance is consulted.) 
3.9 
Natural England guidance on geographical limits of survey is discussed in Section 5.4 of the GCN 
Mitigation Guidelines which recommends that:  
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500 m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
3.10 
Natural England guidance is further developed in the GCN Method Statement7  which states that:  
“In keeping with a proportionate and risk-based approach, surveys need reasonable boundaries. 
The great crested newt mitigation guidelines explain that surveys of ponds up to around 500m from 
the development might need to be surveyed. The decision on whether to survey depends primarily 
on how likely it is that the development would affect newts using those ponds. For developments 
resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, 
carefully consider whether a survey is appropriate. Surveys of land at this distance from ponds are 
normally appropriate when all of the following conditions are met: (a) maps, aerial photos, walk-
over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to support a large great crested 
newt population, (b) the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes 
the majority available locally, (c) the development would have a substantial negative effect on that 
habitat, and (d) there is an absence of dispersal barriers.” 
3.11 
The approach that has been taken for these field surveys is consistent with the above guidance 
and advice from Natural England. Where access was available, presence/absence surveys for 
GCN were carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the Project Site. The exception to this were 
pond clusters that are interconnected to each other (less than 250 m apart) and which therefore 
could be considered to be part of the same population (should GCN be found). However, no such 
ponds (P01-P08 and P012-P014) were accessible as shown on Figure 1. As explained in the 
limitations section below, it is not considered to be a significant constraint to the findings of the 
survey that some ponds could not be accessed. 
Limitations of study 
3.12 
The GCN field surveys were undertaken within the recommended survey period and in suitable 
weather conditions apart from the torchlight survey and egg search on 19/05/2014 where heavy 
rain occurred leaving some ponds turbid, making survey less effective for a short period. 
Nevertheless, the surveys were considered to be effective despite the reduced visibility. 
3.13 
Two ponds (P07 and P08) located within the Water Treatment Works to the northwest of Project 
Site that were classified during the HSI assessment as being of ‘average’ or ‘good’ value for GCNs 
could not be surveyed due to access not being granted by landowners. In addition, access was not 
granted by landowners to Ponds P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P06, P12, P13 and P14, which would 
have been surveyed for presence/absence of GCN, had access been possible.

3.14 
In considering the significance of not surveying the inaccessible ponds both within and beyond 250 
m from the Project Site, it is useful to examine the results of the presence / absence surveys for 
those ponds that could be surveyed, as well as the results of the desk study, which places the 
Survey Site into a wider context (see 4.1). The presence/absence survey did not reveal the 
presence of GCNs in any of the five ponds surveyed, although three of the ponds supported 
smooth and /or palmate newts and were also thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs. This 
included all ponds within the Survey Site, three of which were of ‘average’ suitability as derived 
from the Habitat Suitability Assessment. The Survey Site is on the edge of the known range of 
GCN and the lack of desk study records within 2 km of the Survey Site is consistent with this, as is 
a search of the National Biodiversity Network website where the closest record of GCN was 
approximately 7.5 km from the Survey Site.  
3.15 
The conclusion that may be drawn is that since suitable ponds within the Survey Site were not 
occupied by GCNs, and no GCN records have been located within 7 km of the Survey Site, it is 
unlikely that GCNs are present in the inaccessible ponds. Notwithstanding this, if any of the ponds 
that were not surveyed (most are beyond 250 m from the Survey Site) did indeed support GCNs, it 
is likely that they would be present in such low numbers and at a sufficient distance from the 
Survey Site as to be unaffected by the Project. A Natural England funded research report into 
trapping efficiency on sites where GCNs are present (Cresswell and Whitworth, 2004) supports this 
assertion. It arrives at the conclusion that very few animals were captured at distances greater than 
100 m from a breeding pond. As a consequence, it is not considered to be a significant constraint 
to the findings of the survey that some ponds could not be surveyed.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
No records of GCNs within 2 km of the Survey Site were returned by SEWBReC.  The closest 1 x 1 
km Grid Square in which GCN records have occurred is ca. 7.5 km to the south-east of the Survey 
Site, near Llandarcy8. 
Scoping survey 
4.2 
Twelve ponds were identified within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two (P16 and P17) were identified within the Survey Site 
boundary, 10 (P05, P06, P07, P08, P09, P10, P12, P13, P14, and P15) were located within 250 m 
of the Survey Site and another four (P01, P02, P03, and P04) beyond 250m of the Survey Site but 
forming part of a cluster of ponds (with P05-P08) within the Water Treatment Works to north-west 
of the Survey Site. An additional on-site pond (P11) was found whilst carrying out other survey 
work on 21 May 2014 in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site. An HSI 
assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that were accessible within 250 m of the Survey 
Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit (in February).  This included: the two on-site 
ponds (P16 and P17); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary (P15); and ponds within 
250 m of the Survey Site boundary for which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). An 
HSI assessment was also carried out on P11 following its discovery in May 2014.

Figure 1 shows which ponds were surveyed and which were inaccessible on private land.

The Survey Site lies in a part of Wales where the distribution of GCNs is patchy, with the species 
largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this reduces the probability that GCNs would 
be present within the Survey Site, it does not rule out their presence.  There are a number of ponds 
in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their terrestrial phase, including old 
hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey Site.  Accordingly, whilst the 
ponds surveyed did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, they did have potential to provide 
breeding habitat for GCNs.  
4.6 
The scoping exercise concluded that surveys should be carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the 
Survey Site boundary, except P09, which was a small recession with a small amount of water in 
February and completely dry in April. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within the 
grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate) and it was concluded that 
surveys of this cluster of ponds (including P01, P02, P03 and P04) should also be carried out 
following the rationale explained in Section 3.7.

4.7 
GCN presence-absence surveys were carried out on Ponds P10, P11, P15, P16, and P17. P15 
dried out completely between the first and second visits and was only surveyed once. The ponds 
within the Water Treatment Works (P01-P08), including four ponds beyond 250m from the Survey 
Site could not be surveyed: access to these ponds was denied on grounds of Health & Safety. In 
addition, access was denied to the cluster of three ponds (P12-P14) to the east of the Survey Site. 
The land surrounding these ponds contains Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica (an invasive 
species) and is subject to an exclusion and treatment programme which precludes access to third-
parties due to the risk of spreading the plant. 
4.8 
Surveys between May 12th and May 22nd were carried out by Stephanie Boocock MCIEEM under 
the class licence (WML-CL08) with assistance from Caitlin McCann, Owain Waters and Rachel 
Taylor. For Pond 11, which was identified late during other surveys, the third and fourth visits were 
carried out by Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM under license number (52219:OTH:SA:2014) with 
assistance from Rachel Taylor and Gareth Lang. On each visit, weather conditions, including air 
temperature were recorded. Table 1 gives details of the surveys.

The likely absence of GCNs was established for all five ponds surveyed in 2014 the four presence / 
absence surveys. Additional surveys to make a population size class assessment were not 
required (following Natural England 2001).

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified that invasive species of plants, as listed under Part 
II of Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA), 1981 (as amended) (specifically 
Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera), are present 
on the Survey Site in a number of areas. The report recommended that a detailed survey to map 
the distribution of any invasive species should be carried out to inform any management measures 
that would need to be implemented to remove or control the spread of these species during the 
construction and operation of the Project.  
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive survey of streams and wet ditches 
within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 within the Survey 
Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.4 
The Survey Site was surveyed in July 2014 by an ecologist from BSG Ecology.  All accessible 
areas of the Survey Site were walked with areas of dense scrub assessed from the perimeter of the 
scrub, and the presence of five species included under Part II were recorded within the Survey 
Site: Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam, rhododendron Rhododendron ponticum, floating 
pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and montbretia Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora. 
1.5 
Of the five species Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed were the most widespread within 
the Survey Site.

Introduction 
2.1 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive species survey in May 2014 to inform 
and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which incorporates a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of 
Phase 2 surveys, including a survey for invasive species.  The methods and results of baseline 
surveys will be provided as appendices to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, 
which is intended for submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Background to Survey 
2.6 
For the purposes of this survey, invasive plant species are defined as those species of non-native 
plants included in part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 (as amended).   
2.7 
Since its creation in 1981, part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981, pertaining to 
invasive plants, has undergone many revisions, to the extent that the original four species has now 
been expanded to include over 30 invasive plant species. 
2.8 
The Phase 1 survey of the Survey Site was carried out in three phases, in February 2014 and 
updated in April 2014, and July 2014.  The timing of the first two surveys during the winter and 
early spring meant that the presence of some of the Schedule 9 species was missed as the 
vegetative parts of the plants (growing above ground) can be absent during the colder months of 
the year, with the plant persisting, over winter, below ground as rhizomes or lying dormant in the 
seed bank.  Because of this it was recommended in the Phase 1 survey report that a dedicated 
invasive species survey should be undertaken within the main botanical survey season (May to 
September) to attempt to map the distribution and extent of Schedule 9 species within the Survey 
Site.

Aims of Study 
2.9 
The aim of the survey is to confirm the presence and identify the locations of species of plant 
included under Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981.

Methods 
3.1 
No standard method exists for invasive plant species survey; and the survey was based on an 
ecological walkover survey approach, whereby all accessible areas of the Survey Site were walked 
by the surveyor in daylight hours, with a visual search for the target species undertaken.  
3.2 
Particular focus was also given to areas where the target species were most likely to be found, for 
example water courses, areas of disturbed ground and tracks where imported material may have 
been used or where fly-tipping or movements of vehicles or machinery could have led to the spread 
of these species.  
3.3 
Where found to be present, the species and location were recorded using a handheld GPS. The 
locations of individual plants, small clusters and large clusters of plants found during the walkover 
survey are provided in Figure 1. The locations are representative and do not necessarily provide 
mapping of the exact extent of each species or the precise location of each individual plant.  
Limitations of Study 
3.4 
The scale of the Survey Site and the presence of dense areas of scrub or woodland understorey in 
some areas mean that it is possible that small stands or individual plants of invasive species could 
have been missed during the walkover survey.  In addition, the presence of horses in some fields 
restricted access to some areas of the Survey Site although these areas were assessed using 
binoculars and it is likely, given the heavily grazed nature of these fields, that most invasive plant 
species would have been visible using binoculars. It is considered that the majority of the Survey 
Site was surveyed adequately and that overall the distribution of invasive species across the 
Survey Site has been mapped accurately.  
3.5 
The mapping produced in support of the report is based on point locations taken using a handheld 
GPS device which is subject to varying degrees of accuracy depending on satellite coverage and 
other factors.  Further to this the GPS locations recorded were for the main aggregation of each 
plant species at each location.   Each point therefore does not represent full coverage of the 
species at each point.  Any invasive plant management plan should take account of this with up to 
date, detailed surveying by a qualified land surveyor undertaken to provide accurate extents of 
species coverage. The distribution of each invasive plant species will, inevitably, change from year 
to year to a greater or lesser extent and these locations should be re-checked as necessary.

Results 
4.1 
Five species of plant included on Part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 were recorded during the 
survey: Japanese knotweed; Himalayan balsam; rhododendron; floating pennywort; and 
montbretia.  The locations and extents of these species are shown on Figure 1. 
4.2 
The most frequently recorded species were Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.   
4.3 
Japanese knotweed was found to be strongly associated with roads and trackways on the Survey 
Site as well as the area of inert landfill in the north-west half of the Survey Site.  This perennial 
species is typically spread through the movement of contaminated soils or through spreading of 
vegetative parts through flailing of hedges or movement of other machinery. 
4.4 
Himalayan balsam is an annual plant that is typically found in wetter habitats, although it will 
tolerate drier conditions.  It is strongly associated with woodland, stream corridors and ditches 
across the Survey Site. 
4.5 
Rhododendron is restricted to woodlands with a small patch occurring in the marshy grassland 
area in the north-west of the Survey Site.  Montbretia was recorded in two locations alongside 
roads, which is a typical location for this species to be found in given that it is often spread from the 
fly tipping of garden waste. 
4.6 
Floating pennywort was found in one of the Survey Site ponds in the south-east of the Survey 
Site2.

search are given an identification number. This number identifies the feature on the mapping and correlates it to the 
additional information provided below. This identification number precedes all other information and takes the fol-
lowing format -Id: 1, Id: 2, etc. Where numerous features on the same map are in such close proximity that the num -
bers would obscure each other a letter identifier is used instead to represent the features. (e.g. Three features which 
overlap may be given the identifier “A” on the map and would be identified separately as features 1A, 3A, 10A on the 
data tables provided). 
Where a feature is reported in the data tables to a distance greater than the map area, it is noted in the data table as 
“Not Shown”. 
All distances given in this report are in Metres (m). Directions are given as compass headings such as N: North, E: East, 
NE: North East from the nearest point of the study site boundary.

Classification
Soil Vulnerability Category
Description
0
On Site
Minor Aquifer/High Leaching 
Potential
H2
Deep, permeable, coarse textured 
soils which readily transmit a wide 
range of pollutants because of 
their rapid drainage and low 
attenuation potential.
0
On Site
Minor Aquifer/Low Leaching 
Potential
L
Soils in which pollutants are 
unlikely to penetrate the soil layer 
because either water movement is 
largely horizontal, or they have the 
ability to attenuate diffuse 
pollutants.
0
On Site
Minor Aquifer/Intermediate 
Leaching Potential
I1
Soils which can possibly transmit a 
wide range of pollutants.
0
On Site
Minor Aquifer/High Leaching 
Potential
H1
Soils which readily transmit liquid 
discharges because they are 
shallow or susceptible to rapid 
flow directly to rock, gravel or 
groundwater.

N
Minor Aquifer/High Leaching 
Potential
H3
Coarse textured or moderately 
shallow soils which readily 
transmit non-adsorbed pollutants 
and liquid discharges but have 
some ability to attenuate adsorbed 
pollutants because of their clay or 
organic matter content.

6.4 Areas benefiting from Flood Defences
Are there any areas benefiting from Flood Defences within 250m of the study site?
No
6.5 Areas benefiting from Flood Storage
Are there any areas used for Flood Storage within 250m of the study site?
No
6.6 Groundwater Flooding Susceptibility Areas
6.6.1 Are there any British Geological Survey groundwater flooding susceptibility areas within 50m of the 
boundary of the study site?
 
Yes
Does this relate to Clearwater Flooding or Superficial Deposits Flooding?
Superficial Deposits Flooding
Notes: Groundwater flooding may either be associated with shallow unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers 
which overlie unproductive aquifers (Superficial Deposits Flooding), or with unconfined aquifers (Clearwater 
Flooding).
6.6.2 What is the highest susceptibility to groundwater flooding in the search area based on the underlying 
geological conditions?
 
Potential at Surface
Where potential for groundwater flooding to occur at surface is indicated, this means that given the geological 
conditions in the area groundwater flooding hazard should be considered in all land-use planning decisions. It is 
recommended that other relevant information e.g. records of previous incidence of groundwater flooding, 
rainfall, property type, and land drainage information be investigated in order to establish relative, but not 
absolute, risk of groundwater flooding.
6.7 Groundwater Flooding Confidence Areas
What is the British Geological Survey confidence rating in this result?
High
Notes: Groundwater flooding is defined as the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface or the rising of 
groundwater into man-made ground under conditions where the normal range of groundwater  levels is 
exceeded.
The confidence rating is on a threefold scale - Low, Moderate and High. This provides a relative indication of the 
BGS confidence in the accuracy of the susceptibility result for groundwater flooding. This is based on the 
amount and precision of the information used in the assessment. In areas with a relatively lower level of 
confidence the susceptibility result should be treated with more caution. In other areas with higher levels of 
confidence the susceptibility result can be used with more confidence.

8. Natural Hazards
Findings
8.1 Detailed BGS GeoSure Data
BGS GeoSure Data has been searched to 50m. The data is included in tabular format. If you require further 
information on geology and ground stability, please obtain a  GroundSure GeoInsight, available from  our 
website. The following information has been found:
8.1.1 Shrink Swell
What is the maximum Shrink-Swell** hazard rating identified on the study site?
Very Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Ground conditions predominantly low plasticity. No special actions required to avoid problems due to shrink-swell clays. No special ground 
investigation required, and increased construction costs or increased financial risks are unlikely due to potential problems with shrink-swell clays.
8.1.2 Landslides
What is the maximum Landslide* hazard rating identified on the study site?
Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Possibility of slope instability problems after major changes in ground conditions. Consideration should be given to stability if changes to drainage 
or excavations take place. Possible increase in construction cost to reduce potential slope stability problems. Existing property  no significant 
�
increase in insurance risk due to natural slope instability problems.
8.1.3 Soluble Rocks
What is the maximum Soluble Rocks* hazard rating identified on the study site?
Null - Negligible
Soluble rocks are not present in the search area. No special actions required to avoid problems due to soluble 
rocks. No special ground investigation required, and increased construction costs or increased financial risks 
are unlikely due to potential problems with soluble rocks.

8.1.4 Compressible Ground
What is the maximum Compressible Ground* hazard rating identified on the study site?
High
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Very significant potential for compressibility problems. Avoid large differential loadings of ground. Do not drain or de-water ground near the 
property without technical advice. For new build  consider possibility of compressible ground in ground investigation, construction and building 
�
design. Consider effects of groundwater changes. Construction may not be possible at economic cost. For existing property  probable increase in 
�
insurance risk from compressibility especially if water conditions or loading of the ground change significantly.
8.1.5 Collapsible Rocks
What is the maximum Collapsible Rocks* hazard rating identified on the study site?
Very Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Deposits with potential to collapse when loaded and saturated are unlikely to be present. No special ground investigation required or increased 
construction costs or increased financial risk due to potential problems with collapsible deposits.
8.1.6 Running Sand
What is the maximum Running Sand** hazard rating identified on the study site?
Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Possibility of running sand problems after major changes in ground conditions. Normal maintenance to avoid leakage of water-bearing services or 
water bodies (ponds, swimming pools) should reduce likelihood of problems due to running sand. For new build  consider possibility of running sand
�
 
into trenches or excavations if water table is high or sandy strata are exposed to water. Avoid concentrated water inputs to site. Unlikely to be an 
increase in construction costs due to potential for running sand. For existing property  no significant increase in insurance risk due to running sand 
�
problems is likely.

Low
Possibility of running sand problems after major changes in ground conditions. Normal 
maintenance to avoid leakage of water-bearing services or water bodies (ponds, 
swimming pools) should reduce likelihood of problems due to running sand. For new 
build - consider possibility of running sand into trenches or excavations if water table is 
high or sandy strata are exposed to water. Avoid concentrated water inputs to site. 
Unlikely to be an increase in construction costs due to potential for running sand. For 
existing property - no significant increase in insurance risk due to running sand 
problems is likely.

Information from the Coal Authority
Underground coal mining
Past
The property is in the likely zone of influence from workings in 3 seams of coal at shallow to 380m
depth, and last worked in 1986.
Present
The property is not in the likely zone of influence of any present underground coal workings.
Future
The property is not in an area for which the Coal Authority is determining whether to grant a
licence to remove coal using underground methods.
The property is not in an area for which a licence has been granted to remove or otherwise work
coal using underground methods.
The property is not in an area that is likely to be affected at the surface from any planned future
workings.
However, reserves of coal exist in the local area which could be worked at some time in the
future.
No notice of the risk of the land being affected by subsidence has been given under section 46 of
the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991.
Mine entries

Within, or within 20 metres of, the boundary of the property there are 2 mine entries, the
approximate positions of which are shown on the attached plan.
There is no record of what steps, if any, have been taken to treat the mine entries.
Records may be incomplete. Consequently, there may exist in the local area mine entries of
which the Coal Authority has no knowledge.
For an additional fee, the Coal Authority will provide a supplementary Mine Entry Interpretive
Report.  The report will provide a separate assessment for the mine entry (entries) referred to in
this report. It will give details based on information in the Coal Authority's possession, together
with an opinion on the likelihood of mining subsidence damage arising from ground movement as
a consequence of the existence of the mine entry/entries. It will also give details of the remedies
available for subsidence damage where the mine entry was sunk in connection with coal mining.
Please note that it may not be possible to produce a report if the main building to the property
cannot be identified from Coal Authority plans (ie. for development sites and new build).
For further advice on how to order this additional information visit www.groundstability.com or
telephone 0845 7626 848.
Coal mining geology
The Authority is not aware of any evidence of damage arising due to geological faults or other
lines of weakness that have been affected by coal mining.
Opencast coal mining
Past
The property is not within the boundary of an opencast site from which coal has been removed
by opencast methods.
Present
The property does not lie within 200 metres of the boundary of an opencast site from which coal
is being removed by opencast methods.
Future
The property is not within 800 metres of the boundary of an opencast site for which the Coal
Authority is determining whether to grant a licence to remove coal by opencast methods.
The property is not within 800 metres of the boundary of an opencast site for which a licence to
remove coal by opencast methods has been granted.
Coal mining subsidence
A damage notice or claim for alleged subsidence damage was made in November 1996 for
ABERGELLI FARM, FELINDRE, SWANSEA, SA5 7NN. However, the claim was rejected.
There is no current Stop Notice delaying the start of remedial works or repairs to the property.
A damage notice or claim for alleged subsidence damage was made in June 1995 for
ABERGELLI FARM, FELINDRE, SWANSEA, WEST GLAMORGAN, SA5 7NN. However, the
claim was rejected.
There is no current Stop Notice delaying the start of remedial works or repairs to the property.
The Authority is not aware of any request having been made to carry out preventive works before
coal is worked under section 33 of the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991.
If further subsidence damage claims information is required in addition to that provided in this
report, the Authority need to manually search their records. For further advice on how to order this
additional information visit www.groundstability.com or telephone 0845 7626 848.
Mine gas
There is no record of a mine gas emission requiring action by the Coal Authority within the
boundary of the property.
Hazards related to coal mining

Industry Act 1975/Coal Industry Act 1994.
Comments on Coal Authority information
The attached plan shows the approximate location of the disused mine entry/entries referred to in
this report.  For reasons of clarity, mine entry symbols may not be drawn to the same scale as the
plan.
Property owners have the benefit of statutory protection (under the Coal Mining Subsidence act
1991*). This contains provision for the making good, to the reasonable satisfaction of the owner,
of physical damage from disused coal mine workings including disused coal mine entries.  A
leaflet setting out the rights and the obligations of either the Coal Authority or other responsible
persons under the 1991 Act can be obtained by telephoning 0845 762 6848 or online at
www.coal.decc.gov.uk/en/coal/cms/services/claims.
If you wish to discuss the relevance of any of the information contained in this report you should
seek the advice of a qualified mining engineer or surveyor.  If you or your adviser wish to examine
the source plans from which the information has been taken these are normally available at our
Mansfield office, free of charge, by prior appointment, telephone 01623 637235.  Should you or
your adviser wish to carry out any physical investigations that may enter, disturb or interfere with
any disused mine entry the prior permission of the owner must be sought.  For coal mine entries
the owner will normally be the Coal Authority.
The Coal Authority, regardless of responsibility and in conjunction with other public bodies,
provide an emergency call out facility in coalfield areas to assess the public safety implications of
mining features (including disused mine entries).  Our emergency telephone number at all times is
01623 646333.
*Note, this Act does not apply where coal was worked or gotten by virtue of the grant of a gale in
the Forest of Dean, or any other part of the Hundred of St. Briavels in the county of Gloucester.
In view of the mining circumstances a prudent developer would seek appropriate technical advice
before any works are undertaken.
Therefore if  development proposals are being considered, technical advice relating to both the
investigation of coal and former coal mines and their treatment should be obtained before
beginning work on site. All proposals should apply good engineering practice developed for
mining areas. No development should be undertaken that intersects, disturbs or interferes with
any coal or mines of coal without the permission of the Coal Authority. Developers should be
aware that the investigation of coal seams/former mines of coal may have the potential to
generate and/or displace underground gases and these risks both under and adjacent to the
development should be fully considered in developing any proposals.  The need for effective
measures to prevent gases entering into public properties either during investigation or after
development also needs to be assessed and properly addressed.  This is necessary due to the
public safety implications of any development in these circumstances.
