Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals from Forest Land, 
Woodlands, and Urban Trees in the United States, 1990-2018
Introduction
As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United States has 
been reporting an economy-wide Inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals since the mid-1990s (US 
EPA 2020). Forest land, harvested wood products (HWPs), and urban trees within the land sector collectively represent 
the largest net carbon (C) sink in the United States, offsetting more than 11 percent of total GHG emissions annually 
(US EPA 2020). Estimates of GHG emissions and removals are compiled by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Forest Service researchers and are based primarily on National Forest Inventory (NFI) data collected and maintained by 
the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program within the USDA Forest Service. This report—the second in a new 
series of annual updates—provides an overview of the status and trends of GHG emissions and removals from forest 
land, woodlands in the grassland category, HWPs, and urban trees in settlements in the United States from 1990 to 
2018. The estimates for the United States summarized here are based on the compilation reported in the Land Use, 
Land-Use Change, and Forestry chapter of the US EPA (2020) submission to the UNFCCC. New in this report, most of 
the national scale estimates are also reported by individual U.S. state (Fig. 1) and are available online for the entire 
1990-2018 time series (see appendix).
Figure 1.—Estimated annual emissions and removals from forest land remaining forest land by carbon pool for 
each of the conterminous 48 states in 2018 (MMT CO2 Eq.). Note that points and confidence intervals (95 
percent) reflect net flux for all carbon pools in each state. Negative estimates indicate net C uptake (i.e., a net 
removal of C from the atmosphere).

Forest Carbon Cycle
Carbon is continuously cycled among ecosystem pools 
and the atmosphere as a result of biogeochemical 
processes in forests (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration, 
decomposition, and disturbances such as fires or pest 
outbreaks) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., 
harvesting, thinning, and replanting). As trees 
photosynthesize and grow, C is removed from the 
atmosphere and stored in living tree biomass. As trees 
die and otherwise deposit litter and debris on the 
forest floor, C is released to the atmosphere and is also 
transferred to the litter, dead wood, and soil pools by 
organisms that facilitate decomposition. 
The net change in forest C is not equivalent to the net 
flux between forests and the atmosphere because 
timber harvests do not result in an immediate flux of 
all harvested biomass C to the atmosphere. Instead, 
following harvesting a portion of the C stored in wood 
is transferred to a "product pool." Once in a product 
pool, the C is emitted over time as carbon dioxide 
(CO2) from decomposition and as CO2, methane 
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), 
and other nitrogen oxides (NOx) when the wood 
product combusts. The rate of emission varies 
considerably among different product pools. 
Total Emissions and Removals
Forest land, HWPs, woodlands, and urban trees in settlements collectively represent a net GHG sink over the UNFCCC 
reporting period, with interannual variability driven, in large part, by natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., 
wildfire, harvesting), land conversions, and changes in HWPs in use (Table 1.; US EPA 2020).  In 2018, forest land, 
HWPs, woodlands, and urban trees in settlements collectively represented an estimated net uptake of 752.9 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2 Eq.). The category “forest land remaining forest land” was the 
largest net sink in the land sector, with an estimated uptake of 564.5 MMT CO2 Eq. Conversions from forest land were 
the largest source of emissions within the categories included in this report, with estimated emissions of 127.4 MMT 
CO2 Eq. (Table 1; US EPA 2020). 
For estimating C stocks or stock change (flux), C in 
forest ecosystems can be divided into the following 
five storage pools (IPCC 2006):

Aboveground biomass—all living biomass
above the soil including stem, stump,
branches, bark, seeds, and foliage. This pool
includes live understory.

Belowground biomass—all living biomass of
coarse living roots greater than 2 millimeters
(mm) diameter.

Dead wood—all nonliving woody biomass
either standing, lying on the ground (but not
including litter), or in the soil.

Litter—the litter, fumic, and humic layers,
and all nonliving biomass with a diameter
less than 7.5 centimeters (cm) at transect
intersection, lying on the ground.

Soil organic C (SOC)—all organic material
in soil to a depth of 1 meter but excluding the
coarse roots of the belowground pools.
In addition, two harvested wood pools are included 
when estimating C flux:

Harvested wood products (HWP) in use.

HWP in solid waste disposal sites (SWDS).

Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Harvested Wood Products
Within the “forest land remaining forest land” category, aboveground live biomass is the largest contributor to the net 
uptake over the reporting period, followed by belowground live biomass and dead wood (Table 2). Harvested wood 
products in use and in solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) are also an important contributor to the net sink in the land sector, 
and 2018 estimates for both pools increased from previous years.

Table 3.—Carbon stocks in forest land remaining forest land and harvested wood pools (MMT C)
a For details on these estimates and how they were compiled see US EPA 2020.  
Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Forest C stock estimates include all forest land remaining forest land in the conterminous 48 states and Alaska. 
Forest ecosystem C stocks do not include U.S. Territories because managed forest land for U.S. Territories is not currently included in Section 6.1 Representation of the 
U.S. Land Base. Forest ecosystem C stocks also do not include Hawaii because there is not sufficient NFI data to support inclusion at this time. Forest ecosystem C 
stocks on managed forest land in Alaska were compiled using the gain-loss method as described in Annex 3.13. Harvested wood product stocks include exports, even if 
the logs are processed in other countries, and excludes imports. Harvested wood estimates are based on results from annual surveys and models. Totals may not sum due 
to independent rounding. Population estimates compiled using FIA data are assumed to represent stocks as of January 1 of the inventory year. Flux is the net annual 
change in stock. Thus, flux estimates for 2018 require C stocks for 2018 and 2019.
Carbon stock estimates for forest ecosystem and harvested wood C storage pools are presented in Table 3. Together, the 
estimated aboveground biomass and soil C pools account for a large proportion of total forest ecosystem C stocks. By 
maintaining current harvesting practices and regeneration activities on these forested lands, along with continued input of 
harvested products into the HWP pool, C stocks in forests are likely to continue to increase in the near term, though 
possibly at a lower rate. Because most of the timber harvested from U.S. forest land is used in wood products and many 
discarded wood products are disposed of in SWDS rather than by incineration, significant quantities of C in harvested 
wood are transferred to these long-term storage pools rather than being released rapidly to the atmosphere (Skog 2008).

Forest Land Conversions
Land use conversions to and from forest land result in substantial emissions and removals each year. In this section all 
emissions and removals included for land conversions to and from forest land, as reported in US EPA (2020), are 
included in Table 4. Forest land conversion to settlements was the largest source of emissions in the conversion 
categories while cropland conversion to forest land resulted in the largest annual uptake. Considering all forest land 
conversions included in the US EPA (2020) report, over the reporting period there have been net emissions each year, 
with estimated net emissions of 16.7 MMT CO2 Eq. for the most recent year.

Land Area
The land area included in the US EPA (2020) report includes lands directly influenced by human intervention. Direct 
intervention occurs mostly in areas accessible to human activity and includes altering or maintaining the condition of the 
land to produce commercial or noncommercial products or services; to serve as transportation corridors or locations for 
buildings, landfills, or other developed areas for commercial or noncommercial purposes; to extract resources or facilitate 
acquisition of resources; or to provide social functions for personal, community, or societal objectives where these areas 
are readily accessible to society. Forest Inventory and Analysis data from each of the conterminous 48 states and Alaska 
comprise an estimated 280 million hectares (ha) of forest land that are considered managed and are included in this report 
along with an additional 10 million ha of non-forest land converted to forest land. Some differences exist in forest land 
area estimates in the latest update to the Resources Planning Act Assessment (Oswalt et al. 2019) and the forest land area 
estimates included in the US EPA (2020) report, which are based on annual FIA data through 2018 for all states (USDA 
Forest Service 2019). These differences are due, in large part, to the separation of land categories and the managed land 
definition used in the US EPA (2020) report (Nelson et al. 2020). Sufficient annual inventory data are not yet available 
for Hawaii, but estimates of these areas are included in Oswalt et al. (2019). Even though Hawaii and U.S. Territories 
have relatively small areas of forest land that may not substantially influence the overall C budget for forest land, these 
regions will be added to the forest C estimates as sufficient data become available. Agroforestry systems that meet the 
definition of forest land are also not currently included in the US EPA (2020) report since they are not explicitly 
inventoried (i.e., they are classified as agroforestry system) by either the FIA program or the Natural Resources Inventory 
of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Woodland area is included in the “grassland remaining 
grassland” and “land converted to grassland” categories and is not explicitly separated in the US EPA (2020) report as a 
subcategory of grasslands. Combined, forest land and woodland area accounts for more than 311 million ha (Table 5).

Planned Improvements
Planned improvements to estimation and reporting include 
the following general topics: development of a more robust 
estimation and reporting system, individual C pool 
estimation, coordination with other land-use categories, 
and annual inventory data incorporation. Research is 
underway to leverage auxiliary information (i.e., remotely 
sensed information) to operate at finer spatial and temporal 
scales. As in past submissions, emissions and removals 
associated with natural (e.g., wildfire, insects, and disease) 
and human (e.g., harvesting) disturbances are implicitly 
included in the report given the design of the annual NFI, 
but are not explicitly estimated. In addition to integrating 
auxiliary information into the estimation framework, 
alternative estimators are also being evaluated that will 
eliminate latency in population estimates from the NFI, 
improve annual estimation and characterization of 
interannual variability, facilitate attribution of fluxes to 
particular activities, and allow for easier harmonization of 
NFI data with auxiliary data products. There are also 
investments being made to leverage state-level wood 
products and harvest information to allow for the 
disaggregation of HWPs estimates at the state level. 
Collectively these improvements are expected to reduce 
uncertainties in the estimates at the national and state 
scales and facilitate entity-level estimation and reporting.

Below are summary statistics from the compilation 
of the forest land, woodlands, HWPs, and urban trees 
in settlements in the US EPA (2020) report.

Forest land, HWPs, and urban trees in settlements
collectively offset more than 11 percent (752.9
MMT CO2 Eq.) of total GHG emissions annually,
or 14 percent of CO2 emissions.

Forest land accounts for more than 95 percent of
the net C sink within the land sector.

Live vegetation in forests and urban trees account
for nearly 80 percent of the C sink strength.

Land conversions to and from forest land
continue to result in net emissions (16.7 MMT
CO2 Eq.).

More than 56 percent of all carbon in forest
ecosystems is stored in the soil with small stock
changes annually.

Carbon storage in HWPs continues to increase
annually since the Great Recession.
