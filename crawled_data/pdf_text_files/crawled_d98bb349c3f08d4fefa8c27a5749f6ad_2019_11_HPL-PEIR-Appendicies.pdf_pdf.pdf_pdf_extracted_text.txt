The use of atmospheric dispersion modelling
is welcomed. The SoS notes the intention to
discuss the exact study area and detailed
methodology with statutory consultees. The
SoS recommends that both the assessment
methodology and the sensitive receptors are
agreed in consultation with Rhondda Cynon
Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC),
Natural Resources Wales
(NRW) and the Brecon Beacons National Park
Authority (BBNPA).
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the
comments from the BBNPA (see Appendix 2)
on the need to include methane in the air
quality assessment.
It can be confirmed that atmospheric
dispersion modelling has been used in this
assessment. RCTBC, NRW and BBNP have
all been contacted to discuss the requirements
of the air quality assessment.
Further correspondence from RCTBC is
outlined in this table.
Discussion of the ‘relevant substances’ is
included in the PEIR.  Methane will not be
considered further in the assessment.
Methane will only be produced if the plant is
not operating properly. However, if this is the
case it will be shut down immediately. No
methane will be produced during normal
operation. No methane limits are given in the
latest Bref Guidance Notes.

It is noted that the air quality modelling and
assessment will consider impacts at European
and nationally designated wildlife sites and
other ecological sites within 10km of the
proposed development. The Applicant’s
attention is drawn to the comments from NRW
(see Appendix 2) on the need to ensure that
all the relevant wildlife sites and habitats are
considered within the air
quality assessment.
It can be confirmed that all relevant ecological
sites will be considered within the Air Quality
Assessment which will follow EA/NRW
guidance for dispersion modelling with regards
to the selection of receptors.

The assessment should take account of the air
emissions from the proposed development
and emissions related to increased vehicular
movements associated with the proposed
development. Such information should also
inform the ecological assessment.
It can be confirmed that vehicle emissions will
be taken into consideration in both the air
quality assessment and ecological
assessment.

Changes in air quality and dust levels should
be considered not only on site but also off site,
including along access roads, local footpaths
and other Public Rights of Way (PROW). The
Applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments
from NRW (see Appendix 2). on the need to
give particular consideration to the impacts of
dust on habitats and designated wildlife sites.
It can be confirmed that air quality impacts
during both construction and operation will be
considered for both on-site and off-site
receptors as per the guidance of both the EA
(as above) and the IAQM Guidelines for the
assessment of impacts of construction dust.

The SoS notes the references to embedded
mitigation measures that will be employed
during the construction phase of the project in
addition to any project specific measures that
may be required. The SoS advises that the ES
must make it clear what mitigation measures
are proposed, how they will be delivered, how
effective they will be and what the residual
effects would be.
It can be confirmed that mitigation measures
will be set out in detail for each impact topic,
as well as any residual impacts remaining
after mitigation.  In accordance with the IAQM
Guidelines, appropriate mitigation will be
defined by the relevant sections of the “The
control of dust and emissions from
construction and demolition – Best Practice
Guidance” (Greater London Authority, 2006)

Consideration should be given to monitoring
dust complaints.
A Construction Environmental Management
Plan (CEMP) will be drafted as an outline as
an Appendix to the ES and then prepared in
detail prior to construction. This will set out
requirements for dust monitoring and
mitigation during construction which will be
based on the assessed level of risk to
identified receptors, as per the IAQM
Guidelines.

The ES should also address the inter-
relationships with other topics within the ES
particularly ecology and water quality. The
Applicant should also consider whether air
quality and health issues should be addressed
within the ES. The Applicant’s attention is
drawn to the advice from Public Health
England in Appendix 2. The SoS notes that a
worst case assessment of stack
height in respect of air quality may not
constitute a worst case assessment in respect
of other topic areas.
The inter-relationships between air quality and
other topic areas will be fully explored as
required.  Ecological impacts will be assessed
in accordance with (amongst others) the EA
guidance “AQTAG 06 - Technical Guidance on
detailed modelling approach for an appropriate
assessment for emissions to air” (2010).
A separate public health section is included in
the PEIR and will be finalised for the ES.
Worst case scenarios will be addressed for
each topic area and it is recognised that these
‘worst cases’ may differ between topics.

BBNP
Appendix 2
The reference to BBNP as a receptor is
welcomed. However, given that there will be
emissions of air pollutants from the power
plant, even if they are less than those from
coal fired plant, the BBNPA believe that
emissions of CO2, NOx and Methane should
be scrutinised carefully. However low they
may be, they will still contribute to the
degradation of local air quality and continue to
add to the cumulative deposition that has
occurred and is still occurring.
CO2 is not relevant with regards to air quality
in respect of protection of human health and it
is assumed that this is a typo intended to refer
to carbon monoxide (CO).
As per our response to PINS Paragraph 3.20,
atmospheric dispersion modelling of ‘relevant
substances’ (which are likely to be CO and
NOx) will be considered. However, methane
will not, as outlined in our response to the
response from PINS at Paragraph 3.20.

In relation to Paragraph 5.3.2, the EIA should
also consider the release of methane because
its contributions to air quality and greenhouse
gases. Methane, a primary component of
natural gas, can also be emitted into the air
when natural gas is not burned completely or
from leaks in the system.
Combustion in gas turbines usually takes
place at between 200-300 per cent excess
oxygen providing conditions were incomplete
combustion is negligible.  As above, methane
will not be considered further as if there any
operational issue with the plants operation; it
will be automatically shut down, preventing the
release of any methane.
Section 6.4 –

Methodology

Criteria
It is recognised that this project on it’s own
and in combination with other projects in the
vicinity has the potential to further impact upon
the degradation of sensitive receptors in the
area including within the National Park. It
should be recognised that some receptors are
already at or nearing capacity and thus any
additional pollutants must be heavily mitigated.
The Scoping report is somewhat conflicting in
this regard as the project description in
Chapter 3 sets out that no flue gas cleaning
equipment will be used, whereas paragraph
5.3.30 sets out that flue gas cleaning
equipment will be used. These conflicting
statements cast doubts over the potential
magnitude of air quality impacts of this
development and therefore needs to be
formally clarified. Notwithstanding this, it is
requested as part of the mitigation measures
that an air quality monitoring network is set up
to measure the in-combination actual impacts
of the development and other developments
within the vicinity when operational on
ecosystems and communities upwind of the
site within the National Park.
It can be confirmed that the potential impacts
on sensitive receptors will be fully assessed.
The Project will incorporate primary control
measures for the emissions of ‘relevant
substances’ to within the emissions levels
associated with the Best Available
Techniques.  As such, secondary control
measures such as bespoke flue gas cleaning
equipment will be required.  The EIA will
consider the significance of the potential worst
case impacts to all identified receptors within
the ‘zone of influence’ of the emissions to air.
The need for subsequent monitoring is
considered unlikely at this stage however will
form part of the in-going consultation
discussions with relevant stakeholders.

is considered as best practice in undertaking
these types of assessments.

As stated in 5.3.15 Horizontal Guidance Note
H1 Annex (f): Air Emissions will be used then
a screening distance of 10km is required.
Cwm Cadlan SAC is approximately 3km to the
northeast of this development and must be
included in the assessment process. We
agree that the impact of nitrogen deposition on
the features of the designated sites will need
to be assessed.
In accordance with the relevant guidance
notes, all EU designated sites within 10 km,
such as the SAC, will be included as sensitive
receptors.  In addition, all UK designated sites
(e.g. SSSIs) will be assessed within 2 km of
the Project.
Section 6.6 –
Baseline
Conditions and
Receptors
The majority of literature indicates that large
dust particles (>30�m) deposit within 100m of
source and deposit quite quickly, whereas
intermediate sized particles (10 – 30�m) are
likely to travel 200 – 500m and small particles
(<10�m) may travel 1000m from source and
deposit more slowly. Blaen Cynon SAC (also
designated Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI) is
approximately 400m from the edge of
development.
The assessment of dust associated with
construction works will be undertaken in
accordance with the IAQM Guidelines which
specifies ‘zones of influence’ based on the
types of receptor and the specific activities
that are anticipated.

For dust particles to become airborne the

>2mm/hour will reduce dust migration.
Conversely, precipitation rates <2mm/hr will
not discourage dust movement. Therefore, it is
important to determine how often the wind
speed is �5.3m/s with a rainfall of <2mm/hr in
the direction of the designated sites. From this
the rate of dust deposition (in g/m2/day) and
can be calculated and also how often it could
occur in the direction of the
designated sites.
and
Assessment
Criteria
The DMRB uses the volume of traffic as an
indicator of significance. This may be entirely
appropriate for determining nuisance to
humans but it is inappropriate for determining
the impact on sensitive habitats. It is the
pollution produced by the traffic that is of
concern rather than the volume of traffic,
though the two are correlated. We therefore
advise that NOx concentrations and nitrogen
deposition be assessed against the relevant
critical level and critical loads. This form of
assessment was completed recently for the
A465 dualling.
The DMRB methodology provides an estimate
of the contribution to annual mean ground
level concentrations of NOx/NO2 from traffic.
This contribution will, where appropriate, be
incorporated into the assessment of ecological
receptors based on the AQS Regulations and
the EA AQTAG Guidance (as above) which
will include NOx concentrations and nitrogen
deposition be assessed against the relevant
critical level and critical loads.

Please clarify the meaning of ‘base load’.
Worst case scenarios are usually assessed on
full load running continuously 24 hours per
day, 365 days per year. A realistic scenario
would be based on the expected actual
running of the installation. Please clarify the
meaning of ‘realistic worst case scenario’.
Base load does mean running continuously 24
hours per day, 365 days per year. Realistic
worst case scenario means that because the
plant could operate at any time during the
year, and could feasibly operate continuously,
this worst case has been assessed. In reality it
is unlikely that the plant will run continuously

We do not agree that dust is ‘unlikely to have

Comment acknowledged.
NRW assumes that construction dust will
primarily consist of cement dusts and, like
dusts in general, will affect vegetation by both
physical and chemical processes. Physically,
dust may cover the leaf surface and reduce
the amount of light available for
photosynthesis, or it may occlude stomata.
Occlusion may lead to increased resistance to
gas exchange, or may prevent full stomatal
closure, leading to water stress. Increased
transpiration is a common response to dust
exposure. Chemically, cement dusts are
strongly alkaline, and may have detrimental
effects on leaf surfaces. Infestation by pests
and pathogens is also likely to be enhanced.
A full assessment will be undertaken of
construction air quality which will include an
assessment of dust on sensitive ecological
receptors including sensitive areas of
vegetation. There are no areas of sensitive
vegetation within the site itself and mitigation
measures will be applied to limit dust
generation from the site.  Additionally, a
CEMP will be produced outlining the methods
of dust monitoring during construction.

Trees and woodlands receive greater
deposition of dust than adjacent short
vegetation because of increased air
turbulence. In extreme cases, dust deposition
may lead to tree death, but less severe
symptoms are changes in pigments, sugars,
and overall growth, detectable over a few km
from a major source (Mandre et al., 1999).
As above.
Indirect effects may be caused through the
soil, especially on acid soils, where the
cement dust can increase the pH and
available calcium, leading to changes in
vegetation composition. The subject has been
reviewed in depth by Farmer (1993).
As above.
Effects of cement dust have been observed for
deposition rates as low as 0.5 g/m2/day.
Often, deposition rates are not measured, and
exposure is judged by amounts retained on
leaves. Removal of dust from leaves by rain
however, varies very greatly among plant
species, from those that are ‘self-cleaning’ (the
lotus effect) to those that accumulate large
quantities. Most industrial processes are
regulated to prevent the emission of cement
dust.

The SoS notes that noise monitoring will be
undertaken to establish the baseline which will
then be used in a model, together with the
sound power levels of proposed plant.  Where
sound power levels are not available suitable
data will be substituted although a realistic
worst case scenario would always be
considered.
The SoS advises that the choice of data for
use in the model and the worst case scenario
must be clearly defined and justified in the ES.
If aspects of the project have not been fully
defined at the time of justification (such as the
choice of technology or electrical connection)
then the ES should cover each of the likely
scenarios.

The  SoS  advises  that  the  ES  must  make
it  clear  what  mitigation measures are
proposed, how they will be delivered, how
effective
They will be and what the residual effects
would be.
The ES should make clear which measures
are being proposed for the mitigation of  the
effects  of  the  project  and  which  are  being
proposed  as compensation where mitigation
is not possible.  Paragraph 5.5.29 appears to
confuse mitigation and compensation.

The  proposal  to  produce  a  Method
Statement  for  undertaking works within the
Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of Importance
for Nature Conservation  (SINC)  is
welcomed.
At  least  a  preliminary Method  Statement
should  be  attached  to  the  ES  to  provide
the
SoS with the confidence that any effects from
the project on the SINC will be adequately
addressed.

The SoS considers that there is potential for
the presence of EPS
Within the study area for the proposed
development.  Where  a potential risk to an
EPS is identified and before making a
decision to grant development consent the CA
must, amongst other things, address  the
derogation  tests  in  Regulation  53  of  the
Habitats Regulations.
Therefore  the  Applicant  may  wish  to
provide
information which will assist the decision
maker to meet this duty.
Where required  the  Applicant  should,  in
consultation  with  NRW, agree appropriate
requirements to secure necessary mitigation.

If the Applicant has concluded (in consultation
with NRW) that an EPS  licence  is  required
the  SoS  will  need  to  understand  whether
there  is  any  impediment  to  the  licence
being  granted.
It  would assist  the  examination  if  the

The SoS notes that the landscape
assessment will be undertaken using the
second edition of the ‘Guidelines for
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment’
(Landscape Institute and Institute of
Environmental Management).
The Applicant’s attention is drawn to the
recent publication of the third edition of the

3.61
The ES should identify landscape planning
designations, landscape character areas and
potentially sensitive receptors.
The choice of receptors should be explained
and justified in the ES. Reference to any
LANDMAP landscape character assessment
produced for the area is also recommended.
A preliminary assessment of landscape
character areas has been undertaken for the
PEIR. LANDMAP has been consulted and the
justification for receptors has been set out.
Section 11.6
3.62
The SoS advises that the assessment within
the ES must address the full range of visual
effects from the project, including the
construction and decommissioning phase.
Effects at night as well as during the day
should be addressed, particularly in view of
the Brecon Beacons National Park status as
an International Dark Sky Reserve.
Noted. The assessment of visual impacts is
still at an early stage, but this will be further
developed and refined as part of the ongoing

The landscape and visual assessment in the
scoping report refers to the Zone of
Theoretical Visibility (ZTV).
The SoS advises that the ES should describe
the methodology and model used, provide

Having regard to local topography, the ZTV
should seek to ensure that all potential
sensitive receptors are considered and
viewpoints are agreed with RCTCBC and
BBNPA.

The EIA should consider protected
landscapes in the vicinity of the proposals.
With respect to the Brecon Beacons National
Park this should also consider the statutory
purposes of the designation.
The landscape and visual impact assessment
(LVIA) should utilise appropriate viewpoints to
consider the impacts of the proposals on
these protected landscapes, particularly given
the potential for the proposals to be visible
from a wide area.
5.8.3 Introduction - Power Generation Plant
Much of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate,
although reasonably well assimilated by
blocks and belts of maturing woodland, is
highly visible in medium to long range views,
as a direct consequence of the pale colours of
the roof and wall cladding used on many of its
larger buildings, including apparently recent
developments.
Therefore, it will be essential that the LVIA
and CLVIA elements of the ES deal
comprehensively with this very important
aspect of the proposed development,
including the potential visual impacts of
reflective glazed and metallic surfaces and
their potential to exacerbate visual intrusion in
certain climatic conditions.
The PEIR has identified protected landscapes
within the vicinity of the Project and made a
preliminary assessment of how these
landscapes may be impacted by the Project.
These protected landscapes will be taken into
consideration when determining locations for
photomontages.
A preliminary assessment of the potential
landscape and visual impacts of the Electrical
and Gas Connection is presented in the ES.

This factor is especially important for chimney
stacks and other tall structures. Potential
effects of any proposed materials and finishes
will need to be fully assessed.
5.8.4 to 5.8.6 Introduction - Gas and Electricity
Connections
We note that it is not anticipated the
connections would give rise to 'significant
visual impacts', since they would be mostly
placed underground, although the report
states in 5.8.6 that there is an option to use an
overhead connection for electricity.
We would advise that there is the potential for
significant landscape and visual effects arising
during the construction stage of these works.
In addition, there are potentially significant
adverse cumulative landscape and visual
effects in the operational stage of the project
in the event of an overhead electricity
connection being constructed.
These would be likely to occur in combination
with the existing and proposed high-voltage
overhead lines infrastructure in the locality -
especially the new grid connection and sub-
station to be constructed to serve the
consented Pen y Cymoedd wind farm.
5.8.8 Introduction - Electrical Connection
NRW welcomes the fact that 'a full visual
impact assessment of this infrastructure will
be carried out
following guidelines set out in EN-1 and EN-5.'

5.8.10 Baseline - Power Generation Plant
In the scoping report it is noted that the
Brecon Beacons National Park (BBNP) would
be 'situated approximately 0.3km to the north
of the proposed Power Generation Plant site
at its closest point.' NRW agrees that the
BBNP rural setting and protected landscape is
a major landscape receptor and we would add
that the potential impacts upon it are
significant.
However, we disagree with the implication that
the presence of the Pen y Cymoedd wind farm
on the
higher ground 5km beyond the industrial
developments to the south has the effect of
degrading the local baseline landscape
condition. We would comment on two specific
matters in this regard:
- The stated area of 46.8 km2 of the Pen y
Cymoedd wind farm is not seen in full from
this location.
- There will be turbines visible above a
proportion of the ridge forming the southern
horizon, but this is only a small proportion of
the total area of the wind farm, so the scale
argument is misleading.
- Views from the high ground on the ridge -
including the promoted viewpoint car park
above Craig y Llyn on the A4061 Treherbert to
Rhigos mountain road have the turbines
behind and therefore not in the view; so the
Hirwaun Power Project PEIR Appendices

cumulative landscape and visual effects of the
proposed Power Generation Plant and
associated electricity grid connection
infrastructure are potentially significant in
views northwards towards the BBNP, which
forms the northern horizon and the land
backdrop to the Hirwaun Industrial Estate.
To have regard for wider enjoyment of the
countryside the LVIA and CLVIA documents
will need to address potential impacts upon
views towards the BBNP from the higher
ground to the south.
This should consider, in particular promoted
viewpoint areas easily accessible by the public
with a wide range of levels of personal mobility
in addition to Open Access Land as well as
land within identified Special Landscape areas
in the wider locality.
5.8.13 Baseline - Electricity Grid Connection
In the scoping report it is written that, in the
event of an overhead line grid connection
being implemented, 'the visual impact would
be considerably greater, and it would be likely
be visible from number of viewpoints'. We note
that no supporting text is provided to either
qualify or clarify this statement and no
viewpoints are described. The viewpoints to
be used in the LVIA and CLVIA should take
account of this potential impact.
5.8.18 Assessment - Power Generation Plant

Historic Interest in Wales in the Planning and
Development Process.
5.8.21 Assessment – Power Generation Plant
NRW welcomes the intention to produce a
Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) Plan as
part of the assessment. We would suggest
that the minimum radius for the ZTV should be
7.5km from the edge of the proposed Power
Generation Plant site.
This plan should indicate the differences in
theoretical visibility for a 30-metre and a 90-
metre high chimney stack. We would also
expect the assessment of the scheme to
comment upon the potential for enhanced
visual effects arising from vapour plumes
issuing from stacks during particular
atmospheric conditions.
5.8.24 to 5.8.27 Assessment – Power
Generation Plant NRW considers the list of
viewpoints provided to be inadequate;
viewpoints relevant to the remit of both NRW
and the BBNPA will need to be agreed with
each of the organisations prior to the
commencement of the assessment work. We

suggest that the starting point for these
discussions should be the viewpoints used for
the LVIA and CLVIA for the nearby
'Enviroparks' scheme.
With regard to photomontages, we consider
that it is premature to suggest that 'up to six
photomontages would be produced to
illustrate the development from key views'
would be adequate or reasonable without
further dialogue with NRW and BBNPA. The
precise number and location of the viewpoints
from which photomontages will be produced
should be agreed between the relevant
parties.

sufficient information for PHE to fully assess the
potential impact of the development on public health.
PHE will only consider information contained or
referenced in a separate section of the ES
summarising the impact of the proposed development
on public health:
Summarising risk assessments, proposed mitigation
measures, and residual impacts.  This section should
summarise key information and conclusions relating
to human health impacts contained in other sections
of the application (e.g. in the separate sections
dealing with: air quality, emissions to water, waste,
contaminated land etc) without undue duplication.
Compliance with the requirements of national policy
statements and relevant guidance and standards
should be highlighted.
It is not PHE’s role to undertake these assessments
on behalf of promoters as this would conflict with
PHE’s role as an impartial and independent body.
The ES should clearly identify the developments
location and distance from the development of off-site
human receptors that may be affected by emissions
from, or activities at, the development.  Off-site
human receptors may include people living in
residential premises; people working in commercial,

We would expect the promoter to follow best practice
guidance during all phases from construction to
decommissioning to ensure appropriate measures
are in place to mitigate any potential impact on health
from emissions (point source, fugitive and traffic
related). An effective construction environmental
management plan (CEMP) (and Decommissioning
Environmental Management Plan (DEMP)) will help
provide reassurance that activities are well managed.
The promoter should ensure that there are robust
mechanisms in place to respond to any complaints of
traffic-related pollution, during construction,
operation, and decommissioning of the facility.
An outline CEMP will be produced as
part of the final DCO documentation.

Amongst other permits and consents; the
development will require an environmental permit
from the environment agency to operate (under the
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales)
Regulations 2010).  Therefore the installation will
need to comply with the requirements of best
available techniques (BAT).  PHE is a consultee for
bespoke environmental permit applications and will
respond separately to any such consultation
Noted, The EP application has not yet

Annex 1
The points below are cross-cutting and should be
considered when undertaking a human health risk
assessment:
� 
The promoter should consider including
chemical abstract service (CAS) numbers
alongside chemical names, where referenced
in the ES
� 
Where available, the most recent United
Kingdom standards or the appropriate media
(e.g. air, water, and/soil) and health-based
guideline values should be used when
quantifying the risk to human health from
chemical pollutants. Where UK standards or
guideline values are not available, those
recommended by the European Union or
World Health Organisation can be used.
� 
When assessing the human health risk of a
chemical emitted from a facility of operation,
the background exposure to the chemical
from other sources should be taken into
account
� 
When quantitatively assessing the health risk
of genotoxic and carcinogenic chemical
pollutants PHE does not favour the use of
mathematical models to extrapolate from

The SoS notes that the archaeological
investigations will be based on a Desk Based
Assessment (DBA); intrusive investigations
will
be considered if the DBA suggests they are
required and in consultation with the
Glamorgan and Gwent Archaeological Trust
(GGAT)and CADW.
The ES should confirm the role of GGAT, and
whether they are acting on behalf of RCTCBC
and BBNPA. If this is not the case then the
SoS recommends that these bodies are
also consulted on the approach that should be
used for archaeological assessment.
It is noted that the Scoping Report states that
land affected by the gas and electrical
connections is less likely to be disturbed by
past activities on the site than the land in the
industrial estate. The SoS advises that these
areas should be subject to detailed
assessment if necessary.
A DBA has been completed, the scope of
which has been agreed with GGAT. GGAT
are independent of BBNPA but oversee
archaeological works undertaken in RCTCBC.
As part of the DBA, a mitigation strategy has
been suggested. However, this is yet to be
agreed with GGAT and BBNPA.

be addressed in the ES. The Applicant’s
attention is drawn to the comments from
BBPNA in Appendix 2 on the need to fully
consider the various statutory and non-
statutory historic monuments and landscapes.
3.82
The Scoping Report states (paragraph
5.11.27) that an initial study will be
undertaken making reference to desk-based
research and the Zone of Theoretical
Visibility. However paragraph 5.11.29
states that the search area for historic assets
will be limited to 5 km from the centre of the
proposed Power Generation Plant. The ES
should clearly explain what approach has
been used and justify
the extent of the search area.
The DBA covered a 1km study area from the
Project Site, whilst the setting impacts will
look at assets within a 5km study area
including a ZTV. This will aid the assessment
of the settings of the heritage assets.
Section 14.4
3.83
The ES should identify the names and
characteristics of the important heritage
assets that could be affected by the proposed
development.  Any cultural heritage or
archaeological features likely to be affected,
directly or indirectly, by the project should be
clearly identified in the plans of the ES. This
should include assets considered to be of
national, regional or local importance.
This has been provided in the PEIR.

The SoS advises that the ES must make it
clear what mitigation measures are proposed,
how they will be delivered, how effective
they will be and what the residual effects
would be.

measures has been outlined in the PEIR. This
will be further refined as the EIA progresses.

The proposal has the potential to affect the
setting of archaeological resources within the
BBNP, therefore the assessment o the
potential impacts of the development on the
setting of a variety of heritage asset types,
including a 5km theoretical zone of visibility is
welcomed.
The 5km zone would include the
archaeological significant area of Mynydd-y-
Glog: an area with a proliferation of Bronze
Age ritual activity including round cairns and
ring cairns, as well as later activity including
medieval and industrial activity. The
archaeological significance of Mynydd-y-Glog
is highlighted by the concentration of
scheduled ancient monuments in close
proximity to each other on the mountain.

the proposed development may potentially
impact upon the setting of and views from the
registered historic landscape as a heritage

As well as assessing the impact of the
proposed development on the setting of the
heritage assets (designated and
Undesignated) within the Brecon Beacons

The SoS recommends that the types of jobs
generated should be considered in the context
of the available work force in the area, this
applies equally to the construction and
operational stages.
The socio-economic baseline presents a
detailed examination of the labour market
context.  This examines the workforce profile
within various drive times from the
development (30 minutes, 45 minutes and 1
hour).
Chapter 15
3.87
The  SoS  notes  the  proposal  to  study  the
socio-economic  impacts for construction,
operation and decommissioning, with a
potential
workforce  of  between  150  and  250
persons  during  construction and  up  to  30
full  time  staff  during  operation.  Subject  to
procurement rules, much of this workforce will
be recruited locally.
The  SoS  recommends  that  the
assessment  includes  direct  and indirect
impact  with  full  explanation and  justification
for  any  presumptions used.
The creation of Full Time Equivalent (FTE)
jobs is considered in the Preliminary
Assessment of Potential Impacts section.
The assessment approach in the ES will
follow  HM Treasury guidelines and takes
account of displacement, leakage and
additionality factors
Socio-economic impacts (direct and indirect)
will be examined at construction, operation
and decommissioning phases in the ES
assessment.

The  SoS  recommends  that  the
assessment  criteria  should  be locationally
specific  and  consider  the  potential
significance  of  the
impacts of the proposal within the local and
regional context.
In addition to the response to 3.86 above,
socio-economic baseline information is
presented at a Rhondda Cynon Taff, South
East Wales or national level.
Community Infrastructure provision is
examined within a 5km radius of the proposed
