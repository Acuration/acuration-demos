The following information is provided in accordance with section 430(2B) of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
On 29 April 2015, Drax announced that Tony Quinlan had advised the Board of his intention 
to resign as Finance Director. Tony Quinlan ceased to be a director of the Company on 31 
May 2015 and his service agreement will terminate on 30 June 2015, the date on which he 
will leave the Company. 
Tony Quinlan will be receiving the following payments, which are in line with the provisions 
of his service agreement and the Company’s Remuneration Policy which is set out in the 
Company’s Annual Report: 
 
• 
Salary, pension payments and contractual benefits up to 30 June 2015; 
 
• 
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion in accordance with the Rules of 
the Bonus Matching Plan (“the BMP”) to allow outstanding Deferred Bonus Awards to 
vest in accordance with the leaver provisions of the BMP, pro-rated to the date on which 
he ceases to be an employee of the Company.  Tony will therefore receive 24,179 
shares (less the number of shares to be sold to meet income tax and National Insurance 
Contributions) as soon as practicable after 30 June 2015.   
 
No other remuneration payment, or payment for loss of office has been or will be made.
