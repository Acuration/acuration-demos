Bat Survey Report  
1.1 
Introduction  
1.1.1 
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to 
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).  
1.1.2 
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in 
Figure 1.1. The central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. 
1.1.3 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) Report (Appendix 8.1 of the ES) 
identified that surveys for bats were required at the Project Site.  The Project Site 
was assessed as having ‘High’ commuting and foraging potential (Collins, 2016).  
Four buildings (outside of, but adjacent to the Project Site boundary) were 
assessed as having the potential to support roosting bats (Appendix 8.1 of the ES).  
1.1.4 
This baseline report outlines the presence of bat species within the Project Site 
boundary and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial 
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.   
1.1.5 
The bat survey encompasses suitable habitat in close proximity to and within the 
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 1 and Figures 3.1-3.4.  
1.1.6 
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 which are 
presented in Appendix 8.1 of the ES.  
1.2 
Site Description 
1.2.1 
The Project Site supports semi-natural broadleaved and plantation woodland, rows 
of broadleaved trees, standalone broadleaved trees, dense and scattered scrub, 
improved and semi-improved grassland and marshy grassland, tall ruderal, running 
water ditches, ponds, species-rich hedgerow with trees, species-poor hedgerow 
with trees, species-poor intact hedgerows, earth banks, fences and bare ground 
(hard standing). In order to cover the Project Site adequately two walked transects 
were undertaken and nine static detector monitoring locations were established 
across the Project Site. 
1.2.2 
The walked transect North (Figure 3.1) predominantly encompasses improved 
grassland fields with hedgerows and mature tree lines. It also includes a few areas 
of dense scrub, semi-improved neutral grassland, and a running water ditch (which 
is connected to the Afon Llan watercourse outside of the Project Site) and a tree 
lined minor road and track. 
1.2.3 
The walked transect South (Figiure 3.1) predominantly encompasses; marshy and 
improved grassland fields with hedgerows and treelines, with ancient and semi-
natural woodland. It also includes semi-improved neutral grassland and areas of 
scattered scrub.  There are three running water ditches and the walked transect 
runs adjacent to a an area of running water on the eastern Project Site boundary 
which connects to the Afon Llan watercourse, which is outside of the Project Site.

1.2.4 
Plates 1.6 and 1.7 show exmaples of the transect habitats. 
1.2.5 
The nine static detector monitoring locations were placed on field boundaries 
across the Project Site, sampling improved grassland, semi-improved grassland, 
marshy grassland, field boundaries, woodland edges and trees lines. Table 1.25 
describes the habitats around each static detector location and locations of the 
static detectors are shown in Figure 3.4.

The Project  
1.3.1 
Full details of the Project and Site Description are provided in Chapter 3: Project & 
Site Description. 
1.4 
 Objectives of the Study  
1.4.1 
The objectives of this study were: 
 
To identify nature conservation sites within the Project Site or within 10km of 
the Project Site boundary designated for bats; 
 
To identify any known records and/or populations of bats within the Project Site 
or within 2km of the Project Site boundary; 
 
To establish the presence of any bat roosts within the Project Site; 
 
To establish bat species composition within the Project Site; 
 
To record and map spatial distribution and temporal bat activity within the 
Project Site;  
 
To highlight any potential ecological constraints in respect to bats; 
 
To outline further survey work that may be required; and, 
 
To make suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of the 
natural features identified within the Project Site in respect to bats.    
1.5 
Legislation 
1.5.1 
All bats and their roosts in Wales are fully protected under Schedule 5 of the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  They are also included in 
Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, known 
as The Habitats Regulations.  The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was amended 
by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW) which adds an extra 
offence of recklessly disturbing roosting bats or obstructing access to their roosts; 
makes species offences arrestable, increases the time limits for some prosecutions 
and increases penalties.  
1.5.2 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act, the Habitats Regulations and the CRoW Act, 
together make it an offence, among other things, to recklessly, intentionally or 
deliberately: 
 
Deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal which is a European 
Protected Species (EPS), 
 
Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species, and, 
 
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of such an animal

1.5.3 
Disturbance is defined as that which is likely: 
 
To impair their ability: 
o To survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
o In the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate 
or migrate; or 
 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to 
which they belong. 
1.5.4 
A bat roost is defined as “any structure or place (including trees) which any bat 
uses for shelter or protection”.  Because bats tend to re-use the same roosts, legal 
opinion is that the roost is protected whether or not the bat(s) are present at the 
time.  
1.5.5 
If the Project is likely to destroy or disturb bats or their roosts, then a European 
Protected Species License (EPSL) will be required from Natural Resources Wales 
(NRW), which would be subject to appropriate mitigation and working methods to 
protect bats.  
1.5.6 
This is a brief summary of the legislation.  When dealing with individual cases, the 
client is advised to consult the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further 
legal advice. 
1.6 
Quality Assurance 
1.6.1 
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s 
Integrated Management System (IMS).  Our IMS places great emphasis on 
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety 
management.  All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our 
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004 
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.  In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and 
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.   
1.6.2 
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the 
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2017) 
when undertaking ecological work.  
1.7 
Methodology 
a) Desk study 
1.7.1 
The desk study was completed as part of the AECOM PEA (Appendix 8.1 of the 
ES).  In relation to bats, the objectives of the desk study were to review the existing 
information available in the public domain to identify the following: 
 
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSIs) designated for bats within a 10km radius of the Project Site boundary 
paying due regard to Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) guidelines (Collins, 2016) , 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY

using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC) 
website (NE, 2017);  
 
Bat records up to 2km from the Project Site boundary, purchased from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC);  
 
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site 
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site 
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site using 
Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle website 
(WG and NRW, 2017); 
 
The Section 7 list of species of Principal Importance for Conservation of 
Biological Diversity in Wales; and, 
 
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, and features 
connecting these habitats (e.g. hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines) using 
aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps.   
1.7.2 
The County Ecologist and Glamorgan Bat Group was consulted regarding locally 
designated site citations, local bat records not available from SEWBReC and any 
local knowledge about the area. 
1.7.3 
Appendix 8.8 of the ES which contains the previous bat surveys undertaken by 
BSG Ecology in 2014 was provided by the client and reviewed. 
b) Bat Roosts in Buildings 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessments 
1.7.4 
There are no buildings within the Project Site. Buildings adjacent (adjacent is 
defined as up to 20m from the Site boundary) to the Project Site boundary were 
classified into categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat 
roost habitat.   
1.7.5 
The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for buildings.  
ii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.6 
Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
Each survey consisted of two surveyors stood around the buildings so that bats 
could be observed leaving/re-entering Potential Roost Features (PRF).  Bat activity 
was also recorded if observed by the surveyors.  
1.7.7 
Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours.  The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before sunrise and 
continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.   
1.7.8 
Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required.

High 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that are obviously suitable for use by 
larger numbers of bats on a more regular 
basis and potential for longer periods of time 
due to their size, shelter, protection, 
conditions (e. g.  temperature, humidity, 
height above ground level, light levels or 
levels of disturbance) and surrounding 
habitat.   
Can include structures with points of access 
to the interior of the building and poorly 
maintained fabric providing ready access 
points for bats into structures, but at the same 
time not draughty.  Structures of traditional 
stone, brick or timber construction.  
Structures with large (>20cm) roof timbers 
with mortice joints, cracks and holes.  
Structures of pre or early 20th century 
construction.  Structures with large 
complicated and/or uncluttered roof spaces 
providing unobstructed flying spaces.  
Structures with weather boarding and/or 
hanging tiles with gaps.  Structures with 
accessible south facing roofs.  Structures with 
proximity to good foraging habitat such as 
woodland, wetland, water and /or good 
hedgerows.  
A tree with one or more 
potential roost sites that 
are obviously suitable 
for use by larger 
numbers of bats on a 
more regular basis and 
potential for longer 
periods of time due to 
their size, shelter, 
protection, conditions (e. 
g.  temperature, 
humidity, height above 
ground level, light levels 
or levels of disturbance) 
and surrounding habitat.   
Moderate 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that could be used by bats due to their 
size, shelter, protection, conditions (e. g.  
temperature, humidity, height above ground 
level, light levels or levels of disturbance) and 
surrounding habitat but unlikely to support a 
roost of high conservation status.   
Can include structures with some potential to 
support roosting bats, but fewer features than 
a high risk building.  Features may include 
areas suitable for crevice dwelling and/or 
access points into structures.  Some proximity 
to foraging habitat.   
A tree with one or more 
potential roost sites that 
could be used by bats 
due to their size, shelter, 
protection, 
conditions 
and surrounding habitat 
but unlikely to support a 
roost

Negligible 
No features suitable for roosting bats.   
Can include structures constructed from 
unsuitable materials e. g.  prefabricated with 
steel and sheet material.  Structure is 
draughty, light and cool buildings with no 
roosting opportunities.  High levels of regular 
disturbance including external and/or internal 
lighting.  Building is isolated from areas of 
foraging habitat.   
Trees with no potential 
to support bats.

c) Bat Roosts in Trees 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Assessment 
1.7.9 
The bat study area comprised the land within the Project Site boundary and the 
area within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) (Figure 2). The Bat Survey Guidelines 
(Collins, 2016) state that bat roost assessments must be considered within the 
Project Site boundary and the areas under the ZoI of the project.  For potential bat 
roosts the ZoI was assessed to be all land within the Project Site boundary; and 
using professional judgement, within a 50 m buffer surrounding area where the 
Generating Equipment Site will be situated due to noise, vibration and lighting 
during construction, operation and decommissioning.  
1.7.10 Trees within or adjacent (adjacent is defined as up to 20m from the Site boundary) 
to the Project Site boundary were classified into categories dependent on the 
presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat.   
1.7.11 Trees up to 50m from the Generating Equipment Site were classified into 
categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat. 
1.7.12 The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for trees.  
1.7.13 Eleven trees with bat roost potential were identified during the PEA (Appendix 8.1 
of the ES).  Thirty four trees were identified during a ground level roost assessment 
of trees in July 2017.   
ii. Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.7.14 Following the Ground Level Roost Assessment trees which were assessed as 
having ‘Low or Moderate’ bat roost potential were subject to a PRF climbed 
inspection.  No trees with High bat roost potential were identified.  
1.7.15 These PRF climbed inspections were undertaken in August 2017.  The inspections 
were completed by certified and bat licenced tree climbers.  
1.7.16 The inspections paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 
2016), Bat Workers Manual (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004) and Bats and 
Woodland Management (Forestry Commission, 2005).  
1.7.17 Trees were climbed using ropes and/or ladders.  Once accessed, features were 
examined in detail using a torch, endoscope or mirror to inspect (where possible) 
the full extent of the features and search for bats or evidence of bat activity (e. g.  
droppings, urine stains, odour, feeding remains, scratch marks, grease stains, wear 
marks).  Where necessary, trees were re-categorised following the PRF climbed 
inspection.

1.7.18 Two trees identified as having bat roost potential during the preliminary ground 
level roost assessments were not climbed as they were approximately 20 and 55m 
outside of the Project Site boundary. 
1.7.19 Sixteen trees could not be accessed and two could not be found during the PRF 
climbed inspections, as described in the Limitations (Section 1.8).  
iii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.20 Following the Ground Level Roost Assessment and PRF climbed inspections, 
emergence/re-entry surveys were undertaken on trees with a category of Moderate 
or above.  
1.7.21 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016). 
Each survey consisted of one surveyor stood so that bats could be observed 
leaving/re-entering the PRF. Bat activity was also recorded if observed by the 
surveyors. 
1.7.22 Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours (see Limitations). The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before 
sunrise and continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.  
1.7.23 Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required. The weather conditions during 
the surveys were recorded and were largely considered favourable for bats.  
Survey dates and weather conditions are given in Table 1.3. 
d)  Bat Activity Surveys 
i. 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Commuting and Foraging Habitat 
1.7.24 The Project Site was assessed as having High commuting and foraging potential 
for bats (Collins, 2016) during the PEA (Appendix 8.1 of the ES).  Habitats within 
the Project Site were classified into categories dependent on the presence of 
features suitable for bats to commute and forage.  Table 1.2 provides category 
descriptions for commuting and foraging habitat.

Table 1.2 Commuting and Foraging Habitat Potential Categories 
Roost Suitability 
Descriptions 
High 
Continuous high-quality habitat that is well connected to the wider 
landscape that is likely to be used regularly by commuting bats 
such as river valleys, streams, hedgerows, lines of trees and 
woodland edge.   
High-quality habitat that is well connected to the wider landscape 
that is likely to be used regularly by foraging bats such as 
broadleaved woodland, tree-lined watercourses and grazed 
parkland. 
Site is close to and connected to known roosts.  
Moderate 
Continuous habitat connected to the wider landscape that could 
be used by bats for commuting such as lines of trees and scrub or 
linked back gardens.   
Habitat that is connected to the wider landscape that could be 
used by bats for foraging such as trees, scrub, grassland or 
water.   
Low 
Habitat that could be used by small numbers of commuting bats 
such as a gappy hedgerow or un-vegetated stream, but isolated, 
i. e.  not very well connected to the surrounding landscape by 
other habitat.   
Suitable, but isolated habitat that could be used by small number 
of foraging bats such as a lone tree (not in a parkland situation) or 
a patch of scrub.   
Negligible 
Negligible habitat features on site likely to be used by commuting 
or foraging bats.

ii. Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
1.7.25 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
Two walked transect routes were developed to sample the Project Site, one in the 
north and one in the south. These are shown on Figures 3.1 to 3.3.  
1.7.26 Each transect was walked twice per month. Dusk activity surveys were completed 
in June, July, August, September and October 2017. One dusk and dawn survey 
within one 24 hour period was completed in September 2017.  
1.7.27 No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project. Activity surveys following the methodology above are due to be 
undertaken in April and May 2018.  
1.7.28 Each survey consisted of two surveyors walking a pre-determined transect route at 
a steady pace across the Project Site. The start point and direction of each transect 
was varied across the months to reduce bias. 
1.7.29 The transect contained set Listening Points (LPs) which the surveyors stopped at 
for three minutes. Each transect contained 12 LPs, with the exception of the first 
set of surveys in June which had 11 LPs (see Section 1.8, Limitations). The 
locations of the LPs are shown on Figures 3.1 to 3.3.  
1.7.30 Tables 1.23 and 1.24 describe the habitat at each of the LPs. 
1.7.31 Dusk transect surveys began 15 minutes before sunset and continued for up to 3 
hours after sunset, except for one occasion (see Section 1.8, Limitations). The 
dawn transect started at least 2 hours before sunrise and continued until sunrise, 
except on one occasion (see Limitations).   
1.7.32 A broadband frequency division detector was used (Bat Box Duet with EM3) and 
digital recordings made to assist with species identification if required.   
1.7.33 The weather conditions for all but one of the surveys (see Section 1.8, Limitations) 
completed to date was considered to be favourable for bats. The weather 
conditions and survey dates are given in Table 1.3. 
iii. Bat Activity – Static Detector Surveys 
1.7.34 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice 
Guidelines (Collins, 2016). Nine static detector locations were selected within the 
Project Site to incorporate a range of habitats and give spatial coverage of the 
Project Site. The locations of the static detectors are shown in Figure 3.4. 
1.7.35 Static detector surveys were completed in June, July, August, September and 
October 2017.  
1.7.36 The dates of the static detector surveys were: 
 
June 26 – 01 July 2017; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
14 
 
 
 
24 July – 29 July 2017; 
 
23 August 2017 – 01 September 2017; 
 
12 September 2017 – 18 September 2017; and,  
 
17 October - 21 October 2017. 
1.7.37 No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project.  Activity surveys following the methodology above are due to be 
undertaken in April and May 2018.  
1.7.38 The static detectors were set to begin recording 30 minutes before sunset and 
continue until 30 minutes after sunrise for a period of five consecutive nights 
(Collins, 2016). Some equipment failures reduced the static detector recording time 
(see Limitations and Appendix 3A). 
1.7.39 Full spectrum frequency detectors (Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter 2 (SM2/SM2+) 
with sample rate 384kHz) and ultrasonic SMX-U1 omnidirectional microphones 
were used to obtain digital recordings of bat echolocation calls in order to 
determine the species present at each Static Detector Location. 
e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.7.40 Bat echolocation call analysis where required was undertaken by a suitably 
experienced ecologist, with support from reference material including the British Bat 
Calls Species Identification Guide (Russ, 2012).   
1.7.41 The AnalookW software programme (version 4.2n) was used to analyse bat 
echolocation calls.  A series of custom made filters in Analook were applied to the 
bat echolocation call data. All calls were manually checked once filters had been 
applied, and any additional or incorrect calls were relabelled. 
1.7.42 Long-eared bats have very quiet echolocation calls and these are often not 
recorded on bat detectors but may be audible using bat detectors. Where long-
eared bats are suspected but the echolocation call has not been recorded then the 
long-eared bat (possible) category has been used. This is shown in Tables 1.8 to 
1.12. 
1.7.43 There are six resident species of Myotid bat in Britain.  Myotid bats are difficult to 
identify to species level as the echolocation calls can have overlapping frequencies 
and can be visually similar when viewed on bat echolocation call software, such as 
Analook.  Therefore all Myotid bat echolocation calls were grouped together for the 
purposes of calculating Bat Activity Index (BAI). 
1.7.44 Where possible, calls with characteristics of specific Myotid bats were noted to 
inform the species composition within the Project Site.  
1.7.45 For the walked transect data, a BAI was calculated as the number of passes 
divided by the survey time in ‘hours’.  Survey time was calculated to the nearest 15 
minutes, expressed as 0.25 hours, to account for minor differences in survey 
duration (see Section 1.8, Limitations). 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
15 
 
 
1.7.46 For the static detector survey data, a BAI was calculated as the number of passes 
divided by the survey time in ‘nights’.  Survey time was calculated to the nearest 
0.5 nights, to account for differences in survey duration (see Section 1.8, 
Limitations and Appendix 3A).  The half way point for each night was calculated 
using the start and finish time. If the static detector failed before the half way point 
then 0.5 of a night was used in the BAI calculations.  If the static detector failed 
after the half way time point the whole night was used in the BAI calculations.   
1.7.47 Bat activity is an indication of the amount of use bats make of an area (Collins, 
2016). A bat pass is defined by BCT as a sequence of greater than two 
echolocation calls made as a single bat flies past the microphone (BCT, 2017).  A 
bat pass is an index of bat activity rather than a measure of number of individuals in 
a population (Collins, 2016).  
1.7.48 The statistics software programme ‘R’ (R Core Team, 2013) was used to assist data 
interpretation and to help look for statistically significant differences and/or 
relationships. This was completed by an ecologist with appropriate statistical 
knowledge and experience of the programme. 
1.7.49 Due to the variation in successful recording nights, statistical tests could only be 
completed from the first night of data from each static detector, for each month.   
1.7.50 The data was assessed for normal distribution and the most appropriate statistical 
tests applied. The data was not normally distributed and therefore non parametric 
tests, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon, were used. 
1.7.51 Calculated values within this report have been given to one decimal place, except 
for survey times in Table 1.13, BAI totals in Table 1.18 and BAI values in Table 1.20.

1.8 
Limitations 
1.8.1 
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may 
not be comprehensive and accurate.  However, if assessed in conjunction with a 
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.   
a) 
Suitable Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.8.2 
There are 16 trees which were not climbed due to access and/or health and safety 
restrictions and there are two trees which were not climbed as they could not be 
found due to dense woodland, however were the subject of emergence survey at a 
later date.  These trees did not have their bat roost suitability category altered from 
the original assigned category and all trees with Moderate suitability subsequently 
had emergence/re-entry surveys. Therefore this is not deemed to be a significant 
limitation. 
b) 
Roost Survey  
1.8.3 
Building 1 did not have a full Ground Level Preliminary Assessment due to time 
constraints (Appendix 8.1 of the ES). However this building is approximately 120m 
outside of the Project Site boundary and no further surveys were considered 
necessary on this building. Therefore this is not a significant limitation.  
1.8.4 
Access was not granted to Buildings 7 and 8 (collectively known as Abergelli Farm) 
to the west of, but outside of the Project Site boundary and these could not be 
assessed for their suitability to support roosting bats.  However, these buildings 
(BSG Buildings 4 and 5) were previously assessed by BSG (PB, 2015) (see Table 
1.4).  The previous results will be used in the assessment. These buildings will be 
subject to emergence and re-entry surveys in 2018.  
c) Bat Activity Walked Transect Survey 
1.8.5 
The first set of June walked transect surveys had 11 LPs per transect, this was 
increased to 12 LPs per transect for all subsequent surveys.  This was done to 
increase the spread of sample points.  This is not deemed to be a significant 
limitation to the surveys or this report.  
1.8.6 
On 10 July 2017 during the Northern Transect the SD recording card briefly came 
out of the EM3 bat detector and calls during that period were not recorded 
electronically.  However, this was replaced and all bats heard during the period 
were recorded on the survey sheet and were of common species which the 
surveyor was able to determine species identification with confidence.  This is not 
deemed to be a significant limitation to the survey or the results.   
1.8.7 
On 13 September 2017 the dawn South Transect survey finished at 06:42 which 
was 5 minutes before sunrise, however no bats had been heard since 06:16 and 
therefore this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.

1.8.8 
On a small number of occasions surveyors walked past an LPs or LPs were not 
accessible meaning that bat data was not recorded for 3 minutes at that location. 
For calculations of Bat Activity Index, the survey time at each LP has been adjusted 
to reflect this variation and will mitigate the impact of this limitation of the 
comparisons of bat activity between LPs. The occasions are listed below:  
 
On 10 July 2017 North Transect LP 4 was missed;   
 
On 23 August and 7, 11 and 12 September 2017, North Transect LP1 was not 
accessible due to horses being present in the field. A replacement LP was 
completed as close as possible to the original location at LP1a, as shown on 
Figure 5.2; 
 
On 7 and 13 September 2017 LP7 on the South Transect not accessible due to 
the presence of rams in the field.  On 7 September 2017, LP9 was missed, this 
was replaced with LP9a (see Table 1. 12, LP9a and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was 
replaced with another LP close to the original location, this is not deemed to be 
a significant limitation;  
 
On 3 October 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with LP9b (See Table 
1.12, LP9b and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was replaced with another LP close to the 
original location, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.  
1.8.9 
No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project.  Best practice guidelines recommend transect surveys are 
undertaken between April and October (Collins, 2016).  Activity walked transect 
surveys following the methodology described above are due to be undertaken in 
April and May 2018.   
1.8.10 The weather conditions encountered on the dusk transect surveys on 13 
September 2017 (see Table 1.3) were not considered wholly favourable for bats, 
but not so bad as to need to abandon the survey.  There was light rain at 21:33 and 
a spell of heavy rain between 21:50 and 22:17.  The North Transect was also 
sampled at dusk on 11 September 2017 in September in favourable weather 
conditions. 
1.8.11 It was not possible to incorporate land within the National Grid land within a walked 
bat activity transect due to due to site access restrictions at night and during the 
early morning.   
d) Bat Activity Static Detector Survey 
1.8.12 Some of the static detectors did not record for the full five night period. Details of 
malfunctions and reduced survey nights are provided in Appendix 3A Static 
Detector Limitations.  
1.8.13 No data was recorded at South 3 in June 2017 and South 1 in July 2017.  
1.8.14 Data in these locations was successfully collected in the other 4 months. 
1.8.15 No data was recorded at:  Lane 2 in August and September 2017.  Two other static 
detectors (Lane 1 and Lane 3) were positioned within the Lane and have captured 
bat activity which is representative of the Lane.

e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.8.16 Different bat species vary in their likelihood of detection using bat detectors and 
therefore it is not relevant to compare numbers of bat passes from different species 
(Collins, 2016).   
1.8.17 Results of the statistical analysis could only utilise the first night of data for each 
location in each month, due to the variation in successful recording nights. 
Therefore, the results are less powerful than if the full five nights could have been 
compared. However, the statistical analysis provides an additional tool, alongside 
BAI and count data in the interpretation of bat activity.

Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology. See 
Appendix 8.8 of the ES. 
 
The Site boundary included within these reports is different to the 
2017 Project Site boundary. The 2017 Project Site is smaller than 
the red line boundary used by BSG in 2014, however lies entirely 
within the area covered by the 2014 BSG surveys. A summary of 
the previous bat species surveys is detailed below:

Description 
Eleven buildings with bat roost potential were identified.  Internal 
inspections of buildings confirmed non- maternity roosts in three 
buildings. These are shown in Appendix 2A: 
 BSG Building 4: A scattering of long-eared bat, pipistrelle and 
lesser horseshoe bat droppings were found in the store rooms; 
 BSG Building 8: Small piles of long-eared bat and pipistrelle 
droppings found in both first and second storey at the north of 
the building; and,  
 BSG Building 10: Two pipistrelle droppings were found on the 
floor.  
 
BSG Building 1, 2, 5 and 11 were categorised as having 
Moderate bat roost potential.  BSG Building 7 was categorised as 
having Low bat roost potential.  BSG Building 3 and 9 were 
categorised as having Negligible bat roost potential (Hundt, 
2012). 
The buildings identified by BSG in 2014 fall outside of the 2017 
Project Site.  However, some of these buildings adjacent to the 
Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  Details 
are provided in Table 1.5.   
 
Tree – Ground Level Roost Assessments 
Thirty three trees were considered to have potential to support 
roosting bats.  29 of these were subject to a climbed inspection. 
Emergence and/or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight 
trees.  BSG Trees T3, T4 and T9 are located within the 2017 
Project Site.  No bats were recorded emerging or re-entering any 
potential roost features. No tree roosts were identified. Trees 
within the Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  
Details are provided in Section 1.11.  
Bat Activity Walked Transect Surveys 
At least seven species of bat were recorded during transect 
surveys; common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Myotis sp., long-
eared bat, noctule, Leisler’s bat, and lesser horseshoe bat.  All of 
these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated 
static 
detector 
surveys; 
Nathusius’ 
pipistrelle 
Pipistrellus nathusii, serotine Eptesicus serotinus and greater

1.9.2 
Six buildings were assessed for their potential to support roosting bats in 2017 and 
11 buildings were assessed by BSG in 2014.  The results of the assessment are 
provided in Table 1.5.  
1.9.3 
Building locations are provided in Figure 2. A map showing the AECOM 2017 
results is provided in Figure 4.1 and a map showing the 2014 BSG building 
locations is provided in Figure 4.2. 
1.9.4 
Access was not granted to Buildings 7 and 8 (known as Abergelli Farm) in 2017 
(outside the Project Site) and therefore these could not be assessed for their 
potential to support roosting bats in 2017.  Details are given in Section 1.8 
Limitations.   
1.9.5 
In November 2017, a trial shaft and adit, adjacent to the Project Site was identified. 
Underground sites can be of value to hibernating bats, including horseshoe, long-
eared and Myotis species. The approximate locations mine shaft and adit are 
shown in Figure 6.  These were assessed for their suitability to support roosting 
bats in March 2018. The adit is sealed, with no potential for underground 
hibernation and this has been capped and filled in. The adit is close to Building 4.  
The trial shaft entrance was located and a depression in the ground which was 
grassed over was visible. Historical maps had identified that the trail shaft had been 
dug to 57ft and 6 inches and backfilled. There were no access points for bats. The 
trail shaft is not suitable for hibernation.

ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
Trees - Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment 
1.9.8 
The results of the Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
Trees - Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspections 
1.9.9 
All trees with Low or Moderate bat roost suitability were put forward for climbed 
inspection.  A full table of results from the climbed inspections are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
1.9.10 All trees inspected were reduced to Negligible or Low bat roost suitability. No bat 
roosts were identified.   
1.9.11 Trees 3, 19, 21, 36 and 44 could not be accessed and therefore retained their 
original Moderate rating. These trees were taken forward for emergence and re-
entry surveys, in the absence of the climbed inspection assessment.  
1.9.12 Trees with Low bat roost suitability do not require further survey but may need to be 
checked for roosting bats before removal.   
Emergence/Re-entry Surveys 
1.9.13 The results of the emergence /re-entry surveys are provide in Table 1.7. The 
locations of the trees and the roost results are shown on Figure 4.   
1.9.14 Of the five trees surveyed, one bat roost was confirmed in Tree 19.  Whilst the bat 
was seen entering the tree, no calls were detected. This is possibly due to the 
distance of the tree canopy from the surveyor, and the angle of the bat from the 
detector. It has been concluded that the species is likely to be a common pipistrelle, 
because a brief common pipistrelle pass was heard approximately nine seconds 
before the roosting bat was seen flying around and then disappearing into the 
crown of Tree 19.  
1.9.15 A Photograph of Tree 19 is provided in Plate 1.1.

Preliminary Project Site Assessment 
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Bat Roosts in Buildings  
1.10.1 There are no buildings, and hence no building bat roosts, within the Project Site.  
1.10.2 Buildings adjacent to the Project Site were assessed. None of the buildings 
surveyed by AECOM supported bat roosts. Previous surveys by BSG in 2014 
confirmed roosts in buildings not surveyed by AECOM in 2017 (Appendix 8.8 of the 
ES). This is expressed in Table 1.6 and shown on Figure 4.2:  
ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
1.10.3 Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  
No other trees were identified as bat roosts. A photograph of Tree 19 is shown in 
Plate 1.1.  
b) Bat Activity – Species Composition 
1.10.4 At least 13 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close 
proximity of and within the Project Site.  The following species have been identified 
during bat surveys at the Project Site: 
 
Greater horseshoe 
 
Lesser horseshoe; 
 
Common pipistrelle; 
 
Soprano pipistrelle; 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 
Daubenton’s; 
 
Natterer’s; 
 
Mytois species; (including calls with characteristics of Bechstein's, Brandt's 
Myotis brandti and Whiskered Myotis mystacinus); 
 
Noctule; 
 
Serotine; 
 
Leisler’s; 
 
Long-eared species; and, 
 
Indeterminate species.

i. 
Pipistrelle species  
1.10.5 Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site.  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 86.8 % of all passes recorded 
on the walked transect surveys and 93.9% of the static detector surveys.  They 
were also the most commonly recorded species during the emergence/re-entry 
surveys.  Pipistrelle species comprised of 89.5% of the passes recorded on the 
North Transect and 84.6% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.   
1.10.6 Pipistrelle species were similarly the most commonly recorded species during the 
BSG 2014 transect and static detector surveys (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
1.10.7 Two passes of Nathusius' pipistrelle were recorded during the July transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one record from the North 
Transect, making up 0.2% of total bat passes. 
1.10.8 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded at Lane 1 in June and one pass of 
Nathusius' pipistrelle at North 2 in October, making up <0.1% of the total bat 
passes.  
1.10.9 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded during the BSG static detector 
surveys in 2014 at Location D8 (ES Appendix 8.8)).  Location D8 is in a similar area 
to the AECOM South 1.  Nathusius' pipistrelle were not identified during the BSG 
2014 activity transect surveys (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
ii. Myotis species 
1.10.10 Myotis species comprised 9.8% of the total calls recorded on the transect surveys. 
Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North Transect and 
11.5% of the calls recorded on the South Transect  
1.10.11 Activity levels for Myotis species during the 2017 transects surveys were 
comparable with the activity levels recorded during the BSG 2014 transect surveys 
(Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
1.10.12 A total of 1881 Myotid bat passes, 5.6% of the total calls, were recorded during the 
static detector surveys. Myotis species were recorded in every month, with the 
highest level of activity recorded in July with BAI of 20.6, and the second highest 
level recorded in June with a BAI of 17.0. 
1.10.13 Some of the Myotid bat echolocation calls from the static detector surveys were 
considered to have characteristics of Bechstein's (85 passes), Brandt's (50 passes) 
and whiskered (87 passes). BSG did not identify Myotis to species level (Appendix 
8.8 of the ES).  
iii. Noctule, Serotine, and Lieslers Species 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
53 
 
 
1.10.14 Noctule and serotine bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded on walked 
transect surveys. Noctule and serotine bats comprised of 1.9% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 1.8% of the passes recorded on the South 
Transect.  BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages (Appendix 8.8 of 
the ES).  
1.10.15 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's (N/S/L) bats comprised 0.4% of the passes recorded 
during the static detector surveys.  
1.10.16 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's were recorded during the BSG 2014 static detector 
surveys Serotine were not identified during the BSG 2014 activity transect surveys 
(ES Appendix 8.8).  
iv. Long-eared Species 
1.10.17 Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.5% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.6% recorded on the South Transect   
surveys.  BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages (Appendix 8.8 of 
the ES). 
1.10.18 Long-eared bats comprised 0.1% of the passes recorded during the static detector 
surveys.  
v. Horseshoe Bat Species  
1.10.19 There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the total 
passes for the Project Site.  This was recorded in August 2017.  BSG 2014 also 
recorded only one lesser horseshoe bat pass, again recorded on the BSG south 
transect (Appendix 8.8 of the ES). 
1.10.20 A total of 14 lesser horseshoe passes were recorded during the static detector 
survey:  
 
Three passes recorded in July; one pass at South 3 and two passes at Lane 3; 
 
Eight passes recorded in August; six passes at South 2, one pass at South 3 
and one pass at Lane 1:  
 
Two passes in September:  one at Lane 1 and one at Lane 3; and  
 
One pass in October at Lane 3.   
1.10.21 BSG recorded a single lesser horseshoe pass at Location D3 (Appendix 8.8 of the 
ES), which is in a similar area to AECOM South 3.   
1.10.22 Greater horseshoe was not detected during the walked transect survey. A single 
greater horseshoe pass was recorded at Lane 2 in July during the static detector 
surveys. BSG recorded two greater horseshoe passes in 2014, in Locations D5 and 
D8 (Appendix 8.8 of the ES). Location D5 was located along the Gallops near to 
Abergelli Farm and is not comparable with any of the AECOM locations as this is 
outside of the Project Site Boundary.  Location D8 is relatively close to AECOM 
South 1.

c) Bat Activity – Spatial Distribution 
1.10.23 Figure 5.1 shows the spatial distribution of individual bat passes recorded during 
the transect surveys. Figure 3.4 shows the static detector locations. 
1.10.24 In total 940 bat passes were recorded during the walked transects.   
1.10.25 Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Transect (513 bat passes; 
15.2 BAI), compared to the Northern Transect (427 bat passes, 13. 2 BAI). The bat 
activity levels are broadly similar.  
1.10.26 In total 33,764 bat passes were recorded during the static detector surveys.  Table 
1.22 gives the bat activity by the Static Detector Location Groups. Higher levels of 
activity were recorded in the Southern Static Detector Locations (7,779 total bat 
passes; 148.2 BAI), compared to the Northern Static Detector Locations (5,847 
total bat passes, 87.3 BAI), reflecting the pattern of the walked transect. 
1.10.27  Using the first night data from static detector surveys, the species richness 
recorded across different locations was not statistically significant (Appendix 4A: 
Table 2.5). Therefore, similarly to the walked transect results, the bat activity levels 
between North and South are broadly similar.  
1.10.28 The highest level of activity was recorded in the Lane Static Detector Locations 
(20,138 total bat passes, 372.9 BAI). The Lane Static Detector Locations (even with 
the equipment malfunctions, see Limitations) had higher levels of activity compared 
to both the North and South Static Detector Locations combined. This may be 
because the Lane is likely used for foraging, along the sheltered woodland edge, 
and detectors may have been recording multiple passes by the same bats up and 
down the Lane.  
1.10.29 During the walked transects bat activity was recorded across the Project Site 
(Figure 5.1). Vegetated stream or wet ditch corridors appear to be important for 
bats within the Project Site. The distribution of bat call suggests the following 
general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment only: 
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis Species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas 
near water; 
 
Noctule and Serotine bats were primarily recorded at height over open fields 
across the Project Site; 
 
Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are 
focused more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The 
passes recorded are within approximately 315m to 700m of the BSG confirmed 
long-eared roost in Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG 
confirmed long-eared roost in Building 2;  
 
The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a 
mature tree line approximately 900m south of the closest known lesser 
horseshoe roost in Building 2.

1.10.30 The distribution of bat echolocation calls detected during the static detector surveys 
suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment 
only:  
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis species were recorded across the Project Site; 
 
Noctule, Serotine and Leisler bats were recorded across the Project Site ;  
 
Long-eared bats were recorded at the majority of Static Detector Location 
except for North 1 and Lane 2;  
 
The single greater horseshoe was recorded at Lane 2 in the south-west of the 
Project Site; and 
 
Lesser horseshoe bats were recorded within the south and south-west of the 
Project Site at South 2, South 3, Lane 1 and Lane 2.

d) Bat Activity – Temporal Distribution 
1.10.46 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017.  Bat 
surveys for April and May are due to be undertaken in 2018.  
1.10.47 August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 8.5 
and the South Transect had a BAI of 4.8. 
1.10.48 For the North Transect, the second highest BAI was 7.0, both in June and July. 
1.10.49 For the South Transect, the second highest BAI was 3.0 in July and the third 
highest was 2.8 in October.   
1.10.50 For the static detector surveys, July had the highest BAI of 377.3, the second 
highest BAI was 238.9 in June.  
1.10.51 Higher levels of Myotis species activity in June and July during the 2017 static 
detector surveys were comparable with the higher activity levels recorded in June 
and July during the BSG 2014 static detector surveys (PB, 2015), although it 
should be noted that BSG did not have any static detectors placed within the lane 
area to the west of the Project Site.   
1.10.52 As seen in Plate 1.4 the months of August and October have a greater level of 
species richness than September. This was a statistically significant result as seen 
in Appendix 4A: Tables 2.5 and 2.6.  
1.10.53 The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data show that bat passes 
is influenced by month (Plate 1.2  and Appendix 4A: Table 2.2). June has a 
significantly higher bat echolocation call frequency than August and October 
(Appendix 4A: Table 2.3). This result differs from the walked transect results which 
showed highest level of bat activity in July and June as the second highest. Both 
survey methods indicate that the summer months had the highest level of activity. 
This is likely due to general bat ecology, with bats being most active in mid-
summer.   
1.10.54 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.

1.11 
Preliminary Potential Effects 
1.11.1 A full assessment of effects at construction and operation has been undertaken for 
the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) and reported in the ES.  
1.11.2 Figure 7 indicates the location of potential constraints / impacts.  At this stage the 
following potential effects have been identified:  
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Destruction and Loss of a Roost 
1.11.3 Tree 19 was the only confirmed roost within the Project Site.  The Project will not 
require the removal of Tree 19.  
ii. Killing and Injury 
1.11.4 Based on the current known distribution of bat roosts within the Project Site, there 
is no risk of killing or injuring bats during construction and operation.  
iii. Disturbance 
1.11.5 Without mitigation, there is potential for disturbance to bats due to noise and 
vibration and external lighting during construction and operation.  
b) Bat Commuting and Foraging 
i. 
Habitat Loss 
1.11.6 The Project Site is used by bats, particularly the vegetated watercourse/wet ditch 
corridors, followed by woodland edges and hedgerows with mature trees.   
1.11.7 A proportion of the broadleaved semi-natural woodland, semi-improved grassland 
and marshy grassland will be removed as part of the Project. Without mitigation, 
hedgerows and mature trees lines will be removed for construction of the Electrical 
Connection and new section of Access Road. This will reduce the amount of habitat 
available to foraging bats.  
ii. External Lighting 
1.11.8 An Outline Lighting Strategy provided in Appendix 3.5 of the ES. There will be an 
increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction and operation. 
There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project Site. If 
external lighting for the Project is poorly designed there is potential for a light spill 
onto hedgerows, tree lines, woodland edges and vegetated areas. Many species of 
bat are adverse to light, with different species having different tolerances. External 
lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat unsuitable or inaccessible and 
therefore cause in-direct habitat loss.

iii. Noise 
1.11.9 There will be an increase in ambient noise at the Project Site during construction 
and operation. Construction noise will be temporary and is considered unlikely to 
impact on foraging bats in the long-term. Operational noise is discussed further 
below.  
1.11.10 The Generating Equipment will only be operational intermittently at times of peak 
demand and will not emit ultrasonic noise (ultrasonic being noise which is higher 
than the upper audible limit of human hearing, typically considered to be above 
20kHz).   
1.11.11 The Generating Equipment is predicted to emit a sound power level of around 
100dB LWA, the power peaks at a frequency of around 50/63 Hz and roughly halves 
with every doubling of frequency above that. A typical attenuated power station 
sound power spectrum is shown in Plate 1.8. This only goes up to 8,000Hz (8kHz) 
but the tail off in the spectrum continues with increased frequency, showing that 
there will be little sound power (dB LA) above 10,000Hz (10kHz).  
1.11.12 The specific sound level near the Project Site boundary is estimated to be 
approximately 55dB LAeq (ES Chapter 7 Noise – Figure 7.1) (this term is the 
Equivalent Continuous Level, a type of average, where noisy events have a 
significant influence). The theoretical average sound pressure level (dB LA) at the 
Project Site boundary approximately 30m from the Generating Equipment will be 
approximately 55 dB LA to 63 dB LA. Equivalent general sounds comparisons are: 
50 dB LA is light traffic or rainfall; 60 – 65 dB LA is normal conversation; and 85 dB 
LA is heavy traffic.

1.11.13 There is limited research on the impact of anthropogenic noise on foraging bats 
and no directly comparable research on the impacts of power station noise have 
been identified. Research that exists shows that increased anthropogenic noise can 
negatively impact foraging activity of some species of bats, particularly low 
frequency bats (<35kHz), as a result of prey masking and avoidance of noise. Two 
of these are summarised below. 
1.11.14 Bunkley et. al. (2015) investigated the potential effects of gas compressor station 
noise in the USA on the activity levels of the local bat assemblage. The gas 
compressor stations run 24 hour a day, 365 days a year. The mean background 
sound level (dB LA) recorded at 50m from the gas compressor site centre was 
between 70 and 85dB LA. The frequency of the compressor noise was 24kHz.  
1.11.15 Bunkley et. al. (2015) found that activity levels for the Brazilian free-tailed bat 
(Tadarida brasiliensis) were 40% lower at loud compressor sites compared to 
quieter well pads, whereas the activity levels of four other species (Myotis 
californicus, M. cillolabrum, M. lucifugus, Parastrellus hesperus) were not affected 
by noise. The assemblage of bat species emitting low frequency (<35kHz) 
echolocation calls showed a 70% reduction in activity levels at loud sites compared 
to quieter well pad sites whereas the assemblage using high frequency (>35kHz) 
echolocation did not exhibit altered activity levels. Bunkley et. al. (2015) concluded 
that lower activity levels of Brazilian free-tailed bats at loud sites indicate a potential 
reduction in habitat for this species and that this species modifies its echolocation 
search calls in noise, producing longer calls with a narrower bandwidth, which 
might affect prey detection.  
1.11.16 Luo et al., 2015 investigated how anthropogenic noise impairs foraging, which has 
direct consequences for animal survival and reproductive success, using 
Daubenton’s bats, which ﬁnd prey by echolocation. The study looked to identify the 
potential mechanisms of disturbance in any species capable of detecting the noise, 
namely acoustic masking of prey echoes, reduced attention and noise avoidance. 
The study used playback of traffic noise and was laboratory based. Traffic noise 
was played at around 76dB LA, at nonoverlapping frequencies below 25kHz (not 
spectrally overlapping the minimum call frequency of Daubenton’s, which is at 
28kHz), and overlapping frequencies above 25kHz. 
1.11.17 Luo et al., 2015 found that trafﬁc noise reduced foraging efﬁciency in most 
Daubenton’s bats. This effect was present even if the playback noise did not 
overlap in frequency with the prey echoes. Neither overlapping noise nor 
nonoverlapping noise inﬂuenced the search effort required for a successful prey 
capture. Hence, noise did not mask prey echoes or reduce the attention of bats. 
Instead, traffic noise acted as an aversive stimulus that caused avoidance 
response, thereby reducing foraging efﬁciency.  
1.11.18 The frequency emitted from the Generating Equipment (between 50Hz and 
10,000Hz (10kHz)) is unlikely to mask the frequencies of large bat prey items, 
which are generally in the range of 20 - 35kHz and frequencies less than 1 kHz are 
probably inaudible to bats (Luo et al., 2015).  
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
68 
 
 
1.11.19 Bunkley et. al. (2015) suggests that bat species emitting low frequency (<35kHz) 
echolocation calls may be more affected by noise than other species. At the Project 
Site, bats which echolocate at frequencies <35kHz include the large bats; noctule, 
serotine and Leisler's. Lower frequency bats at the Project Site make up 5.8% of 
the total composition of bat species, the rest are higher frequency bat species 
(>35kHz). However, the predicted frequencies emitted from the Generating 
Equipment (between 50Hz and 10,000Hz (10kHz)) were much lower than in 
Bunkley et. al. (2015) and, as above, are unlikely to mask prey items for any bat 
species. 
1.11.20 There may be some noise avoidance by some bat species when the Generating 
Equipment is operating, as there is little research available to be able to completely 
rule out potential avoidance from noise of 55 – 63dB LA . However, the generation 
of noise would be sporadic and the sound power anticipated at the Project Site 
boundary is lower than that in the studies summarised above and it would be 
anticipated that any impact from avoidance would therefore be comparably lower. 
No studies were identified which looked at potential foraging impacts from sound 
power (dB LA) less than 70dB LA to be able to draw any direct conclusion. 
1.11.21 At the Project Site, the sporadic nature of the noise generated with times of peak 
demans most likely to occur during winter (when bats are hibernating) during the 
early evening (16:00 – 18:00, when people get home from work and before bats 
emerge from roosts), combined with the sound power peaking at a frequency well 
below the typical frequency used by echolocating bats, it is considered that noise 
will not have a significant impact on the population of foraging bats within the 
Project Site.

iv. Severance and Fragmentation 
1.11.22 The removal of trees and woodland is required to facilitate the construction of the 
new section of Access Road. Without mitigation, this will sever the connectivity to 
habitats either side of the track, resulting in severance and fragmentation of 
retained areas.  
1.11.23 The removal of tree lines and hedgerows may be required in order to facilitate the 
construction of the Gas Connection in the north of the Project Site. Removal or 
severance of tree lines and hedgerow will sever the connectivity they provide and 
create fragmentation of retained habitat. 
1.11.24 During construction of the Project natural habitats including hedgerows and tree 
lines will be removed and converted to new areas of hardstanding and buildings.  
This will fragment and sever the connectivity of the habitats located to the north and 
to the south of the Project. This will impact on bats using the existing features in the 
landscape to commute and forage between these two areas.  
1.11.25 An Outline Lighting Strategy provided in Appendix 3.5 of the ES. There will be an 
increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction and operation. 
There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project Site. Many 
species of bat are adverse to light, with different species having different 
tolerances.  External lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat 
unsuitable and fragment commuting routes.  If external lighting for the Project is 
poorly designed there is potential for a light spill onto hedgerows, tree lines, 
woodland edges and vegetated areas which will negatively impact on bats, 
severing commuting routes and impeding access to foraging habitat.  Poorly 
designed lighting also has the potential to affect areas outside the Project Site 
boundary.

1.12 
Preliminary Recommendations for Further Surveys and Mitigation 
a) Recommendations for Further Surveys 
1.12.1 A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and 
reported in the ES.  At this stage it is anticipated that further surveys will be 
required. The following recommendations have been made:  
 
Walked bat activity transect surveys in April and May 2018 using the same 
methodology for the walked bat activity surveys undertaken in 2017; 
 
Static detector bat surveys in April and May 2018 and assessment to augment 
the walked transect data; 
 
Building assessments and further bat surveys on Buildings  7 and 8 within the 
Abergelli Farm (schedule to be undertaken in 2018);  
 
Pre-construction checks on trees, scheduled for removal, should be assessed 
for their current bat roost suitability with consideration of the seasonal survey 
timings. 
1.12.2 Although further surveys are recommended it is considered that, utilising data from 
2014 and 2017 surveys undertaken to date, an accurate assessment of bat activity 
within the Project Site has been made. Further surveys are recommended to 
confirm that the most appropriate and effective mitigation measures have been 
determined; mitigation has been included in a Landscape and Ecological Mitigation 
Plan (LEMP). 
b) Recommendations for Mitigation 
1.12.3 A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction 
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this 
stage the following key recommendations have been made:  
 
Based on the current Project proposals a European Protected Species Licence 
(EPSL) is not a requirement. However, should the scope of the Project  change 
and/or if further bat roosts are identified a EPSL may be required; 
 
Compensate for loss of foraging habitat; 
 
Maintain connectivity of foraging and commuting habitats by the retention of 
trees and hedgerows wherever possible. Figure 7 shows areas of potential 
conflict; 
 
Utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash, to maintain connectivity during 
construction;  
 
Create new green corridors to mitigate loss, provide alternative routes and 
enhance the local landscape;  
 
For construction of the Electrical Connection consider directional drilling under 
hedgerows and mature tree lines to avoid felling and avoid severance; 
 
If less important hedgerows need to be severed temporarily during construction 
of the Electrical Connection the severed areas should be replanted with whips 
and standards; 
 
It is recommended that reasonable avoidance measures should be taken if any 
trees with a Low bat roost potential need removing as part of the Project 
(Hundt, 2012).  This is likely to include soft-felling of trees under ecological 
supervision from a bat licenced ecologist;

 
Plant a mix of locally native species of standard trees and whips along both 
sides of the new section of Access Road to create a ‘hedgerow with trees’; and, 
 
Avoid external lighting wherever possible. Only light areas which need to be lit 
to meet minimum standard. Where external lighting is needed it should be 
designed to avoid and reduce light spill following best practice guidelines for 
lighting and bats (Gunnell 2012, BCT 2009), and should be reviewed by an 
ecologist. Where external road lighting is needed the use of bollards with 
louveres should be considered to keep lighting directional and below head 
height, timer or motion sensors should be used. 
c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement  
1.12.4 A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made 
during the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this stage the following precautionary 
recommendations have been made:  
 
Woodcrete bat boxes on trees; 
 
Improve existing hedgerows by infilling with locally native species standard 
trees to maintain connectivity to key foraging areas; and, 
 
Creation of new hedgerows and green corridors of locally native species.

Abergelli Power Project – Bat Survey Report

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014) identified records of a number of 
bat species within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary, as defined at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the 
‘Survey Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake surveys for bats within the 150 ha of 
pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm between April and October 2014 within the Survey 
Site, as part of a range of ecological surveys to inform and support an application for Development 
Consent for the Project. 
1.3 
A range of surveys were carried out in accordance with published best-practice guidance focusing 
on investigating the distribution and variety of bat species present within the Survey Site. These 
included; walked transects, automated bat detector surveys, and internal and external inspections 
of trees and buildings. 
1.4 
At least seven species of bats were recorded during transect surveys; common pipistrelle 
Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Myotis sp., long-eared bat 
Plecotus sp., noctule Nyctalus noctula, Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri, and lesser horseshoe bat 
Rhinolophus hipposideros. All of these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated bat detector surveys; Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, serotine Eptesicus 
serotinus, and greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. By far the most frequently 
recorded species were common and soprano pipistrelle with 90 % of calls identified as one or other 
of these two species. Myotis sp. bats were also recorded frequently with noctule recorded 
infrequently but regularly. The six other species of bats were recorded occasionally or singly. 
1.5 
Roost surveys of buildings within the Survey Site confirmed that at least three buildings contained 
bat droppings and were used as bat roosts. Droppings from at least three species of bats 
(pipistrelle sp., long-eared bat sp. and lesser horseshoe bat) were found. Thirty three trees were 
located within the Survey Site that are thought to have potential to support roosting bats. 
Emergence and / or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight trees all of which would potentially 
be directly affected by the Project.  No bats were recorded emerging from or entering these 
potential tree roosts.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake surveys for bats between April 
and October 2014 as part of a suite of ecological surveys to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site and comprise a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including bat surveys. These 
baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental 
Statement, which is intended for submission in support of the application for Development Consent.

The aims of the bat surveys within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Identify the bat species using the Survey Site and the activity levels of bats within the Survey 
Site; 
 
Identify whether there are any features that are capable of supporting roosting bats; and 
 
If the above features are likely to be affected by the Project, establish whether they are used by 
roosting bats.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected1 species, including bats, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up 
to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary.  
Site Appraisal  
3.2 
The areas of marshy grassland, trees, scrub, woodland and streams within the Survey Site 
potentially provide good foraging habitat for bats, with similar habitat present in the surrounding 
landscape providing habitat continuity and connectivity throughout the landscape. The desk study 
returned records of five species of bats, which are all fairly common and widespread. In addition, 
the Survey Site has habitat that is capable of supporting roosting and foraging habitat for rarer 
species of bat that have been recorded in the Swansea area, for example lesser horseshoe bat, 
greater horseshoe bat and barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus.  
3.3 
Overall, the Survey Site has been assessed as being of ‘Medium Habitat Quality’ following 
consideration of the current best practice bat survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Therefore the 
following methods were used at the appropriate level of survey effort, as recommended by the 
guidelines: 
 
Walked transects; and  
 
Automated detector surveys.   
3.4 
In addition, a number of buildings and trees within the Survey Site were surveyed for presence / 
likely absence of roosting bats. The following methods were used: 
 
Internal and external building inspection or tree roost climbing inspection; and 
 
Dusk emergence and pre-dawn re-entry surveys of potential roosts that are likely to be 
affected by the Project.  
Bat Activity Surveys 
Walked Transects 
3.5 
Walked surveys of two pre-determined transect routes (northern and southern, see Figure 1) were 
undertaken monthly between April and October 2014.  The pre-determined transect routes were 
largely contained within the Survey Site, with the southern route extending a short distance to the 
east of the Survey Site in one area.  
3.6 
Each transect started around sunset and took approximately 2-3 hours to complete. The timing of 
the surveys therefore covered the bat emergence period and the period of most intense foraging 
activity when invertebrate prey is most abundant (Altringham, 2003).   
3.7 
The same transect route was walked on each survey visit with the start points and direction 
changed on each visit to ensure that different parts of the Survey Site were surveyed at different 
times of the night. This approach was adopted to remove any bias that could be introduced into the 
survey data if each survey was walked in the same direction. This bias could otherwise have 
resulted in any given point on the transect route being visited at approximately the same interval 
after sunset.  Static recording points were selected for each transect.  At these points the surveyors 
were stationary for three minutes to listen and record all bat passes. 
3.8 
Bat activity was recorded using Anabat hand-held electronic bat detectors. This model of detector 
automatically records all the bat passes they detect, which significantly reduces the chances that

bats could be missed due to human error. Wherever possible, surveyors recorded the observed 
behaviour and numbers of bats onto a field proforma. This was to aid identification and also to 
provide additional detail on the behaviour of observed bats. Field notes included a record of the 
time of each bat encounter, allowing results to be cross-referenced with the recorded data. 
3.9 
The main aim of the transect walks was to identify areas of high bat activity, such as foraging areas 
and/or commuting routes (e.g. wet ditches, marshy grassland and hedgerows). Accordingly, the 
transect routes focussed on such areas. 
3.10 
When possible, all walked transects avoided heavy rain, strong winds and dusk temperatures 
below 10°C as recommended in the BCT guidelines (Hundt, 2012).  
Automated detector surveys 
3.11 
In addition to the transect surveys, automated surveys were conducted using Wildlife Acoustics 
Song Meter 2 (SM2BAT+) bat detectors which are full spectrum detectors that are triggered 
automatically to record bat echolocation calls.  These detectors can be deployed and left to 
remotely record bat activity for a period of several nights. 
3.12 
The BCT guidance recommends that two locations per transect route are surveyed each month. In 
this case, eight survey locations were used across the Survey Site with four in each half of the 
Survey Site (north and south). Each location was surveyed every other month to enable a larger 
number of survey locations to be sampled over the survey season but ensure that each location 
was sampled in spring, summer and autumn. Bat detectors would be deployed at four locations 
(two in the north and two in the south) in April, June, August and October with the other half of the 
locations sampled in May, July and September.  
3.13 
The detectors were deployed for five nights at each of the locations, which allowed continuous 
monitoring to take place during the period when bats are active, i.e. sunset to sunrise. They were 
programmed to begin recording from half an hour before sunset until half an hour after sunrise.  
Survey hours varied throughout the survey season according to daylight hours and have been 
calculated for each recording session in order to accurately calculate activity indices.  
Materials and Data Analysis 
Full details of the equipment used for surveys and the data analysis methods are provided in 
Appendix 2. 
Bat Roost Surveys 
Internal and External Building Inspection 
3.14 
The internal/external survey of eleven buildings within the Survey Site was undertaken on 25th June 
2014 by Principal Ecologist and experienced bat worker Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM (Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW) Licence number 52240:OTH:CSAB:2014) with assistance from Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. Eleven buildings (Buildings B1 – B11) (see Figure 2, 
Appendix 1) were inspected to assess their potential to support roosting bats and to search for 
evidence of bat activity.  
3.15 
The survey included all the buildings within the Survey Site, except for those contained within the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site, which were visually inspected using binoculars from 
boundary fences during the PEA survey in July. The buildings within these sites do not apparently 
have any features that could support roosting bats and it was not necessary to arrange access to 
these sites to carry out a more detailed inspection of any of the buildings.  
3.16 
During the survey a thorough search was made of the buildings including all accessible areas and 
crevices for bats, their droppings, food remains or characteristic grease marks at potential roost 
exit/entrance points.  The exterior of the buildings were searched, paying particular attention to 
window ledges, where droppings can gather undisturbed, and under potential roost access points, 
such as loose tiles and gaps between boarding. Where possible, internal inspections were also 
undertaken.

3.17 
Signs of bat activity searched for included: 
 
Live bats; 
 
Droppings; 
 
Urine staining; 
 
Feeding remains (e.g. discarded wings of flying invertebrates); 
 
Oil staining; 
 
Smell; 
 
Daytime vocalisations; 
 
Absence of cobwebs (a well-used bat roost and its access points are typically clear of 
cobwebs); 
 
Scratching; and 
 
Dead bats.  
3.18 
All buildings were assigned a category defining their potential to support roosting bats in 
accordance with Table 1 below. 
Table 1: Categories defining the potential for buildings to support roosting bats. 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
Negligible  
Building with no or very limited roosting opportunities for bats, no 
evidence of use by bats and where the feature is isolated from foraging 
habitat. 
Low  
Building with a limited number of roosting opportunities, no evidence of 
current use by bats and with poor connectivity to foraging habitat. 
Medium  
Building with some roosting opportunities, with no evidence of current 
use by bats and with connectivity to moderate – high quality foraging 
habitat. 
High  
Building with multiple roosting opportunities for one or more species of 
bat, and with good connectivity to high quality foraging habitat. 
Confirmed Roost 
Presence of bats or evidence of recent use by bats. 
Internal and External Tree Inspection 
Preliminary Ground Level Inspection of Trees 
3.19 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal conducted (on 24 February, 14 April and 9 July 2014) 
included a preliminary ground-level assessment of trees for their potential to support roosting bats. 
Features of trees that may be used by roosting bats include: 
 
Natural holes; 
 
Woodpecker holes; 
 
Cracks or splits in major limbs; 
 
Loose bark; and 
 
Hollows or cavities. 
3.20 
Any trees with apparent roosting features were recorded and assigned a category defining their 
potential to support roosting bats in accordance with Table 2 below, as adapted from Hundt, 2012 
(Table 8.4, p. 60). The locations of these trees are shown in Figure 3a, Appendix 1.

Table 2: Categories defining the potential for trees to support roosting bats. 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
1* 
Trees with multiple, highly suitable features capable of supporting larger 
roosts. 
1 
Trees with definite bat potential, supporting fewer suitable features than 
category 1* trees or with potential for use by single bats. 
2 
Trees with no obvious potential, although the tree is of a size and age 
that elevated surveys may result in cracks or crevices being found; or 
the tree supports some features which may have limited potential to 
support bats. 
3 
Trees with no potential to support roosting bats.  
Roped Access Survey of Trees 
3.21 
Any trees that were identified during the Phase 1 survey as category 2 or above, i.e. have potential 
to support roosting bats were further assessed by Anton Kattan2 and Ted Bodsworth, during a 
roped access (or tree climbing) survey. The aim of this survey was to closely inspect features 
identified during the Phase 1 survey and re-categorise trees as necessary. The trees were 
surveyed from 15-17 July 2014. Weather conditions during the three day period were generally 
good with light rain on 16 July 2014.  
Dusk emergence and Dawn Re-entry Surveys 
3.22 
Following on from the internal and external inspections described above, dusk emergence and 
dawn re-entry surveys were undertaken between 12 and 28 August 2014. The survey was 
undertaken in a smaller area than the Survey Site described above; due to refinements in the 
Project design and extent of the Project Site which assisted in determining which potential roosts 
would be affected by the Project and, therefore, would require further survey. A plan of the reduced 
area was provided on 8 August 2014 and the trees within this reduced area, along with their roost 
potential categorisation are shown in Figure 3b, Appendix 1. No buildings are anticipated to be 
directly affected by the Project, and therefore all the buildings were excluded from further surveys. 
The recommendations included in the BCT guidance (Hundt, 2012) for the level of survey effort 
required to determine the presence or absence of bats from a structure are shown in Table 3.  
Table 3: Survey effort required for determining presence / absence of bats at a potential roost 
Level of bat potential 
Survey effort required 
High roost potential 
3 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September including 2 
between mid-May and August. 
Low to moderate roost potential 
2 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September including 2 
between mid-May and August. 
Low roost potential 
1 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September. 
3.23 
The roped access surveys are considered equal effort to one emergence or re-entry survey, 
therefore reducing the number of further activity surveys by one. The tree categories were split into 
the three roost potential categories as follows: 1* - high roost potential; 1 – low to moderate 
potential; 2 – low roost potential; and 3 – no roost potential. Table 4 shows the additional activity 
surveys required on each of the trees. Where it was not possible to carry out a roped access 
survey on the trees within the reduced area, namely T5, T32 and T35, an additional emergence or 
re-entry survey was carried out.

The dusk emergence surveys commenced approximately 15 - 30 minutes before sunset and 
continued until approximately 1½ - 2 hours after sunset. The dawn re-entry survey commenced 
approximately 1½ - 2 hours before sunrise and finished 15 minutes after sunrise. 
3.25 
Surveyors used two different bat detectors on each survey to supplement visual observations: a 
Batbox Duet detector for listening to bat calls from the combined heterodyne/frequency division 
output and an Anabat frequency division detector for recording calls for subsequent identification. 
Limitations of Study Methods 
3.26 
No significant limitations to the study methods were noted. The access route in the south-west of 
the Survey Site (Access Road Option 2) and the western part of the land surrounding the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations were not included 
in the transect surveys as access to these areas could not be arranged until late in June and was 
not permitted at night for security reasons. This area is a small proportion of the Survey Site that 
does not contain habitats significantly different to those present in other parts of the Survey Site, 
and is unlikely to support a more diverse species assemblage than the rest of the Survey Site. As 
such, it is not considered that this is a significant limitation to the survey methods. 
3.27 
No access was granted to the roof voids of the three residential buildings (buildings 1, 2, and 5 – 
see Table 12) surveyed for roosting bats. This limitation to the survey is unlikely to be significant 
given that these buildings will not be directly affected by the Project.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site’ in the records which was located 
approximately 1 km to the south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.2 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule, and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. 
There were also records of unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and other records where the bat species 
was not specified. 
4.3 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.

There were 43 Pipistrelle sp. passes recorded during the walked transect that could not be 
identified to species level, as the peak frequency of the calls were within a frequency range used 
by more than one species (see ‘Materials and Data Analysis’ in Appendix 2 for details of how 
pipistrelle bats were identified). These have not been included in the results tables.  
4.7 
A total of 464 bat passes (B) were recorded during the north transect, including at least five 
species, a total of 494 bat passes were recorded during the south transect, including at least seven 
species. The relative activity level (Bat passes per hour (B/h) for the definition of B and B/h used in

Relative Activity of Bats 
4.8 
Across the survey season, common pipistrelle was the most frequently encountered species during 
walked transects with 15.4 B/h and 60.2 % of all passes recorded as this species (B = 577).  
Soprano pipistrelle was the second most numerous with 6.4 B/h. When passes from unidentified 
pipistrelles are added to the total, 89.8 % of all the recorded passes were identified as bats from 
the Pipistrellus genus4. Activity levels of 1.8 B/h and 0.7 B/h were recorded for Myotis sp. and 
noctule respectively with one pass recorded for Leisler’s bat, lesser horseshoe bat and long-eared 
bat sp.  
4.9 
Bat activity levels varied between transects, with a mean of 26.1 B/h (range; 7.3–70.4 B/h). 
Fluctuations between surveys are within normal limits, being influenced by factors such as short-
term variations in weather conditions and prey availability and seasonal variations.  During April, an 
average across both surveys of 49.8 B/h was recorded, which then declined in May to 22.3 B/h and 
in June (14.4 B/h) and then rose again in July (36.5 B/h). In the autumn bat activity declined again 
with an average of 24.2 B/h recorded in September, which dropped again in October (12.2 B/h). 
The highest level of activity recorded during a single transect survey occurred during the April 
transect in SA2 when an activity rate of 70.4 B/h (B = 176) was recorded. 
Spatial Distribution of Bats 
4.10 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded during every survey and occurred in most of 
the Survey Site. The highest number of passes was recorded along linear features such as hedges 
or streams, with lower activity over open fields. Passes were recorded throughout transect surveys, 
with the majority being recorded later in the night; however, 12 passes were recorded within 20 
minutes of sunset. 
4.11 
A total of 67 passes of Myotis bats were recorded, with a relatively wide scatter of records 
throughout the Survey Site. The highest proportion of passes was recorded along the stream to the 
east and woodlands in the south of the Survey Site. No passes were recorded within 20 minutes of 
sunset. 
4.12 
Noctule was recorded infrequently and in low numbers with just 26 passes recorded. Most passes 
were recorded during the southern transect, with single passes scattered throughout the Survey 
Site.  Twelve of the passes recorded were within the first 20 minutes after sunset. 
4.13 
One pass of lesser horseshoe bat was recorded on 3 June near the woodland at the north corner 
of the National Grid gas compressor station. This was recorded 67 minutes after sunset. 
Automated Detector Surveys 
4.14 
Automated bat detectors were operating for a total of 132 nights, equating to 1,266 hours and 50 
minutes of survey time between April and October 2014. Table 8 gives details of automated bat 
detector deployment dates and locations with the latter illustrated in Figure 1, Appendix 1. Table 9

Relative Activity of Bats 
4.15 
A total of 27,634 passes from at least ten species of bat were recorded. Figure 6 illustrates the 
proportion of activity recorded for different species at each automated survey location, for the 
whole survey period as well as spring (April-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-
October) in Figures 7 to 9. Data for bats not identified to species-level (e.g. common/soprano 
pipistrelle), or for which there were so few calls recorded that the activity rate cannot be 
meaningfully illustrated (e.g. greater and lesser horseshoe bat), have not been illustrated in the 
Figures provided in Appendix 1. The relative activity of bat species recorded at all detector 
locations is recorded in Table 10.

Across the survey season, the highest relative activity rate recorded was for common pipistrelle, at 
an average of 14.2 B/h (B = 17975) followed by soprano pipistrelle (4.8 B/h) with 90.0% of all the 
recorded passes identified as bats from the Pipistrellus genus. The next most frequently recorded 
species were Myotis sp. with 1.8 B/h (B = 2328) and noctule (0.2 B/h). There were also 45 long-
eared bat Plecotus sp. passes recorded, with six passes for lesser horseshoe bat, two for greater 
horseshoe bat, three for serotine Eptesicus serotinus and just one Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
nathusii pass.  
4.17 
The data presented in Table 11 indicates that overall bat activity dropped from spring (April and 
May; 43.0 B/h) to summer (June - August; 19.1 B/h) and again in autumn (September and October 
11.4 B/h). The pattern of activity was the same for all species of bats except long-eared bat sp. 
which increased from <0.1 to 0.1 B/h from spring to summer, and serotine and Nathusius’ 
pipistrelle which were only recorded in the spring and autumn respectively.

Distribution of Bats 
4.20 
The highest activity levels came from three detectors that each recorded 29.9-35.7 B/h as follows: 
 
D5 (29.9 B/h) - located at the corner of a patch of woodland to the west of the Survey Site. 
The large majority of passes were from common pipistrelle bats (20.7 B/h). Two of the six 
lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded at this location, as was one of two greater 
horseshoe bat passes. The highest Myotis activity (5.0 B/h) was recorded at this location. 
 
D4 (30.5 B/h) - located at the south corner of the Survey Site in trees along a stream corridor. 
High activity levels of common (13.4 B/h) and soprano (13.0 B/h) pipistrelle bats were 
recorded, as well as two of the six lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded at this location. 
 
D8 (35.7 B/h) – located on the corner of woodland surrounding the National Grid Gas 
compressor station to the west of the Survey Site. High levels of activity were recorded from 
common (22.7 B/h) and soprano (9.5 B/h) pipistrelle bats. One of two greater horseshoe bat 
passes was recorded. 
Myotis bats 
4.21 
In total, 2,328 Myotis sp. passes were recorded at an average rate of 1.8 B/h. Myotis bats were 
recorded at all of the static locations and during every deployment. Higher activity rates were 
recorded in the spring (4.0 B/h) than the summer (0.9 B/h) with a slight increase again in autumn 
(1.4 B/h). 
4.22 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the south of the Survey Site than the north (2.8 B/h and 
1.0 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity was recorded at D5 (5.0 B/h), in the most 
southerly part of the Survey Site. 
4.23 
The nocturnal activity of Myotis bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 40 minutes after sunset, with a peak around one hour after sunset and 
consistent activity throughout the night until around 40 minutes before sunrise. 
 
 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Bat Survey Report 
 
15 
10/03/2015 
Noctule bats 
4.24 
In total, 228 Noctule passes were recorded at an average rate of 0.2 B/h. Noctule bats were 
recorded at all of the static locations. Higher activity rates were recorded in the spring (0.5 B/h) 
which then dropped away during the summer (0.1 B/h) with a further drop in autumn (<0.1 B/h). 
4.25 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the south of the Survey Site compared to the north (0.2 
B/h and 0.2 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity was recorded at D3 and D6 (0.3 B/h), 
along the eastern side of the Survey Site. 
4.26 
The nocturnal activity of Noctule bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 20 minutes after sunset, with three calls in total recorded before sunset, and a 
peak in activity around 40 minutes after sunset followed by consistently low activity throughout the 
night until around 20 minutes before sunrise. 
Leisler’s and Serotine bats 
4.27 
In total four Leisler’s bat and three serotine bat passes were recorded on the Survey Site, with an 
additional 24 passes that were identified as either Leisler’s bat or serotine.  
4.28 
Leisler’s bat passes were recorded at detector numbers D5 and D6, in the west and north-east of 
the Survey Site respectively. Serotine passes were recorded at detectors D3 and D8, in the 
woodland in the east of the Survey Site and the woodland around the Gas Compressor Station in 
the west respectively. All passes of Leisler’s bat / serotine occurred at detector D8.  
4.29 
All of the bat passes were recorded within the first 60 minutes after sunset with the exception of 
one Leisler’s bat pass and one Leisler’s bat / serotine pass which were both recorded in the middle 
of the night.  
Pipistrelle bats 
4.30 
This section covers common, soprano and Nathusius’ pipistrelles and also any pipistrelle calls that 
could have been from either species (see Appendix 2). In total, 17,975 common pipistrelle passes 
were recorded (14.2 B/h), with 6,019 soprano pipistrelle (4.8 B/h), and a total of 772 unidentified 
pipistrelle passes (0.6 B/h); 97% of all pipistrelle calls were therefore recorded to species level. 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded from all detectors during every deployment. 
Much higher activity rates were recorded for common pipistrelle in the spring (29.6 B/h) than the 
summer (12.2 B/h) and autumn (11.4 B/h). This was also true for soprano pipistrelle, with 7.4 B/h in 
spring, 5.3 B/h in summer and 2.7 B/h in autumn. Only one Nathusius’ pipistrelle pass was 
recorded, during the autumn at D8 (in the south east of the Survey Site). 
4.31 
Higher levels of common and soprano pipistrelle activity were recorded in the south of the Survey 
Site than the north (25.5 B/h and 12.9 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity for common 
pipistrelle was recorded at D8 (22.7 B/h). For soprano pipistrelle highest relative activity was at D4 
(13.0 B/h), the only location at which soprano pipistrelle levels nearly matched common pipistrelle, 
along the eastern side of the Survey Site. 
4.32 
The nocturnal activity of pipistrelle bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 20 minutes after sunset, with a peak from 40 to 80 minutes after sunset. There 
was constant activity recorded throughout the night until around 20 minutes before sunrise, with a 
secondary peak around 60 to 40 minutes before sunrise. 
Long-eared bat sp. 
4.33 
In total, 45 long-eared bat sp. passes were recorded at an average rate of 0.04 B/h. Long-eared 
bat sp. were recorded at low levels at all of static locations, with a peak activity level of 0.1 B/h at 
D1. A higher number of passes were recorded in the summer (31 passes) than the autumn (13 
passes) and the spring when only one pass was recorded. 
4.34 
Long-eared bat sp. was recorded at all detectors with peak activity levels at D1 and D3, both on the 
western side of the Survey Site next to woodland.

Horseshoe bats 
4.35 
Six lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded across four detector locations, D3, D4, D5 and D7, 
located in the centre of the Survey Site. Four of these passes were recorded in spring, with one in 
the summer and one in autumn. A single pass was recorded from D3 on 18 June, with two passes 
recorded from D4 on 25 April, single passes recorded on 18 and 19 May from D5 and a further 
single pass recorded at D7 on 20 September. Bat passes were recorded between 1-1.5 hours after 
sunset or 55 minutes – 1.5 hrs before sunrise in spring and summer, and in the middle of the night 
(23:45) in autumn.  
4.36 
Two greater horseshoe bat passes were recorded at detector locations D5 and D8 during the 
middle of the night in July and September respectively.

Internal and External Tree Inspection 
Preliminary Ground Level Inspection of Trees 
4.39 
A total of 33 trees were identified during the preliminary ground level inspection of trees as having 
potential bat roosting features. The details of each tree are recorded in Table 13 below with their 
locations shown in Figure 3a, Appendix 1.  
4.40 
All but four of the trees that were identified were further assessed during the roped access survey 
(see below). 
Roped Access Survey of Trees 
4.41 
A total of 29 trees were climbed using ladders or rope access. Four trees were inaccessible or 
unsafe to climb. Table 13 includes descriptions of the potential roosting features and the BCT 
category (see Table 1) assigned to each tree following the roped access survey.

Appendix 2: Materials and Data Analysis 
Use of Bat Detectors 
The bat detectors used for automated surveys were Wildlife Acoustics SM2Bat and SM2Bat+. These are 16-
bit full-spectrum bat detectors with internal storage and computing power that allows the unit to be used as a 
remote fixed-point detector. Recording is triggered by ultrasound, such as bat calls, in the vicinity of the 
detector, and any bat calls are stored as sound files on an internal SD card.  
SM2 detectors were placed in water-proof boxes connected by a 10 m cable to an omnidirectional Wildlife 
Acoustics SMX-US microphone. The microphones were attached to a telescopic pole at 3.5 m above ground 
level on, and angled at 45° to the ground to allow water to run off, as recommended by the manufacturers.  
For walked transect surveys and emergence/re-entry surveys, surveyors used two different bat detectors on 
each survey to supplement visual observations: a Batbox Duet detector for listening to bat calls from the 
combined heterodyne/frequency division output and an Anabat (SD1 or SD2) detector or Wildlife Acoustics 
Echo Meter 3 (EM3) for recording calls for subsequent identification. 
Assessment of data from bat detectors 
The likelihood of detecting bats acoustically depends on the propagation of sound through air, the 
characteristics of bat calls, and the way sound is received and processed by the bat detector. Recent 
unpublished collaborative research by BSG Ecology and Bristol University has shown that bat detectors 
detect calls from some species of bats at greater distances than others. In general, bats with calls that can 
be detected over greater distances are larger bats which use calls that are both high amplitude and low 
frequency such as the noctule and the most difficult to detect are those which use low amplitude calls, such 
as the brown long-eared bat and barbastelle, or high frequencies, such as horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 
spp.). Table 1 shows the mean frontal detection range of SM2 detectors for echolocation calls from UK bat 
species based on research undertaken by BSG Ecology in collaboration with Bristol University.

standard ‘field’ settings and converting to zero-crossing recordings.

Data Analysis 
Bat Call Identification 
Recorded bat calls were analysed using Analook software to confirm the identity of the bats present. Where 
possible, the bat was identified to species level. For species of long-eared bats records were not identified to 
species level due to the overlapping call parameters of each species but were assumed to refer to brown 
long-eared bats. It is unlikely that grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus) occurs in Swansea, given the 
species’ known distribution and rarity (Harris & Yalden, 2008). Species of the genus Myotis6 were grouped 
together as many of the species have overlapping call parameters, making species identification problematic 
(BCT, 2012). 
For Pipistrelle species the following criteria, based on measurements of peak frequency, were used to 
classify calls: 
Common pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥42 and <49 kHz 
Soprano pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥51 kHz 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
 
 
 
<39 kHz  
                                                      
5 Refers to any bat species of the genus Myotis. 
6 This genus includes several regularly occurring species in the UK that include, Natterer’s bat, Daubenton’s 
bat Myotis daubentonii, Brandt’s bat Myotis brandtii, whiskered bat and Bechstein’s bat Myotis bechsteinii. 
 
 
 
Common pipistrelle / Soprano pipistrelle  
≥49 and <51 kHz 
Common pipistrelle / Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
≥39 and <42 kHz 
Bat calls which could not be ascribed to any of these categories were not used in the analysis. 
Calculation of relative activity 
The SM2 detectors were configured to record above the level of ambient noise, such as from wind or rain, 
and set to define a bat pass (B) as a call note of >2ms which is separated from another by more than one 
second. 
AnalookW (Version 3.8, 2010) software was used for all analysis of bat calls. It enables analysis of the 
relative activity of different species of bats by counting the number of bat passes (B) recorded within a unit of 
time – hour (h) was used. More than one pass of the same species was counted within a sound file if multiple 
bats were recorded calling simultaneously. During analysis of sound files, it was possible to estimate the 
minimum number of bats recorded on individual sound files but not whether consecutive sound files had 
recorded, for example, a number of individual bats passing as they commute to a feeding habitat or one bat 
calling repeatedly as it flies up and down the edge of forestry.  Although relative abundance cannot be 
estimated from this analysis, the number of bat passes does reflect the relative importance of a 
feature/habitat to bats by assigning a level of bat activity that is associated with that feature, regardless of the 
type of activity. 
Analysis by sunset-sunrise times 
As part of the analysis of nocturnal patterns of behaviour for bats the data were split into discrete time 
periods relating to their proximity to sunset or sunrise. The time categories (time codes: TC) were as follows:  
TC 0 = before sunset 
TC 1 = 0-20 min after sunset 
TC 2 = 20-40 min after sunset 
TC 3 = 40-60 min after sunset 
TC 4 = 60-80 min after sunset 
TC 5 = 80-100 min after sunset 
TC 6 = 100-120 min after sunset 
TC 7 = Middle of night (varies across seasons) 
TC 8 = 120-100 min before sunrise 
TC 9 = 100-80 min before sunrise 
TC 10 = 80-60 min before sunrise 
TC 11 = 60-40 min before sunrise 
TC 12 = 40-20 min before sunrise  
TC 13 = 20-0 min before sunrise 
For each of these categories B/h was calculated to allow a comparison between the activity level recorded in 
different time periods and TC7 was corrected to allow for variation in night length throughout the survey 
season. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3: Building Descriptions 
Internal/External inspection 
The building layouts and referencing as described in the following section is illustrated in Appendix 1: 
Figures. In order to assist with the building descriptions, each building has been given a letter/number 
combination identifier.  
B1 
This is a two storey domestic property approximately 40-50 years old. It sits east to west on the Survey Site, 
with footprint dimensions 20 m x 8 m. The roof is constructed from hanging slate tiles and has a pronounced 
pitch, with boxed-in eaves on the gable ends. There are sections of lead flashing around the chimneys and 
eaves. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following external features: 
• 
Under gaps in the eaves where boxed in sections have sagged or are broken; 
• 
Under lead flashing; 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles; and 
• 
In space under ridge tiles. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, there is no evidence that it is currently being utilised as a roost. 
N.B.     A shed in close proximity to B1 is constructed of wood cladding and has an open soffit into its roof 
space under felt. Owing to its high exposure and well-lit features, it was also deemed to have low potential 
for bat roosting potential. 
B2 
This property is a two storey domestic abode, approximately 40-50 years old but sitting 90° N of B1. This is 
an identical build to B1 but varies in specific features for roosting potential. There are opportunities for bat 
roosting in the following external features: 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles on south facing roof and water heater to the east side of 
the property; 
• 
Under lead flashing around entrance, on the roof and gable ends; 
• 
Under lifted ridge tiles where lifted; and 
• 
In gaps between boxed eaves and flashing. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, there is no evidence that is currently being utilised as a roost. 
B3 
This building is a corrugated metal framed agricultural building, its footprint dimensions are approximately 30 
mx20 m and it is situated on the south side of the Survey Site at the top of a track leading to a gallops track. 
The building is single storey with lower block curtain walling and with low profile metal sheet on the upper 
side of the walls and roof. It is currently being utilised as a stable for horses.  
Although there is lead flashing below the corrugated metal roof, upon internal inspection, an exposed interior 
with a lack of suitable roosting features means this building is considered to have negligible bat roosting 
potential. The building was however, considered to have some feeding potential. 
B4 
This is a stable block of stone, a solid wall construction, one storey tall. The roof is pitched with felt lined 
hanging tiles concluding in boxed eaves. There is considerable over hang in the boxed eaves. On internal 
inspection of the building there is a false ceiling made of plywood. 
• 
Room with partition and false ceiling, very dark; 
• 
Gaps above door frames; 
 
 
 
• 
Cracks in existing stable walls; 
• 
Space between breeze block gable ends (roof); and 
• 
Several open windows (1m in width, opening 1ft wide) and garage doors often ajar. 
B4 is a confirmed roost. There were stains and droppings (pipistrelle sp., long-eared bat sp. and lesser 
horseshoe) found upon internal investigation in one room of the stable block, and the majority of the building 
lends itself to roosting and feeding potential. 
B5 
This is a two storey terraced house approximately 50-60 years old. The roof is constructed from hanging 
slate tiles and has a pronounced pitch, with boxed-in eaves on the gable ends. There are sections of lead 
flashing around the chimneys and eaves. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following external 
features: 
• 
Under gaps in the eaves where boxed in sections have sagged or are broken; 
• 
Under lifted lead flashing; 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles; and 
• 
In space under ridge tiles. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, no signs of roosts were found. 
B6 
This building is a corrugated metal framed agricultural building with lower block curtain walling and with low 
profile metal (and some plastic) sheet on the upper side of the walls and roof. The building is currently being 
utilised as storage for farm equipment such as disused vehicles & tools and hay bales. The footprint 
dimensions are roughly 30 m x 20 m and it is one storey tall. The area behind the hay bales at the far end of 
the building which is being used as stables for several horses could not be accessed for further investigation.  
No evidence of bats roosting was found during the internal/external search and no potential roost features 
were identified. Therefore this building is considered to have negligible potential for roosting bats. 
B7 
This is a single storey brick outbuilding with a corrugated metal roof. The building has several small vents 
and cavity walls. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Accessible cavity walls through external vents. 
No evidence of bat roosting was found during the internal/external search and therefore this building is 
considered to have low potential for roosting bats. 
B8 
This building is comprised of three sections. The first two are part of the original structure which is over 100 
years old (est. 1900) and is constructed from brick walls with a corrugated, pitched metal roof with a series of 
fly ins and open access points on the roof apex. There is also a second storey tower on the north end of the 
building. The far north section is a single storey porta cabin style building approximately 4 m x 2 m with open 
windows and doors. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Gaps under the corrugated metal roof; 
• 
In the stone vents/access points at the apex of the structure; 
• 
In the series of lead flashing found around the top of the tower portion of the main brick building; 
• 
Multiple fly-in opportunities in both storeys; and 
• 
In the tower block, historic roost evidence, several small piles of disintegrated droppings, identified 
as long-eared bat Plecotus auritus droppings and at least one Pipistrelle sp. in both first and second storeys. 
B8 is a confirmed roost. There were droppings from at least two bat species found upon internal investigation 
of both storeys and the majority of the building lends itself to roosting and feeding potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
B9 
This building is a single storey breeze block shed of recent build with a footprint of 3 m x 3 m. The building 
has solid walls and a flat corrugated metal roof. No evidence or potential or actual roost points were noted 
upon internal or external investigation.  
Owing to the lack of signs and potential roosting features this building is considered to have negligible bat 
roosting potential. 
B10 
This property is a single storey, one-room brick outbuilding with footprint dimensions of 4 m x 3 m. The 
building has no doors or windows and the roof is concrete and flat with the internal ceiling exhibiting cracks 
and fissures. The brick walls are cavity walls with many missing bricks and openings. Although there is no 
door, there is an east facing entrance. Upon internal investigation two Pipistrelle sp. droppings were found 
on the floor. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Cavity walls with missing bricks; 
• 
East facing entrance, fly-in; 
• 
Cracked ceiling; and 
• 
Also, bat droppings found in building. 
This building is a confirmed roost owing to the discovery of bat droppings and a variety of optimal features for 
roosting potential.  
B11 
This is a derelict stone cottage over 100 years old. Its footprint dimensions are 15 m x 10 m. There are two 
distinct standing walls and there is no roof remaining. The walls are rubble filled and many stones are 
missing. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Missing stones leading to rubble filled internal wall. 
Because the structure sits in a cluster of trees and has some notable roosting features, this building is 
considered to have moderate roosting potential.

Introduction
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full
description of the development is provided in Chapter 3 (Project and Site
Description) of the Environmental Statement (ES).
1.1.3    The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (ES Appendix 8.1) identified that    sur
veys
for
hazel 
dormouse
Muscardinus 
avellanarius
hereafter 
called 
‘dormouse’ or ‘dormice’, were required at the Project Site.
1.1.4
This baseline report describes the status of dormouse within the dormouse survey
area
and
makes
initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The dormouse survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible areas of
woodland, hedgerows and scrub within proximity of and within the Project Site
boundary, as shown on Figure 1 and Figure 2.
1.1.6
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology which are presented in
the ES Appendix 8.15.
a)
Objectives of the Study
1.1.7
The objectives of this study were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support dormouse;
·
To identify any known records and/or populations of dormouse in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of dormouse activity;
·
To make a population estimate of dormouse within the Project Site;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the Project Site in respect to
dormouse;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints in respect to dormouse;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified within the Project Site in respect to dormouse.

1.2
Legislation
1.2.1
The dormouse is a fully protected species under both United Kingdom and
European law. It is also included in the Environment Act (Wales) 2016 Section 7
List as a species of principal importance. This is a brief summary of the legislation
and is not to be regarded as a definitive legal opinion. When dealing with individual
cases, the client is advised to consult the full texts of the relevant legislation and
obtain further legal advice.
1.2.2
The dormouse was given partial protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act
(WCA) 1981. Schedule 5 of this Act was amended in 1988 making it a fully
protected species. Protection is also afforded by Schedule 2 of the Conservation
(Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations 1994, making the dormouse a European
Protected Species.
These two pieces of legislation operate in parallel, although
there are some small differences in scope and wording.
1.2.3
The WCA 1981 transposes into UK law the Convention on the Conservation of
European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (commonly referred to as the ‘Bern
Convention’). The 1981 Act has been amended several times, most recently by the
Countryside and Rights of Way ((CRoW)) Act 2000, which added ‘or recklessly’ to
Section 9(4)(a) and (b). Dormice are listed on Schedule 5 of the 1981 Act, and are
therefore subject to the provisions of Section 9, which makes it an offence to:
·
Intentionally kill, injure or take a dormouse ((Section 9(1)));
·
Possess or control any live or dead specimen or anything derived from a
dormouse ((S 9(2))) (unless it can be shown to have been legally acquired);
·
Intentionally or recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to any structure
or place used for shelter or protection by a dormouse ((S 9(4)(a))); and,
·
Intentionally or recklessly disturb a dormouse while it is occupying a structure
or place which it uses for that purpose ((S9(4)(b))).
1.2.4
The Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations (known as the Habitats
Regulations) transpose into UK law Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21st May 1992
on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (often
referred to as the ‘Habitats ((and Species)) Directive’). Dormice are listed on Annex
IV (‘European Protected Species’) of the Directive meaning that member states are
required to put in place a system of strict protection as outlined in Article 12; this is
done through inclusion on Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Regulation 39 makes it
an offence to:
·
Deliberately capture or kill a dormouse (Regulation 39(1)(a));
·
Deliberately disturb a dormouse (R. 39(1)(b));
·
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a dormouse (R. 39(1)(d));
and/or,
·
Keep, transport, sell or exchange, or offer for sale or exchange a live or dead
dormouse or any part of a dormouse (R. 39(2)).

Methodology
2.1
Desk study
2.1.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for dormouse, up to 2 km from
the Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (NE, 2017);
·
Dormouse records and records of locally designated sites for dormouse up to 2
km from the Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre
(SEWBReC);
·
Dormouse within the Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of
Biological Diversity in Wales;
·
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site using
Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle website
(WG and NRW, 2017);
·
Local knowledge of dormouse species and habitats from the County Ecologist;
·
Local knowledge of dormouse species and habitats from the South Wales
Mammal Group (SWMG) and,
·
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows,
watercourses, railway lines) using aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey
(OS) maps.
2.1.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and were reviewed.

Dormouse Survey
2.2.1
Dormouse surveys were undertaken paying due regard to the Dormouse
Conservation Handbook (Bright, et al., 2006).
Nest survey tubes (n=129) were
installed on 24 and 25 May 2017 in suitable habitat as shown in Figure 2.  The
survey tubes were retrieved on 20 November 2017.
2.2.2
Bright, et.al. (2006) provides guidance on survey effort requirements, using an
Index of Probability of finding dormice present in nest tubes in any one month. The
Index of Probability is based on using 50 nest tubes as a standard. A copy of The
Index of Probability scores is provided in Table 1.1.
2.2.3
Chanin and Woods (2003) recommend that assumed absence of dormice should
not be based on a Search Effort Score of less than 20. The Search Effort Score is
calculated by adding the Index of Probability scores for the months in which the
survey was undertaken. For example using the values in Table 2.1. If all surveys
were undertaken in all months the Search Effort Score would be 25.

Tubes were inspected in June, August, September October and November 2017
(see Section 1.5 in Limitations) for any presence of dormouse and any signs,
particularly for recently constructed nests. One licensed dormouse surveyor was
present during all visits.
Tube inspection was undertaken using flashlight or by
sliding the nest tube trays open.
Survey dates and personnel are given in Table

2.2.5
Using Table 2.1, the Search Effort Score for the 2017 dormouse surveys meets the
minimum score of 20. As the minimum score has been met and considering that the
number of tubes used for the surveys is greater than the minimum of 50 used to
calculate the Index of Probability score, the survey provides a robust assessment of
presence or likely absence of dormouse in the survey area.
2.3
Limitations
2.3.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.
2.3.2
Following best practice guidelines (Bright, et al., 2006) the best time to set out
dormouse tubes is in March and it is best to leave dormouse tubes out for an entire
season from March onwards, for checking in November. However this could not be
achieved as access to the suitable areas for dormouse nest tube deployment was
not granted until late May 2017 and time constraints of the Project meant that they
could not be left for an entire season.
However, the tubes were deployed and
surveyed within suitable survey months and will still be suitable to determine the
presence or absence of dormice within the Project Site. Furthermore, Chanin and
Woods (2003) identified that the length of time tubes are deployed is less important
than the time of year. Leaving them out from early March to the end of November
will give the highest probability of detecting dormice if they are present.  With a
minor peak of tube use in May and a more substantial one in August and
September, it would be best to ensure that tubes are installed no later than April
and finally checked no earlier than October. As an absolute minimum they
recommend that tubes are installed before the end of July and finally checked after
the end of September.  Given the evidence above and meeting the minimum
Search Effort Score of 20, the deployment of the nest tubes in May is not deemed
to be a significant limitation. A survey was not undertaken in July. Instead, two
surveys were undertaken in August; one at the beginning of the month and one at
the end of the month. Therefore, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.
2.3.3
On 26 June 2017 not all the tubes could be located due to extensive vegetation
cover; 93 tubes were checked on this occasion, on all other occasions all of the
tubes were checked.
On 29 August 2017 three tubes had to be repositioned as
they had fallen. On 29 September three tubes had to be repositioned as they had
fallen.
On 17 October 2017 it was noted that one of the tubes had fallen and
snapped in half. These incidents are not deemed to be a significant limitation.

Dormouse is listed on the Wales Section 7 list.
Surrounding Land
Use
The Project Site is located to the north of Junction 46 of the M4
Motorway close to the village of Felindre, Swansea.
The Project Site has agricultural fields to the east, south and
north. Areas of woodland are located to the south, east and west
of the Site.
Areas of the National Grid Power Station with
associated roads and buildings are partially within and adjacent to
the Project Site boundary. A water treatment works is located in
the north west outside of the Project Site boundary.
Previous Surveys
undertaken by BSG
Ecology
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys
undertaken in 2014 by BSG Ecology within the Site (ES Appendix
8.15).  The Site boundary included within these reports is different
to the 2017 Project Site boundary.
It was noted that the 2017 Project Site boundary is smaller than
the red line boundary used by BSG Ecology in 2014.  However,
the current Project Site boundary is within the same area as the
2014 red line boundary provided to BSG Ecology and therefore
the surveys undertaken would have captured the current Project
Site area.
The 2014 BSG Ecology Dormouse Report did not identify any
dormice or evidence of dormice in the 2014 survey period. A total
of 143 tubes were deployed across the months of May and June
2014, and checked on six occasions between the months of June
and November (ES Appendix 8.15).

Conclusions and Recomendations
4.1.1
No dormice or evidence of dormice have been identified within the Project Site.
4.1.2
Given the negative results of the field surveys from 2017, the negative results of the
BSG Ecology surveys from 2014 (ES Appendix 8.15), and the lack of records from
SEWBReC of dormouse from within 2 km it is likely that dormouse is absent from
the Project Site.
4.1.3
A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and will
be reported in the ES. At this stage it is anticipated that no further surveys will be
required for dormouse.
4.2
Recommendations for Mitigation
4.2.1
A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA and will be reported in the ES. At
this stage a European Protected Species Licence (EPSL) for dormice is not
required and no recommendations are required for mitigation as dormice are
considered likely absent from the Project Site.
4.3
Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
4.3.1
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made
during the EcIA and reported in the ES. At this stage the following preliminary
recommendations have been made for general biodiversity enhancements:
·
Maintain connectivity within the landscape by avoiding the severance of tree
lines, woodland edges, hedgerows and dense scrub; and,
·
Improve the connectivity of the Project Site by planting new hedgerows, infilling
current gaps in hedgerows with whips and creating green corridors. It is
recommended to use native species.
