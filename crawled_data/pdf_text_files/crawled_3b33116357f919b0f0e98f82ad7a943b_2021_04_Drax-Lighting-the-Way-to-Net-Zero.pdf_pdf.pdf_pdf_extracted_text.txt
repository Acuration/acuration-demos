At Drax we’re ready to act to level-up  
the North and deliver net zero. 
We’ve already transformed the UK’s  
biggest coal-fired power station into 
the largest decarbonisation project  
in Europe. Now we’re ready to deploy  
bioenergy with carbon capture and  
storage (BECCS) at scale, permanently  
removing millions of tonnes of carbon  
dioxide from the atmosphere every year.
We’ve proven the technology. We’ve kick- 
started the national planning process.  
We’re investing to get ready to build.
Help us act to create thousands of new  
green jobs, level-up the North and get  
the UK to net zero.

BECCS at Drax will help get the UK to net zero  
by 2050 faster and at lower cost. 
The experts agree. To tackle climate change and reach  
net zero, we need to remove carbon dioxide that’s already  
in the atmosphere.
•  By 2050 a significant volume of emissions will still  
be emitted by hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as 
agriculture and aviation. 
•  Negative emissions technologies will be essential  
to compensate for these residual emissions.
Now, new research by independent energy consultancy 
Baringa shows that deploying BECCS at Drax by 2027 is  
the most cost-efficient way of the UK achieving net zero. 
• According to Baringa, it will cost the UK £4.5bn less to 
achieve the 5th carbon budget if we deploy BECCS at Drax.

•  We have successfully piloted carbon capture projects  
since 2019.
•  In March, we kicked off the national planning consent 
process that means work to build BECCS could get 
underway at Drax as soon as 2024.
•  By 2027 our first BECCS unit could be operational, 
delivering the UK’s largest carbon capture project  
and a critical anchor for further carbon capture  
projects across the North of England.
•  By 2030 Drax could be permanently removing 8 million 
tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year, making  
Drax Power Station the first carbon negative power  
station in the world.
We need Government support to act:
•  A commitment by the end of this year that the UK will  
build the world’s first large-scale BECCS plant in the 2020s 
to give us the confidence to invest and progress our plans.
•  A clear policy framework which enables investment, 
rewards those removing carbon from the atmosphere and 
incentivises the hardest to abate sectors to invest in change.
Help us act now to tackle climate change by adding your 
voice to those calling for the Government to support BECCS.
Together we can help the UK reach net zero, level-up the 
Humber by creating tens of thousands of new green jobs  
and kick-start a UK-led global negative emissions industry.

The critical role of biomass and BECCS in reaching net zero is widely recognised including 
by the Climate Change Committee and the UK Government. The Government’s Energy White Paper  
commits to explore the role of BECCS, stating that:
 “Along with its ability to deliver negative emissions,  
this makes biomass one of our most valuable tools  
for reaching net zero emissions.”
