LONG-DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Key messages
•
KPMG was retained by Drax Corporate PLC to investigate whether any market challenges existed that may limit the development of long-duration 
energy storage and, if those challenges existed what options may exist to address those challenges
•
The GB energy transition to Net Zero by 2050 has the potential to result in the Electricity System Operator (ESO) having a greater requirement for 
flexible, long-duration1 storage and dispatchable plant:
•
The level and profile of electricity demand is changing as result of increasing uptake of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and electric space heating;
•
Increased renewable generation, and its intermittency, has the potential to increase the ESO’s requirement for dispatchable generation;
•
Flexible, long-duration storage has a role in managing these two trends.
•
A limited number of market characteristics can present challenges to securing efficient finance for long-duration storage projects, specifically:
•
Revenue and cost uncertainty;
•
Long lead times for project development; and
•
High up front capital expenditure requirements.
•
It is generally accepted that there are a number of options for market intervention to support flexibility and long-duration storage: including RAV 
models, contracts for Differences (CfDs), a modified form of the capacity mechanism, a cap and floor regime.
•
An assessment of these available options using a set of selection criteria is presented on page 8. Based on this assessment while most approaches 
have some advantages, a cap and floor revenue support mechanism has the potential to be suitable for long-duration storage projects because:
•
It can address the market challenges described above without distorting the market;
•
It is an approach recognised by investors (and the regulator) given its application elsewhere in the sector (e.g. interconnectors); and
•
It would incentivise the asset to be operated in accordance with system need and maximum efficiency.
•
A cap and floor mechanism will require a number of specific design features to reflect the nature of flexibility and long duration storage projects. 
Specifically:
•
Pass through the costs of charging/pumping;
•
Flexibility to reflect the different long-duration storage technologies; and
•
Ensuring revenue stabilisation does not reduce incentives to deliver market efficient outcomes.
1. We recognise that a formal definition of long-duration storage is yet to be formulated by BEIS and for the purposes of this analysis we regard long-duration storage as aligning with BEIS comment that 
“storage across days, weeks and months could greatly reduce the costs of reaching Net Zero” BEIS (2021) “Facilitation the deployment of large-scale and long-duration electricity storage: call for 
evidence.”

LONG-DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Net Zero is likely to require more flexible, long-duration storage
The level and profile of electricity demand is changing…
•
Government’s 10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution aims to 
accelerate deployment of Low Carbon Technologies (LCTs). 
•
The deployment of EVs and heat pumps in particular, is expected to 
accelerate over the coming decade and beyond and will impact peak 
demand. 
•
By 2050, peak demand is estimated (by the National Grid Energy 
System Operator - ESO) to be at least 30GW higher than current 
levels, and over 50GW higher in a world of high heat pump uptake.
… and the focus on renewable generation increases 
intermittency…
•
Government is targeting 40GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030.
•
Increasing wind capacity and reductions in capacity of other 
dispatchable plant has the effect of making less dispatchable 
generation available to the ESO (see right)
•
Greater variability of demand on the transmission network will 
emerge, resulting from some renewables being connected to 
distribution, exacerbating the balancing challenge for the ESO.
ESO balancing costs are already increasing to manage the 
situation: Year-to-date balancing costs in 2020-21 stand at £1.68bn; 
close to 30% higher than 2019-20 and over 40% higher than 2018-19.

LONG-DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Net Zero potentially requires more flexible, long-duration storage
The ESO is already forecasting an increasing requirement for long-
duration storage
•
National Grid Future Energy Scenarios (FES) projects an increase 
from 2.8 GW storage capacity today to between 4.5 GW (Steady 
Progression) and 15 GW (Leading the Way) by 2050.  This is 
additional to Vehicle to Grid (V2G) or battery storage.
•
In the ESO FES analysis, 37-45% of storage (GW) is modelled as 
long-duration storage, with an additional 1.5 GW of pumped hydro 
needed by early 2030s. 
Long duration storage also has the potential for system wide 
economic benefits: 
•
Long-duration storage and flexibility, such as Pumped Storage 
Hydro (PSH), can help the ESO manage the system (and keep 
costs to consumers under control) in a variety of different ways, 
including by providing stability services and by reducing the 
curtailment of wind. 
•
According to Imperial College, investment in long-duration 
flexibility can help to reduce total system costs by between £44m 
and £316m per annum by 2050, depending on the amount and 
location of long-duration flexibility deployed.

Market challenges may limit financeability of long-duration storage
Barrier
Description
Implication for project
Revenue 
uncertainty
Revenues from the provision of flexibility and long-duration storage 
services can be uncertain and volatile with no longer term certainty 
regarding the levels of likely revenues.
In assessing whether to provide debt financing for a project (and at what cost) debt 
providers analyse what are likely to be the minimum available cashflows from the 
project available to cover the interest payments on any loans due. Variable or uncertain 
revenues or costs may result in uncertainty over cashflows available to service any 
debt in the project which may explain why such projects have faced challenges 
securing finance to date.
Cashflow 
uncertainty
Long-duration storage projects (such as PSH) face variable costs of 
charging, such as pumping of water back up to the reservoir.  The 
price of the energy to do this is driven by the market, can be highly 
variable and therefore also has an effect on the uncertainty of 
cashflows.
Long project 
development 
lead times
For some long-duration storage projects (such as PSH) there can 
be long project development lead times (e.g. 5 to 7 years) and over 
this period it is not certain as to what revenues the developer will 
earn once operational (see below.)
Without an understanding of the likely revenue profile, lenders may potentially be 
unwilling to provide debt finance to project developers.
High capital 
requirements
New-build long-duration flexibility is capital intensive. On its own 
the cost of new-build long-duration flexibility is high. On its own 
this is not an investment barrier. However, a high capex 
requirement compounds the revenue uncertainty and cashflow 
uncertainty and further increases the risk profile of the project.
Projects with high capital costs combined with revenue and cashflow uncertainty are 
likely to have a risk profile which exceeds the level of risk at which investors or lenders 
are willing to provide finance2.

Potential approaches to address the market challenges
Regime Type
High-level description
Contract for 
Difference
If wholesale power prices fall below a defined level during 
certain time periods, providers receive a £MWh strike-price 
for electricity discharged onto the system.
RAV Model
Long-duration storage assets become directly regulated 
with allowed revenues determined by Ofgem based on a 
Regulated Asset Value (RAV) and a regulated allowed cost 
of capital.
Reformed 
Capacity 
Market
The existing capacity market (CM) could be reformed to 
send stronger long-term price signals for low-carbon 
flexibility. This could include a new T-[x] auction for 
technologies with longer lead times. It could also include 
split auctions allocating low carbon capacity first, allowing a 
potentially higher clearing price.
Cap and Floor
Revenues (or margins) are subject to minimum and 
maximum levels. Below the ‘floor’ customers would top-up 
revenues, and earnings above the ‘cap’ would be returned 
(in whole or in part) to customers.
•
Based on existing literature and our understanding of the GB 
energy market, we identified existing regime types with 
potential to address the investment barriers identified on the 
previous page;
•
The four shortlisted options are described in the table to the 
right
•
We also considered:
•
A ‘Market-only’ model: this would have the potential to 
perpetuate the financing issues for long-duration storage 
that we observe today; and
•
Directly funded grants, these did not necessarily have 
the potential to meet Government value for money 
criteria.

LONG DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Below is the framework we used to evaluate the four options to identify a preferred regime type to overcome the financeability challenges 
facing capital intensive long-duration storage and flexibility projects. This assessment framework is based on a range of published 
Government and Ofgem documents regarding the selection of appropriate energy policy options3.
Assessing the approaches: framework
Advancing the low carbon economy
In the places which stand to benefit 
the most by boosting productivity and 
driving regional growth.
Maintaining security of supply
Protecting the delivery of energy to 
consumers is a welfare issue which 
transcends cost and decarbonisation 
challenges on the political agenda. 
Achieving value for money
Costs to implement and run must be 
outweighed by benefits to consumers 
through lower bills; can include through 
long-term economic benefits of a low 
carbon economy.
Levelling up: Jobs & Investment
This transition to Net Zero provides 
Government with a real opportunity to 
invest in regions across the UK to grow 
jobs and investment. 
Incentivise efficiency
Compatible with price signals that 
promote short run efficiency (best 
utilisation of existing assets) as well as 
low long run marginal cost in new 
technologies.
Avoid market distortions
The GB power market has multiple 
existing and overlapping market 
frameworks. This regime needs to 
interact with these without inefficient 
or distortive market behaviours. 
Risk apportionment
Allocation of technology and delivery 
risk should be appropriately distributed 
across consumers, industry and 
government.
Competitive pressure
The regime should reveal the best 
solutions and should be: technology 
neutral; compatible with competitive 
tendering; have a pipeline of potential 
participants.
Demonstrate 
that the 
proposed 
regime for 
long-duration 
storage and 
flexibility can 
meet 
requirements 
of policy-
makers, 
investors, and 
customers
Facilitate system needs
The regime needs to support new 
projects in a way that maximises 
delivery of future system needs. This is 
core to justification of the case for 
intervention.
Complexity (and cost) to establish
Regimes which are complex and costly 
to develop are less likely to gain 
traction; unless they have a clear and 
significantly better benefits case than 
alternatives.
Address the market challenge
The regime and design need to 
effectively address the market failure –
i.e. solve the problem faced by long-
duration storage projects.
…align with wider government energy 
and economic policy objectives.
… take into account market 
fundamentals…
A suitable regime 
must…
… be deliverable and effective at 
bringing forward new long-duration 
storage and flexibility…
The first three criteria regarding effectiveness and 
deliverability are treated as ‘essential’. 
Any regime-type scoring a ‘red’ against one of 
these is considered not suitable, irrespective of 
how it scores against the remaining criteria.

LONG DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Assessing the approaches: findings
A Cap and Floor income stabilisation mechanism has a number of 
characteristics that have the potential to address the market challenges 
facing capital intensive long duration energy storage projects. The basis 
behind our analysis is summarised below.
•
The Cap and Floor regime has the potential to provide sufficient certainty 
to investors that income will cover the cost of debt which has the potential 
for unlocking finance for new projects to go ahead.
•
While a reformed Capacity Mechanism can provide stable minimum 
revenue streams, it is not the preferred option because CM-payments 
appear unlikely to be sufficient to service debt costs for large-scale 
investment (see the summary of our analysis on page 14.)
•
The RAV-model may be unlikely to provide sufficient incentives for asset 
operators to respond to market signals and carries minimal competitive 
pressure to drive efficiency. 
•
Contract for Difference (CFD) has the potential to be unsuitable because 
this type of regime typically incentivises export of power irrespective of 
market conditions and therefore may not reflect the operating 
characteristics (or value) of storage assets. Equally a Dispatchable CFD (as 
being considered for Power CCS projects) is likely to be overly complex 
and risk market distortion.

Regime type strongly aligns with the criteria. Or, where the regime type does not align with the criteria, potential mitigations are easily identifiable.
Regime type does not fully align with the criteria but mitigations are possible. However, potential mitigations may either only partially resolve the issue or may be 
complex to implement. 
Regime type does not align with the criteria and suitable mitigations not readily identifiable.
The regime type neither algins with nor undermines the criteria relative to the status quo.

LONG DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Developing cap and floor for long-duration storage
The Cap and Floor regime currently in operation for 
interconnectors has been successful in attracting private 
sector investment into the sector.
A similar regime would be beneficial in facilitating 
investment into long-duration storage and flexibility. 
However, there are specific design issues to consider:
•
The costs of “charging” storage, should be excluded 
from the Cap and Floor and netted off from revenue.
This is because these costs tend to be determined by 
the market and are therefore unpredictable. This cost 
unpredictability (shown for Cruachan 1 in the figure to 
the right) together with volatility of revenue is unlikely to 
secure finance.
•
The assessment framework for projects in their 
development phases and eligibility criteria need to 
be specified with an element of flexibility to adapt to 
the wide range of available long-duration storage
and flexibility solutions that could be made available 
under the scheme.
•
A mechanism (a ‘system efficiency incentive’) will be 
needed to incentivise operators’ to ensure efficient 
operation of the asset and maximising system and 
consumer benefits.
A framework of this design is likely to significantly increase 
the potential for projects to access cost effective debt 
funding and allow the project development to move 
forwards.

LONG DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Implementation
The regime would be awarded to projects via an administrative 
process led by Ofgem.
•
We are proposing that the award process would include three stages, 
similar to the existing interconnector cap and floor regime:
•
Initial assessment;
•
Cost assessment; and 
•
Post-construction review.
•
An administrative process is likely to be more appropriate:
•
Long-duration projects tend to have diverse characteristics 
making competition challenging; and
•
Ofgem would assess the cost benefit of the proposed 
projects to ensure alignment with the regime objective and 
value for money to consumers. 
•
The regime would be available to developers through application 
windows to be set by the regulator.
•
The award process would be supported by annual reporting both 
during the construction and operation phases.
•
Aligning the implementation of a cap and floor regime for long-
duration storage with existing regimes (such as for interconnectors) 
has the advantage of being understood and trusted by developers 
and investors.
•
The implementation of the process will be subject to delivery of legal 
and regulatory approval.

Summary 
•
The cap and floor regime may offer a relatively straightforward solution to the current market challenges;
•
It may have the potential to  de-risk investment, enabling cheaper financing, without unduly favouring or subsidising a particular asset type; and
•
It is complementary to the existing market framework, avoiding distortion and incentivising efficient system outcomes.

LONG DURATION STORAGE: INCOME STABILISATION MECHANISM
Cap and Floor versus Reformed Capacity Market
A Cap and Floor is expected to be a more economic and effective means of supporting long-duration flexibility  than a reformed CM. 
We understand that there is an increasing debate in the industry and with policy makers as to whether modifications to the existing CM would be a 
sufficient long term solution to the issue of revenue support for long-duration storage. Further development of the CM to reflect the changing 
requirements of the energy market is likely to be necessary given the extent and nature of the changes required to deliver Net Zero by 2050. In the 
specific case of support for long-duration flexibility, there are additional merits associated with a revenue Cap and Floor (which is complementary to the 
CM)  compared with a CM-only approach. These are set out below.
Reformed Capacity Mechanism 
Cap and Floor
Solves 
market 
failure
•
Long-duration flexibility can provide a range of services but may not be able to bid 
economically into a capacity mechanism at a price that is cost effective on a capacity-only 
basis. As such, long-duration would not necessarily receive support in a competition design to 
procure capacity at lowest cost.
•
This is demonstrated by the fact that existing clearing prices have been insufficient to address 
the market failure of providing the revenue certainty required to unlock financing for long-
duration flexibility projects. 
•
Addressing this draw-back would impact on the value for money delivered through a capacity 
mechanism. 
•
Under a Cap and Floor, only the absolute 
minimum level of underwriting is provided 
by customers to enable financing 
requirements to be met. 
•
The regime is set on the basis that assets 
are competing across multiple revenue 
streams – including provision of capacity. 
This provides improved value for money 
for customers compared with relying 
solely on the capacity mechanism.
•
In addition, the 25 year time horizon of the 
proposed Cap and Floor also spreads the 
underwriting of the capital costs over a 
longer period, reducing the potential 
burden to customers in any single year. 
Value for 
money
•
A reformed capacity mechanism could be developed to enable long-duration flexibility to 
compete successfully (for example through separate auction pots - similar to the CFD ‘Pot 
2’). This would result in a higher clearing price for these technologies. 
•
This could enable a clearing price that is high enough to meet the minimum requirements for 
financing. However, in years where other non-capacity revenues streams are sufficient, 
consumer payments under the CM to long-duration flexibility would be uneconomic (i.e.  
consumers would be overpaying for the capacity procured through the CM). 
Facilitate 
system needs
•
A capacity mechanism is focused on ensuring the provision of sufficient capacity to meet 
peak demand. Therefore, an efficient CM would not bring forward any flexibility of greater 
than 4 hours, unless high de-rating factors are applied across the curve. 
•
The proposed Cap and Floor approach 
targets those projects that have the 
technical capabilities to provide a range of 
system benefits and actively appraises the 
value of these to consumers through the 
CBA and Ofgem-led assessment process.
