Drax Supplier / Third Party Privace Notice
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT?
This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) is intended to provide information 
regarding how any personal information we collect from you 
or from third parties about you during and after your working 
relationship with us will be processed within the Drax Group 
of companies. It relates to personal data (defined under 
data protection law) about you that we refer to as personal 
information in this document.  Most of our third-party suppliers 
are corporate entities (i.e. limited companies or a public limited 
company), in which case this Notice does not apply as it does 
not relate to corporate information. However, it does apply 
to individuals within or connected with such an entity (e.g. 
employees, directors, shareholders, etc.) if they provide a Drax 
company with personal information.
WHO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION 
Companies operating under Drax Group plc are the joint data 
controllers of personal information provided by or collected 
about you. This means that we are responsible for deciding how 
we hold and use personal information about you and that we 
are required to notify you of the information contained in this 
notice. It is important that you read this notice so that you are 
aware of how and why we are using your personal information 
and how we will treat it. Depending on the circumstances, we 
may on occasion provide you with a shorter privacy notice to 
cover specific types of processing that will be supplemented by 
this notice. 
This Notice applies to current and former suppliers or other 
third parties. This Notice does not form part of any contract 
to provide goods or services. We may update this Notice at 
any time, so you are advised to review this Notice at regular 
intervals.
 It is important that you read this Notice, together with any 
other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions 
when we are collecting or processing personal information 
about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using 
such information.
Please read this Notice as if it’s from the Company you entered/
or are potentially entering into a contractual arrangement with 
directly or on behalf of another entity. However, your personal 
information may also be shared within our group of companies 
(our “group companies”) and so, in this Notice, references to ‘we’ 
or ‘us’ mean the Company and our group companies.
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting 
your personal information.  Our Group Data Protection Officer 
is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this 
Notice.  If you have any questions about this Notice, please 
use the contact details set out at the end of this Notice in the 
“Contacting Us” section.

interests and fundamental rights do not override those 
interests;

Drax Supplier / Third Party Privace Notice
assess creditworthiness and, check your identity, manage your 
account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. 
CRAs will share your information with other organisations. The 
identities of the CRAs, and the ways in which they use and

This includes data sourced from the Electoral Register, 
plus fraud prevention and credit information organisations 
- including details of previous credit applications and your 
payment history - and public information such as County Court 
Judgements, and bankruptcies. 
When a credit check is carried out on you, your credit records 
will be searched, along with any financially associated 
individuals such as your spouse or partner when you are a sole 
trader. The CRA will keep a record of this search and place a 
“footprint” on your credit file. 
The information we provide to CRAs about you, such as details 
of false or inaccurate information provided by you, or if we 
suspect fraud, may be provided to other organisations and used 
by them to: 
•  help make decisions, for example when managing credit and 
credit-related accounts or facilities; 
• detect and prevent crime, fraud and money laundering; 
• check your credit history; 
• verify your identity; 
• trace your whereabouts; and 
• undertake research, statistical analysis and systems testing.

service, fraud detection and compliance with our regulatory 
requirements*/**/***.

ways:

We will not carry out any solely automated decision making 
using your personal information. 
CHANGE OF PURPOSE 
We will only use your personal information for the purposes 
for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider 
that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is 
compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your 
personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will usually 
notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us 
to do so. 
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION 
We may share your personal information with the third parties 
set out below for the purposes described above: 
•  service providers (generally based in the UK) such as those 
who provide IT and system administration services  
• third party due diligence system providers
•  other companies in our Group of companies who provide 
security, IT and system administration services and 
undertake management reporting and statistical analysis 
to improve our product and service offering
•  if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal 
information in order to comply with any legal obligation), 
requirement of our regulators (including Ofgem), industry 
code, or in order to enforce or apply our contract with you 
•  in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in 
which case we may (where relevant) disclose your personal 
information to the prospective seller or buyer 
•  if we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a 
third party, in which case personal information held by us 
will be one of the transferred assets 
•  to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our 
customers and others. This includes exchanging 
information with other organisations such as fraud and 
theft prevention agencies for the purposes of reducing 
credit risk, fraud and energy theft. 
• to a donations management organisation in support of the 
Drax Foundation
We require all service providers and Group companies that we 
share your personal information with to respect the privacy 
and security of your personal information and to treat it in 
accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party 
service providers, including Group companies, to use your 
personal information for their own purposes and only permit 
them to process your personal information for specified 
4
Drax Supplier / Third Party Privace Notice
purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 
Where a service provider is based outside Canada, Japan and 
the UK, they are required to comply with the data protection 
law. If that is the case, we ensure a similar degree of protection 
is afforded by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards 
is implemented:
•  we will only transfer your personal information to countries 
that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of 
protection for personal information by the relevant  
regulator; or 
•  where we use certain service providers who are not in a 
‘adequate’ country, we may use specific contracts approved 
by the regulator which give personal information the same 
protection it has in the Canada, Japan and the UK  as 
required.
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of Canada, 
Japan and the UK, please contact us using the details set out in 
the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this Notice. 
STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
We will only keep your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose(s) we collected it for, as 
set out above in this notice, and for as long as we are required 
to keep it for legal purposes. 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal 
information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity 
of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from 
unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the 
purposes for which we process your personal information and 
whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, 
and the applicable legal requirements. 
For example, by law, for tax purposes, we have to keep basic 
information about our third parties (including contact, identity, 
financial and transactional data) for six years after they cease 
being in contract. 
In some circumstances: 
•  you can ask us to delete your personal information, see “Your 
Rights” below for further details; and 
•  we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can 
no-longer be associated with you) for research or statistical 
purposes, in which case we may use this information 
indefinitely without further notice to you. 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to 
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
who have a business need to know that information. They will 
only process your personal information on our instructions and 
they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
personal information breach and will notify you and any 
applicable regulator where appropriate. 
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND
RESTRICTION
Your duty to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal information we hold about 
you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your 
personal information changes during your working relationship 
with us.
Your rights in connection with personal information 
Data protection laws provide you with rights when your data 
is processed in Canada, Japan and the UK. Where you are not 
entitled to exercise a right, we will consider your request and 
feedback accordingly. 
• Request information about how and with who your personal 
information is being used or shared (Canada, Japan and the 
UK); 
•  Request access to your personal information. This enables 
you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold 
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it 
(Canada, Japan and the UK); 
• Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected (Canada, 
Japan and the UK).
•  Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good reason 
for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to 
ask us to delete or remove your personal information where 
you have exercised your right to object to processing (see 
below). However, this is not an absolute right and there 
will be circumstances where we are required to retain your 
personal information even if you are no longer working with 
us (Canada, Japan and the UK);  
• Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask 
us to suspend the processing of personal information about 
you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or 
the reason for processing (UK only); 
•  Request the transfer of your personal information to yourself 
or another party (UK only).
You also have the Right to Object to the processing of your 
personal information where we are relying on a legitimate 
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about 
your particular situation which makes you want to object to 
processing on this ground (Japan and the UK). 
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this notice.
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any time 
to the regulator for data protection issues as follows:
UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for  
British Columbia
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for Alberta

Drax Supplier / Third Party Privace Notice
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your 
concerns before you approach the regulator, so please contact 
us in the first instance using the contact details set out below.
You also have a right to request a file review by the regulator 
(Canada only).
No fee usually required
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we 
may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly 
unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply 
with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it.
Timing of our response
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 
days. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your 
request is particularly complex or you have made a number of 
requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided 
your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your 
personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right 
to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any 
time (UK and Canada).
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details 
in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this notice. Once 
we have received notification that you have withdrawn your 
consent, we will no longer process your information for the 
purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have 
another legitimate basis for doing so in law.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE  
We reserve the right to update this Notice at any time, and we 
will provide you with a new Notice when we make any material 
updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time 
about the processing of your personal information.
