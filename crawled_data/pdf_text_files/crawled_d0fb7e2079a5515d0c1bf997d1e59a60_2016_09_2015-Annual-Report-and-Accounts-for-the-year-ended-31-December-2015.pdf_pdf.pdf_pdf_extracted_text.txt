What’s the challenge?
Coal is a fossil fuel and damaging to 
our environment. But it still provides 
around 25% of UK electricity and, 
across the world, there is ever-more 
demand for energy. 
We need new sources of electricity, ones that do not 
cause climate change. But building new power stations 
can be a long and costly process. 
There is an alternative: we can shift from coal to an 
innovative, renewable energy source without taking 
all the existing power stations off the grid and we can 
do this today.
For the last ten years Drax has been developing the 
capability to achieve this and today it is now optimised 
with the latest technology. With the right support we 
can further enhance and deploy to ultimately become 
a fully biomass-fuelled generator. 
Yet, until we are able to fully upgrade to biomass, 
our coal units will remain a critical part of the UK 
generating infrastructure.

Our biomass journey 
Carbon dioxide emissions (million tonnes)

What’s our solution?
Our answer to the problem 
of coal is sustainable biomass
At Drax we have upgraded and 
converted half of our power 
station using the very latest 
in biomass technology to use 
compressed wood pellets 
instead of coal. 
This has nearly halved our carbon emissions, making 
us Europe’s single largest decarbonisation project. 
It has also dramatically reduced other air pollutants 
including nitrogen oxides.
And because we are reusing and upgrading existing 
infrastructure, our transition has been faster and more 
affordable than it would have been if we had to build 
expensive new power stations in new locations.
80%
At Drax the use of biomass saves 
more than 80% of the carbon 
dioxide emitted when compared 
to the use of coal

We now have three generating 
units using sustainable biomass

Rebecca Heaton
Head of Sustainability 
and Policy
Why are our wood pellets low carbon? 
When any form of biomass is combusted the 
carbon emitted is equal to that absorbed 
during its growth. Sourcing biomass from 
sustainably managed working forests helps 
maintain, and can increase, our planet’s 
long-term carbon stocks. There are small 
amounts of emissions associated with the 
processing and transportation of our 
compressed wood pellets but even taking 
these into account the carbon savings at Drax 
are more than 80% compared to coal.
What is biomass?
Biomass is material obtained from plants 
that can be used to generate electricity or heat. 
A key benefit of biomass is that it’s renewable 
and if sourced correctly, both sustainable and 
low carbon. The bulk of the biomass we use at 
Drax is wood which we transform into high 
density, compressed wood pellets.
Rebecca worked on this
As Group Head of Sustainability,  
Rebecca makes sure that the biomass  
we source is sustainable and making 
significant reductions to our 
carbon emissions.

What’s our solution?
Latest advanced technology
For more than a decade 
Drax has been leading the 
world in the development of 
new technology, techniques 
and processes to enable 
the sustainable sourcing, 
generation and supply 
of electricity from 
sustainable biomass. 
From plant to plug our original design, development 
and implementation of an innovative and wholly 
new means to generate electricity, using our oldest 
renewable energy source, has made a significant 
contribution to the carbon reduction targets of the 
UK and with it the lives of people across the UK 
and beyond. 
We take low-value wood and turn it into a higher 
density fuel that is easy to transport and which, in 
our upgraded and converted power station, is able 
to generate reliable, renewable energy precisely 
when it’s needed.
Working with universities
We have partnered with some 
of the UK’s leading universities on 
the many challenges we have had 
to overcome. One example is with 
the optimal use of additives to 
prevent fouling of the boilers. 
Manufacturing a strong pellet
Our US manufacturing sites make 
use of vertically-stacked mills to 
limit pellet handling prior to 
cooling. This results in a more 
durable pellet that is less likely 
to deteriorate as it is moved 
through our supply chain. 
05
Drax Group plc

Laser technology
We have deployed the very latest in laser 
scanning technology within our biomass boiler 
upgrades to achieve a superior understanding 
of how wood pellets combust. With this 
information we have been able to achieve 
incremental reductions in air pollutants 
throughout the generation process. This also 
helps us optimise our biomass units to achieve 
an efficiency similar to that of coal.
Materials handling
To achieve the desired level of process safety 
we chose to pneumatically convey the pellets 
on a scale previously thought impossible. Our 
biomass storage domes are also the world’s 
largest and the first time the technology has 
been used in the UK.
Reducing and reusing dust
Our US facilities are designed to reduce 
and recycle dust produced during the 
pellet manufacturing process. For example, 
dust containment systems limit employee 
exposure and mitigate potentially hazardous 
build-ups of dust. Our production sites also 
screen pellets at various stages of the 
manufacturing process to separate and 
recycle dust and fines.

Using the very latest technology and 
process engineering thinking, Jason has 
played a critical role in redesigning our 
generating units, allowing them to be 
upgraded from coal to biomass.

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
What’s our solution?
Sustainably sourced biomass
We only source from working 
forests that grow back and 
stay as forests. 
Our biomass is precisely manufactured to a high 
density so it’s easy to transport in bulk. Because of this, 
we can go outside Britain to the places that have huge, 
well established working forests and source low-grade 
and low-value material from forests that also supply 
local wood-based industries, such as construction, 
furniture and flooring. 
Our biggest suppliers are in North America: until 
recently it would have been too expensive to make 
use of this surplus wood, now we can take it across the 
Atlantic for a remarkably low cost. Even including the 
small remaining carbon emissions in our supply chain, 
our conversion still cuts our carbon emissions by more 
than 80% overall compared to coal.
And, just as we can go to the places with lots of low-
value wood because of our advanced technology, 
we can also choose who we don’t want to work with.
Our principles
1
We never work in countries that lack 
proper regulation.
2
We never cause deforestation or forest decline. 
3
We never source from areas that are officially 
protected or where our activities harm 
endangered species.
4
We only take wood from working forests that 
grow back and stay as forests. 
5
We require all our suppliers to pass tough 
screening and sustainability audits, conducted 
by independent auditors.

We devoted a great deal of time and effort to identifying 
the best locations for our two US pellet manufacturing 
facilities to ensure our sourcing would be sustainable. 
Our most important conditions included: access to 
low-grade wood; proximity to modern infrastructure; 
and availability of trained loggers, wood hauliers and 
other specialists to support our operations.

Richard Peberdy 
Vice President, Sustainability
Drax Biomass
Our sites at Amite, Mississippi 
and Morehouse, Louisiana, with 
abundant pine resources, meet 
these conditions. Both catchments 
have suffered the recent departure 
of other forest products-based 
industries and were therefore in 
need of new markets to support 
their existing wood supply 
and workforce. 
Having selected these sites, 
we met with local forest owners 
and other stakeholders to better 
understand their interests and to 
communicate our values. We firmly 
believe in ensuring that our core 
values and our commitments 
to sustainability, align with and 
support the communities in which 
we operate. We also partnered with 
third party organisations such as 
NatureServe, a conservation 
planning service, to ensure we 
avoid sourcing wood from areas 
of high conservation value.
As a result of these efforts, we 
now have a secure and reliable 
supply chain that meets all our 
sustainability requirements. We 
also maintain full chain-of-custody 
for all sourced material, a practice 
that is verified through 
independent audit.

What’s our solution?
Bringing the UK closer 
to the European average 
for use of biomass
The use of wood for energy 
is nothing new – in fact 
it’s our oldest form of 
renewable energy.
What is different today is how Drax is using the very 
latest technology to turn low-grade wood into a modern 
and highly efficient fuel. Today, Britain is well behind the 
European average in its use of wood for energy and 
much lower than Germany or Sweden for example, as 
shown in the chart below.
Taking steps to get closer to that European average 
is the fastest, most affordable and reliable way for the 
UK to move away from the fossil fuels of the past to 
the renewable energy sources of the future.
 100%
Drax is aiming to have all its sourcing 
volume SBP certified
Sustainable Biomass Partnership (SBP)
This industry-led initiative formed in 2013, 
provides assurance that woody biomass is 
sourced from legal and sustainable sources. 
In 2015 Ofgem benchmarked SBP as being fully 
compliant with the UK’s Renewables Obligation, 
which means that any wood pellets certified as 
SBP compliant meet the government’s 
mandatory sustainability criteria for 
woody biomass. 
“As a founding member of the SBP, Drax has 
played a key role in developing the SBP 
Framework certification standards. The 
standards have been designed to provide 
assurance that feedstocks are derived only 
from forests which are legally harvested and 
sustainably managed.”

Chairman’s statement
Drax is the world leader in biomass 
technology and I am excited by the 
opportunities this will present the Group.
In my first year as Chairman it has certainly 
been challenging for the Group. However, the 
progress we made to complete our conversion 
to a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator 
was excellent and more than ever Drax showed 
the essential part it has to play in the UK’s 
future energy mix.
The operational performance across the 
business was strong and in 2016 we will 
complete the transformation we began some 
10 years ago. The business we have today is 
more diverse, built on a dedicated supply chain 
and backed by world-leading innovation and 
technology. It continues to deliver around 8% 
of the UK’s electricity needs, while providing 
an excellent service to our retail customers.
Political and regulatory changes
During the year the government applied the 
Climate Change Levy (“CCL”) to renewables and 
announced a potential timeline for the closure 
of coal generating plant. The former had a 
significant negative impact on our 2015 results, 
reducing EBITDA by an estimated £30 million, 
and this impact will be double for 2016. 
Philip Cox CBE
Chairman 
Many years ago Drax recognised that to limit 
climate change would require an eventual end 
to the use of coal generation – that is why we 
embarked on our transformation to become 
a predominantly biomass fuelled generator. 
In 2010 our power station burnt almost 
10 million tonnes of coal. Because of 
our transformation by 2015 we had 
lowered this to six million tonnes. 
But we don’t want to keep burning coal and 
we don’t have to. There are other options.
Greater use of sustainably sourced biomass is 
the fastest, safest and most affordable means 
by which the UK can move away from coal and 
support greater use of wind and solar in 
the future. 
With the right policy frameworks we could 
become 100% renewable through the full 
conversion of our three remaining coal units 
and we could do this well before 2025. We will 
continue to work closely with the government 
to help them quickly reduce the UK’s reliance 
on coal.

Critical infrastructure 
Drax remains an essential part of the energy 
mix. Our ability to generate reliable, affordable, 
renewable power and deliver this to a broad 
range of customers places the Group at the 
heart of the UK’s power generation. In turn, this 
creates long-term value for our shareholders – 
we remain focused on optimising this value 
as well as remaining alert to opportunities for 
growth. In this regard we await the outcome of 
the EU State aid decision during the year. 
Securing the Contract for Difference (CfD) is a 
key component of our investment case.
Results and dividend
Our earnings (EBITDA) for 2015 of £169 million 
were, as expected, below those of 2014 (£229 
million). This result was adversely impacted by 
the dramatic fall in commodity prices and the 
loss of Levy Exempt Certificate (“LEC”) income 
from August, but it is pleasing to note that the 
shortfall this created was partially offset by our 
self-help measures. Our capital investment 
programme (£174 million) was delivered on 
schedule, whilst we retained strong control 
over operating costs. The refinancing of our 
£400 million Revolving Credit Facility helped 
us maintain a robust balance sheet.
In accordance with our dividend policy, the 
Board proposes a final dividend in respect 
of 2015 of 0.6 pence per share, equivalent to 
£2 million. This would give total dividends for 
the year of £23 million (2014: £48 million).
Corporate governance
At Drax we are committed to excellent 
corporate governance and given the changes 
and challenges experienced during the year 
the Board and Committees remained very 
active. Details can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 56.
The year ended with a number of changes to the 
Board. My predecessor Charles Berry left after 
our AGM in April. Tony Quinlan left the Group in 
June and was replaced as CFO by Will Gardiner, 
who joined us in November. Paul Taylor and 
Peter Emery, both executive directors, resigned 
at the end of December, with Andy Koss 
appointed to the Board effective from 1 January 
2016. I would like to thank Charles, Tony, Paul and 
Peter for their contribution over many years of 
service and welcome Will and Andy to the Board.
We have an effective Board with 
complementary skills, knowledge and 
experience. We will continue to look at how 
we can strengthen this mix during the year. 
Our people
I have reflected on some of the challenges 
we faced during the year, but there were also 
many positives, several of which are described 
in this report. This is in large part down to the 
dedication and hard work of our people, in 
every part of the business. We are fortunate 
to employ a workforce with a diverse range 
of skills and experience, unified by their 
commitment to decarbonising the UK and in 
making Drax successful. I look forward to 
working with them over the year ahead.
Finally, I would like to say how delighted I am 
to be Chairman of Drax. The Company is at a 
pivotal point in its development, coinciding 
with a critically important time for UK energy 
policy. We are confident and determined 
that our reliable, renewable and affordable 
generation and supply will be at the heart of 
UK energy for the long term.

Q&A 
In the spotlight
Dorothy Thompson answers some of the key 
questions raised by shareholders during the 
course of 2015 and addresses some of the 
important issues facing the Group.
Q. How would you describe the 
performance of Drax in 2015?
A. This was a poor year for our shareholders. 
Our financial performance disappointed due 
to a number of external factors, primarily the 
collapse in commodity prices, which affected 
most companies in the energy sector, and 
changes to established government policy. 
What made it especially frustrating for me was 
that operationally, the business performed as 
well as it has ever done. The Group took steps 
throughout the year to offset the financial 
challenges we face, not least in reviewing 
and reducing future operational and capital 
spend, optimising revenue from our coal units 
and introducing new customer products. I 
expect further progress on these and other 
areas in 2016.
Q. It is widely acknowledged that 
Drax’s biomass conversion was a 
bold step. In light of recent changes 
to government policy on renewable 
energy was it still the right thing for 
the Group to do?
A. Absolutely, both for us as a business and for 
the UK with the significant carbon reductions 
Drax is achieving. The UK government is fully 
committed to the current biomass generation 
capacity. We firmly believe that with the urgency 
to remove coal by 2025 and the need to support 
even greater intermittent generation, set against 
a backdrop of affordability, the case for more 
biomass generating capacity is strong.
 We recently commissioned the economic 
consultancy NERA and Imperial College, London, 
to look at the whole system costs for a variety 
of renewable technologies. They found that 
biomass is £7–£35/MWh more affordable than 
other technologies and that if these new support 
levels were modelled in the government’s 
planned renewable energy auctions, consumers 
could save in the region of £2 billion.
“The case for more 
biomass generating 
capacity is strong.” 
“Our biomass generation 
is significantly better 
than coal – 80% cleaner 
in terms of carbon 
emissions.”
Dorothy Thompson CBE
Chief Executive

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Strategic report
Q. You are in the middle of a State Aid 
investigation and have previously sued 
the government. Is this type of external 
activity just business as usual for Drax?
A. It was clear from the very beginning of 
the CfD process that any positive decision 
would need to go through a State Aid process, 
as do many projects that receive state support. 
Whilst of course we would have liked a 
somewhat speedier decision than is currently 
the case, we firmly believe it is right and proper 
that the European Commission conduct a 
thorough and detailed investigation. Now that 
we are in the second phase of the process we 
look forward to working with them closely over 
the coming months.
The removal of the CCL exemption was a 
surprise to all within the energy sector. Many 
believe that the notice period provided by the 
government was inappropriate and it is for that 
reason we, and other renewable operators, 
asked the courts to examine the decision. 
Q. Given the significant political 
risk to which Drax is exposed, how 
can you be sure that any promised 
shareholder returns will be 
achieved over the short and 
medium term?
A. The fundamental question to ask is this: 
are we making a valuable contribution? If the 
answer is yes, which I am confident it is, and 
the business remains operationally strong, then 
shareholder value will accrue. Regrettably it is 
not within my gift to fully insulate the business 
from commodity price movements and abrupt 
changes to government policy, despite the good 
relations we have, and continuous engagement 
with officials in the UK, EU and USA. 
Q. A significant amount of revenue 
is predicated on the sustainable 
sourcing of your biomass. How do 
you ensure compliance with all 
relevant sustainability legislation?
A. The UK Renewables Obligation (RO) has 
a range of legislative requirements to ensure 
biomass used for electricity generation 
is low carbon and sustainable including 
requirements to ensure that bio-diversity, 
productivity and sensitive habitats are 
protected and maintained. Drax is audited 
annually by independent auditors to ensure 
that all these requirements are met. Every 
pellet plant is audited and should have Chain 
of Custody certification. They must also be 
able to prove that the wood fibre they supply 
us is legal, sustainable and low carbon and 
that the criteria within the RO are being met. 
With Ofgem benchmarking SBP as being 
fully compliant with the UK’s RO we and most 
of our suppliers, are transitioning our pellet 
production to sustainability certification 
under the SBP sustainability standards. 
Q. Is burning biomass really cleaner 
than coal? What about those 
reports that say otherwise?
A. Our biomass generation is significantly better 
for the climate than coal - independently verified 
to be more than 80% lower in terms of carbon 
emissions. It also generates much less nitrogen 
oxides and sulphur dioxide. Reports with adverse 
conclusions are usually predicated on false 
assumptions – for instance that our demand is 
contributing to deforestation or that we take 
from forests that are in decline, which is simply 
not the case.
Q. Shouldn’t wood be used for more 
valuable purposes?
A. The use of wood to replace fossil fuels 
for large scale electricity generation has a 
high economic, social and environmental value. 
A great many businesses and homes depend 
on the electricity generated from biomass in 
addition to revenue generated in the forest 
industry and supply chain. We source from 
regions with large working forests that can 
readily supply our needs whilst continuing 
to meet the demands of other wood-based 
industries. In fact by providing landowners 
with this additional source of revenue, we 
help them reinvest in their working forests 
to ensure this resource remains available for 
future generations. 
Q. Do your suppliers use whole 
trees? Is that a sensible thing 
to do?
A. Our suppliers often use thinnings – 
small trees – that have been removed from 
working forests to maximise the growth of the 
remaining trees, as well as lower-value wood 
from final harvesting operations. In all cases, 
we ensure that this wood is sustainably 
sourced from forests that are maintained or 
increasing in size, thereby ensuring that our 
sourcing practices do not adversely impact 
long term carbon stocks. 
Q. Why don’t you source biomass from 
the UK?
A. Drax does source a very small proportion 
of biomass from the UK, predominantly heating 
pellets, agricultural residues, miscanthus and 
straw. With regard to wood, in world terms 
the UK has a relatively small forested area not 
capable of meeting the country’s demand for 
wood products. As a consequence the UK is 
heavily reliant on imports for a range of 
wood products including sawn-wood, 
wood-based panels, and pulp and paper 
as well as wood pellets. 
Q. How can shipping wood half way 
round the world ever be described 
as sustainable?
A. Due to the compressed nature and high 
density of the pellets, and the large ships used, 
we consistently show carbon savings of more 
than 80% compared to coal including emissions 
from our supply chain. Global sea borne trade is a 
very efficient way of moving bulk commodities 
such as compressed wood pellets. Indeed, it is 
more carbon efficient for us to transport them 
from across the Atlantic by sea than it would be 
to truck them several hundred miles. The UK has 
been a net importer of energy and, as outlined 
earlier, wood products for many years and our 
trade in compressed wood pellets is no different. 
Q. Where will you find opportunities 
for growth in the medium term?
A. Drax is the world leader in biomass 
technology and I am excited by the 
opportunities this will present the Group in both 
the medium and longer term. It is encouraging 
that in the longer term, as the biomass market 
matures, it should become competitive without 
subsidy support provided there is a robust 
carbon price and an equitable allocation of 
whole system costs.
Q. With so many long serving Board 
directors having left the Group in 2015 
this could be described as the end of 
an era. What impact do you think it 
will have?
A. We have been fortunate to have such 
a stable and dedicated Board for such a 
long period of time. However, with the recent 
additions, we have brought fresh perspectives 
and skills which complement those we already 
have. Your Board is in good shape and focused 
on leading Drax through the next phase of 
its development.

Our three businesses
Drax has three 
principal activities:
– sourcing fuel
– generating electricity 
–  supplying power 
and wood pellets 
to customers
We source wood fibre from the 
US South and compressed wood 
pellets from suppliers around the 
world. Drax Biomass is a major 
manufacturer of wood pellets.
We have dedicated port facilities on the 
Humber, Tyne and Mersey estuaries, allowing 
both compressed wood pellets and coal to be 
imported from around the world.
Locations
Drax Biomass is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia with 
operations in two US States: Mississippi and Louisiana. 
This places it at the heart of the US’s largest working 
forest sector.
During 2015 we completed construction of two new 
pellet manufacturing plants facilities: at Amite BioEnergy in 
Gloster, Mississippi and Morehouse BioEnergy near Bastrop, 
Louisiana. We also completed on our port facility in Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana.
source
The principal activities define the structure of 
our business
We organise the business to align with the principal activities, 
operating through four business units.
Source
Drax Biomass is a supplier of compressed wood pellets 
manufactured from sustainable sources which are then used 
in the upgraded biomass boilers in our power station. We also 
secure additional biomass supplies through long term contracts 
with third parties. We source our coal in the international and 
domestic markets.
Generate
Drax Power generates electricity which is then sold in the 
wholesale and retail power markets.
Supply
Supply activities are delivered through three routes: Drax Power 
sells power to large customers in the wholesale markets; Haven 
Power supplies electricity to businesses; our newly acquired 
operating unit, Billington Bioenergy, supplies compressed wood 
pellets to commercial and domestic customers for heating.
The risks associated with each activity are managed within the 
business units, consolidated into the principal risks faced by the 
Group – and regularly reviewed by the Board.

1  Source (b&c)
Biomass fibre is sourced from working forests 
where there is a surplus of available material. 
Coal is purchased from global suppliers. We 
also use non‑standard forms of coal, usually 
reclaimed as part of environmental clean up.
How we add value
Long‑term biomass supply contracts provide 
certainty, whilst spot market activity secures 
competitive prices.
Use of non‑standard sources of coal (for 
example pond fines) reduce total fuel costs.
2 Process (b)
We have our own pellet manufacturing 
facilities in the southern United States.
How we add value
By developing our own facilities we increase 
security around biomass fuel supplies.
3 Logistics (b&c)
Biomass and coal is transported in large 
volumes using sea and rail routes. 
How we add value
Fuel is transported over long distances 
using specialist carriers through the most 
efficient routes.
Use of road transport is minimised, reducing 
the carbon emissions from transportation.
Dedicated storage facilities have been built 
and are operational at three UK ports and in 
the US at Baton Rouge, providing resilience 
in our biomass supply chain.
Dedicated rail facilities move coal and biomass 
from ports to the power station.
Long‑term contracts secure prices and can be 
hedged to minimise financial risks. 
4 Storage
Compressed wood pellets are stored in climate 
controlled domes before delivery to the 
generation facilities. 
How we add value
On site storage allows for the efficient delivery 
of fuel to the operating units on demand.
Each of our four domes can hold 75,000 
tonnes of pellets.
On site coal stocks are blended to minimise 
environmental emissions, in particular oxides 
of nitrogen and sulphur.
5 Power generation
We have six generating units, each with an 
output capacity of 645MW.
How we add value
Conversion to biomass has secured revenue 
streams and reduced carbon emissions, in turn 
reducing carbon costs.
Operational efficiency is a top priority. 
Appropriate investment and continuous 
process improvement maximise 
electricity output.
By‑products from the generation process 
are reused, or sold. Sales of these to industry 
has reduced landfill levels.
6 Trading
Trading takes place in the wholesale markets.
How we add value
Trading teams at Drax Power sell electricity, 
in medium and short‑term markets.
Short‑term balancing markets present flexible 
trading opportunities.
Sales are hedged by buying forward in 
the liquid market to minimise price and 
volume risks.
Each generating unit is kept under constant 
review, only dispatching to the market where 
demand and pricing create value.
Risks are reduced through well developed 
commodity, collateral and currency 
trading policies.
7 Sales

Our marketplace
Unexpectedly severe declines in the 
global commodity markets made 2015 
a challenging year.
2015 and current market conditions
Our markets were characterised by falling 
prices and spreads. The combination of a 
slowdown of growth in the Chinese economy 
and OPEC’s shift to focus on market share 
in the oil market has meant that energy 
commodity prices have fallen significantly.
UK power market prices are to a large degree 
determined by gas prices which have fallen 
more than our wood pellet, coal and carbon 
prices. Our margins have thereby been reduced. 
The spread between our input fuel and 
operating costs and our power revenue has 
narrowed as a result. In 2015 our production 
was hedged to off-set a large part of the falls 
in margins and a significant part of 2016 
production was also locked in at a time with 
higher spreads.
Future market drivers
In the near future we will see an increasing 
impact from the fall in spreads. We expect the 
depressed commodity markets to continue 
into 2016.
Commodity market recovery could happen 
as a result of a number of different scenarios: 
a rebound in growth in the world economy; a 
supply side reaction to lower prices; or, simply 
from a cut back of oil and gas production in 
OPEC and Russia. Drax does not take a position 
on when the markets will recover, but 
endeavours to protect earnings when the 
markets are low and to be prepared to take 
advantage of an increase in commodity prices 
when it happens.
UK power demand at peak times is getting 
close to the total available production capacity. 
We expect the supply margin to tighten further 
with recent announcements regarding the 
closure of five coal-fired power stations in 2016, 
which together have a generating capacity 
of 8GW. 
The unusually warm and windy 2015/16 winter 
means that electricity prices have not reflected 
the tightness of the market, but if temperatures 
in the coming winter return to historic norms 
there is good chance that the lower available 
capacity will result in improved prices 
and spreads. 
“Our markets in 2015 
were characterised by 
falling prices and 
spreads.”
“As more coal plants 
close there is a greater 
chance of tighter 
markets.”

System integration cost of renewables
£/MWh
No additional flex
Medium flex
Drax also expects to increase the amount 
of ancillary services it is able to provide in 
supporting the national grid. Last year, the 
system operator spent £800 million on 
maintaining a reliable system through the 
procurement of balancing, frequency response, 
reactive power and black start services. The 
demand for system services is likely to increase 
as the level of intermittent generation on 
the system increases. In addition to being a 
growing market opportunity it is also one where 
the number of players capable of serving it is 
reducing as more conventional power stations 
close. It is a market in which we expect to play 
an increasingly critical and valuable role. 
Further biomass opportunities
With two units converted to biomass and 
a third unit ready for conversion when the 
investment contract receives State Aid 
approval, Drax has already taken a large step 
towards being part of the low carbon energy 
system of the future. The Paris 2015 agreement 
on climate change points toward a continued 
focus on measures to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and Drax plans to play an important 
part in achieving the targets set out. 
The UK government has signalled a shift 
towards higher focus on security of supply 
and affordability in energy policy. Drax is well 
placed to provide the solutions required – 
through production of renewable heating fuel, 
further conversion from coal to compressed 
wood pellets or through increased flexibility 
in the running of our remaining coal units.
We believe there is a good case for further 
upgrades of our remaining coal units using 
our advanced biomass technology. The system 
needs plants that can provide energy when the 
wind is not blowing and the sun doesn’t shine, 
as well as plants that can provide the ancillary 
services outlined above. 
If the costs of providing backup and 
system services are taken into account, i.e. 
the comparison is based on whole system 
costs, then we believe that coal plants 
converted to wood pellets would reduce 
the cost of decarbonisation considerably. 
A recent study by the economic consultancy 
NERA, in partnership with Imperial College, 
London, concluded that on a like for like 
generation basis, coal to biomass upgrades 
would result in system integration costs 
£11–25MWh lower than solar or wind. These 
costs are lower because of the flexible output 
of biomass generating units and their ability to 
provide ancillary services to the national grid.
Incremental upgrades of coal generating plant 
to biomass will support the continued expansion 
of solar and wind at a lower cost to the taxpayer 
as it will require less buildout of new backup 
capacity that would largely stand idle.
Drax has optimised its world leading 
biomass technology and with the right support 
stands ready to initiate further generating 
unit upgrades.
“The demand for system 
services is likely to increase 
as the level of intermittent 
generation on the system 
increases. We expect to play 
an increasingly critical role.”

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s review
For any business operating 
in the UK energy market, 
2015 was a difficult year.
For Drax it was especially so. Yet operationally, 
it was a year of strong progress: we moved a 
step closer to the completion of our biomass 
transformation, upgrading our third unit to 
enhanced co-firing and the power station to 
a predominantly biomass fuelled generator; 
we began manufacturing and supplying 
compressed wood pellets from our mills in 
the USA; and Haven completed another 
year of record sales. The scale of these 
achievements cannot be underestimated, 
even more so when one recalls that at 
the start of our biomass journey we had 
neither a generation nor supply solution. 
Sat alongside this strong operational 
achievement were some of the toughest 
commodity markets I have known in my career. 
These were then accompanied by a series 
of unexpected regulatory announcements, 
including the removal of the CCL exemption, 
which severely affected the renewables 
sector and caused many to question the UK 
government’s commitment to decarbonisation.
In November the Secretary of State for 
Energy and Climate Change announced the 
government’s proposal to consult on setting a 
clear end date for coal of March 2025. Given it still 
provides around 25% of the country’s generating 
capacity, this is an ambitious target which could 
deliver significant carbon savings and secure 
electricity if carefully implemented. We stand 
ready to assist with this. Coal is high carbon and 
we need to urgently reduce our dependency 
on it. Part of the solution is new nuclear and 
gas. But, as a recent report by the Institute of 
Mechanical Engineers noted, the country will 
find it very difficult to build enough new facilities 
in time to replace the lost coal capacity. 
The fastest, most affordable and safest 
way to end coal use is to further deploy the 
world leading low carbon technology Drax 
has pioneered to upgrade some of the UK’s 
existing coal fired power stations to biomass. 
Our strategic priorities are aligned with this 
and, with the right support framework we 
stand ready to help make this happen.

Affordability
The current administration has been clear – 
when it comes to new renewable generating 
capacity, affordability is a critical criterion. 
Recent work by the economic consultancy 
NERA and Imperial College has found that on 
a whole system cost basis biomass is £7–£35/
MWh more affordable than other technologies. 
If these support levels were then modelled in 
the government’s planned renewable energy 
auctions for later this year, consumers could 
save in the region of £2 billion. At the same time 
it could take four years for a new build gas facility 
to come online, even if it can be shown that 
it could achieve an acceptable return on 
investment. It is because of these factors that 
we believe there to be a very strong case for 
further coal to biomass upgrades at Drax and we 
will continue to work closely with government to 
help the country achieve its goals.
Sustainability
It is important to note that Drax is on the journey 
from coal to sustainable biomass quickly and 
safely reducing the UK’s carbon emissions whilst 
still generating reliable and affordable electricity.
Our biomass technology achieves a carbon 
saving of up to 80% vs coal – a figure 
independently audited by PwC and verified 
by our industry regulator, Ofgem. We are 
Europe’s single largest decarbonisation 
project and if we were able to upgrade 100% 
of our power station to sustainable biomass, 
we would make an even larger contribution 
towards the decarbonisation of the UK. 
On both a personal and professional level I was 
pleased with the continued progress being 
made by the SBP. In March it launched its 
framework which would allow companies in 
the biomass sector to demonstrate compliance 
with legal, regulatory and sustainability 
requirements relating to woody biomass. In 
December this framework was recognised 
by Ofgem as being fully compliant with the 
UK’s RO legislation. This firmly established 
SBP as an effective certification scheme for 
biomass users to demonstrate compliance 
with regulatory requirements. It also adds 
to recognition in Denmark through the 
Danish Energy Agreement, and is undergoing 
evaluation in Belgium and The Netherlands.
Safety
Excellent safety management has always 
been at the centre of our management ethos 
and I am pleased to say that in the UK our 
performance remains industry-leading. In 
the US, we exceeded our safety targets for 
2015 and have made great strides towards 
instilling a culture of safety through the 
implementation of various proactive safety 
protocols across our facilities. As has always 
been the case, the safety and well being 
of our employees and contractors will 
remain my primary operational priority.
“Our ability to respond in an ever 
more flexible way will help us 
better support the grid.”
Strategic priorities
1
Critical infrastructure 
Continue our transformation from coal to biomass generation. 
2
World leading biomass 
technology
Continue to develop our expertise and technology in the sourcing, manufacture, 
transportation and combustion of compressed wood pellets.

Commodities
As I have already stated, commodity markets 
have been challenging, driving the price of 
power to some of the lowest levels in the last 15 
years. Unlike in previous cycles this fall was not 
offset by the drop in the price of coal, with dark 
green spreads being very weak. Our teams were 
incredibly proactive in limiting our exposure to 
volatility in the commodities markets and were 
able to limit the negative impact on earnings.
The year in question was one of the windiest in 
the last 20 years, which, when combined with 
increased wind generating capacity, led to an 
oversupply of ROCs. This will continue into 
2016 but we are pleased to note that the UK 
government has taken action to address this for 
future years. 
Regulation
Energy is a complex industry; the challenge 
of addressing climate change even more 
so. Both require effective policies that 
help meet the world’s energy needs while 
significantly reducing carbon emissions. The 
need to tackle security of supply also requires 
effective policies to encourage long term 
investment in a diverse range of technologies. 
And above all, industry needs stability and 
surety so that it can secure shareholder 
support for long term investment decisions.
This has been a difficult transitional year for 
the renewable industry. As one of the UK’s 
largest generators of renewable energy 
we have been impacted more than most, 
but it is important to stress that the UK 
government remains committed to, and 
supportive of, the current role of biomass. 
Strong operational performance from 
our business units
Each business unit has performed strongly 
during the year, as described below.
Drax Power
Excellent availability and reliability throughout 
the year meant that once again our power 
station was able to prove its worth, providing 
flexible generation output and balancing 
services in support of system stability and 
security. As the amount of intermittency 
steadily increases we expect these services 
to become ever more valuable to the grid.
It was a record year for planned outages, 
with four taking place, including the 
successful completion of our first major 
overhaul of an upgraded biomass unit. 
For the first time since the beginning of the last 
decade our coal units have started to two-shift, 
by which we mean they do not run in a continual, 
base load manner. We recognise that this is the 
future for these units, and our ability to respond 
in an ever more flexible way will help us better 
support the grid and, in being able to play a more 
active role in the prompt market, create 
incremental shareholder value.
Our use of non-standard sources of coal 
increased significantly over the year to 503Kt 
(2014: 257Kt). An example is the use of coal 
residues recovered from former coal mines 
as clean up operations take place. As well as 
providing a useful outlet for these residues and 
ensuring they do not end up in landfill, they are 
exempt from carbon tax. We expect to continue 
use of these fuel types in 2016. 
Haven
Haven achieved a record 13.8TWh of sales (2014: 
11.8TWh). Our customer proposition remains 
compelling as does our ability to deliver a service 
that consistently exceeds expectations. This 
means that we have very strong renewal rates. 
Over the period we were delighted to welcome 
Thames Water as a new customer (further 
demonstrating our strength in the utilities 
market), as well as many others.
The link between record sales and strong 
customer retention is people – at its core Haven 
is a people business. Our customers have named 
account managers; they deal with real people 
who take their business seriously. Our service is 
second to none.
In previous years I made it very clear that scale 
and therefore growth was our primary objective 
for Haven. This growth has delivered cash into 
the Group. In future years we will shift our focus 
to creating new sources of value.
The removal of the CCL exemption had a 
significant negative impact on the business, yet 
Haven was the first in the market to respond

Drax Biomass
This year was a milestone for Drax Biomass, 
as our port facility became operational in 
April, followed closely by our manufacturing 
facilities in June and July. I am pleased with 
the performance of our new US business 
and I am encouraged by the potential 
for new business opportunities in the 
US, spurred on by the implementation 
of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan 
amongst other external developments.
Outlook
This was a tough year for Drax and 2016 will be 
equally challenging. Your senior management 
team took decisive action to ameliorate the 
impacts of events outside of our direct control 
and will continue to do so. 
We have developed and have already begun 
to implement a robust plan to identify and 
create incremental shareholder value. Core 
to this will be moving our power station 
from not only being a reliable and consistent 
generator to one that, in a new age of low 
commodity prices, is also dynamic and agile. 
The plan addresses three specific areas: a 
laser sharp focus on cost control including 
capital expenditure; revenue optimisation 
(especially in changing the way we manage 
our coal units to provide system support 
to the grid) and downstream development 
of the retail renewable power market. At 
the same time we continue to evaluate a 
range of longer-term strategic options.
Drax is a world leader in biomass technology 
– not just in our ability to upgrade existing 
plant, but also in how to source, process and 
improve its use as a fuel. We will continue to 
search for opportunities to create value from 
this expertise in the UK, US and elsewhere. 
In the UK this means we will continue to 
play a critical role in the transition away 
from coal and in further decarbonisation. 
More biomass conversions are the means 
by which this can be achieved quickly, safely 
and most importantly of all, at the fairest 
price to the tax/bill payer. We will continue 
to work closely with government to make 
the case for further unit conversions.

Sustainability biomass review
Sustainable biomass is 
fundamental to our success. 
Drax’s sustainability governance
It is fundamental to Drax that the biomass we 
consume is sustainable and legal. We have a 
dedicated sustainability team whose role is to 
ensure the biomass meets the requirements 
we have set ourselves in our Sustainability 
Policy and the criteria for sustainable biomass 
as established by the UK government. 
Drax’s sustainability policy
As the sustainability of the biomass we use is a fundamental part of our business we make every 
effort to ensure that all our supplies comply with the following principles: 
The sustainability team reports to the 
Director of Group Sustainability who has overall 
responsibility for delivering Drax’s sustainability 
performance and ensuring that the biomass 
consumed to generate electricity meets the 
government’s sustainability criteria. In doing 
so ROCs can be claimed on the electricity 
generated from compressed wood pellets in 
place of coal.
 100%
All our biomass sourcing is fully 
compliant with our regulator 
Ofgem’s requirements
Our sustainability policy

UK government’s sustainability 
legislation criteria 
In order to be able to claim ROCs for the 
electricity we generate from the biomass that 
we consume it is necessary that it meets the UK 
government’s sustainability and Greenhouse 
Gas emissions savings criteria. The sustainability 
criteria can be summarised as follows: 
– 
Management of the forest must ensure:
• productivity of the forest is maintained
• ecosystem health and vitality is 
maintained
• biodiversity is maintained 
• harm to ecosystems is minimised
– 
The forest management organisation and 
any contractors must comply with local and 
national legal requirements relevant to 
labour and welfare, and health and safety. 
 –
Management of the forest must have full 
regard to identification, documentation and 
respect of legal, customary and traditional 
tenure and use rights related to the forest; 
mechanisms for resolving grievances and 
disputes including those relating to tenure 
and use rights, to forest (or land) 
management practices and to work 
conditions; and safeguarding the basic labour 
rights and health and safety of forest workers.
What do we do to ensure biomass is 
sustainable?
We have a responsibility (environmental, social 
and economic) to ensure we constantly drive 
improvements along our supply chain, from 
forestry practices in the locations where the raw 
materials for the wood pellets are sourced to the 
point where they enter our boilers. A critical part 
of this is building close relationships with our 
suppliers so that we can openly discuss issues 
with them and support efforts to improve their 
working practices. 
The biomass journey
Before we receive any wood pellets from a 
supplier our contract with them requires them 
to provide information through a sustainability 
declaration on the source of their materials, on 
the forest management practices in their region, 
and on the greenhouse gas characteristics of 
their pellet plant and supply chain.
This is followed by an independent third 
party audit of the supplier on the ground 
using the information in the declaration and 
regional analyses, checking these against 
our Sustainability Policy and UK regulatory 
criteria. These audits are held on a regular basis 
(normally a three year cycle, more frequently 
when considered necessary) and require 
the independent auditor to understand and 
examine the forest management practices 
in the supply base of each supplier. 
Only once we are satisfied that supplies of 
wood pellets meet the necessary policy and 
regulatory requirements can the supplier be 
approved. Once a supplier has been approved 
they are obliged to update their sustainability 
declaration annually with current information 
and data, which then goes through a review 
and approval process.
One way to demonstrate the sustainability 
of our wood pellets is for them to come 
with a Forest Stewardship Council® 
(FSC®), FSC® - C119787 - or Programme for the 
Endorsement of Forest CertificationTM (PEFC) 
Forest Management or Chain of Custody 
certificate. These certificates provide evidence 
that sustainable forestry working practices 
are in place where the feedstocks originate 
and/or that the quality of the management 
systems of the suppliers concerned have 
been assessed by independent third parties. 
Supplier audits
Each potential new pellet supplier is fully 
audited before any commercial agreement is 
put in place. Existing suppliers are audited at 
least once every three years. Every audit makes 
107 detailed checks on the entire supply chain 
and manufacturing process of the pellet mill. 
Findings are subdivided into three categories 
of priority; high, medium and low. High priority 
issues mean that existing supply is ceased 
immediately. For issues of medium priority the 
supplier is given time to rectify the issue. Low 
priority issues are those our third party auditors 
believe are opportunities for improvements.
 
In 2015 we audited ten new pellet mills and two 
existing suppliers. We found no high priority 
issues, forty three improvement opportunities, 
and six medium priority issues. Five of these 
medium priority issues are in the process of 
being rectified, while the other resulted in us 
not contracting for supply with the pellet mill.
“As the sustainability of the biomass is a fundamental part of 
our business we ensure that all sourcing complies with our 
sustainability policy.”

The only wood sourced from the UK in 2015 
was just over 10,000 tonnes of short rotation 
willow coppice. As the forest area in the UK 
is small compared to other countries, it is 
heavily reliant on imports for a range of wood 
products including sawn wood, wood-based 
panels, pulp and paper and wood pellets. 
Drax does source a very small proportion of 
biomass from local suppliers, predominantly 
agricultural residues, miscanthus and straw.
To meet our demand for wood pellets we 
need to source from overseas regions with 
large working forests that produce wood in 
excess of the demands from other wood-
based industries. However, these forestry 
activities need to be performed in such a way 
that they can be considered sustainable.
In 2015 we sourced more wood pellets than 
in previous years from the US South. This is a 
major region for timber production and there 
are large volumes of low value by-products 
which can be used to make compressed wood 
pellets, and the infrastructure is already in place 
to support a diverse wood based industry. 
The US South is a very heavily forested region. 
As the table below illustrates, the total area of 
timberland (productive forest) is over 83 million 
hectares (ha), representing 61% of the total area. 
There is a substantial quantity of standing 
volume (growing stock), in excess of five 
billion tonnes. More importantly there is also a 
significant annual surplus with 218 million 
tonnes of annual growth set alongside only 
132 million tonnes harvested.

Sustainability biomass review continued
The surplus of growth over removals is well 
established. This has been influenced by a 
number of factors including improvements to 
how forests are managed.
One issue that is raised by stakeholders is that 
the biomass market has a distorting effect on 
traditional wood product markets. However, 
we believe that biomass markets complement, 
rather than compete with, traditional wood 
product markets. In the US South many pellet 
mills have located in areas where traditional 
wood product markets have reduced and 
consolidated due to global competition and 
decreasing demand for consumer products such 
as paper. It is advantageous for the wood pellet 
industry to build pellet mills in regions with a 
substantial surplus of fibre so as to avoid 
competition with higher-paying wood 
product industries.
What changed in 2015?
In December 2015 the latest version of 
the UK government’s RO was released. It 
requires that from 1 December 2015 ROCs are 
only issued when feedstocks can demonstrate 
compliance with the UK government’s 
mandatory sustainability criteria. We have 
already gone through two compliance years 
(1 April to 31 March) where our reported data has 
been assured to ISAE 3000(1) standards with no 
issues highlighted, which demonstrates our 
ability to meet the now mandatory compliance 
requirements. More information on the RO can 
be found on the Ofgem website. 
Sustainable Biomass Partnership 
This industry-led initiative formed in 2013, 
provides assurance that woody biomass is 
sourced from legal and sustainable sources. 
We co-founded the SBP in 2013 with six other 
companies. Our Group Chief Executive, Dorothy 
Thompson, chairs the SBP Board.
The reason for implementing this scheme is 
that while the FSC and PEFC standards cover 
the sustainability of forest products, greenhouse 
gas (GHG) reporting is not covered in their 
scopes and uptake of them is low in some areas 
of the world. SBP aligns closely with FSC and 
PEFC, and there is an ongoing dialogue with 
both schemes as to how they could extend the 
scope of their requirements. 
In 2015 Ofgem benchmarked SBP against the 
UK government’s sustainability requirements 
for woody biomass and found it meets all 
the criteria.

An Advisory Board was established in 2015 to 
ensure that stakeholders have the opportunity 
to influence and participate in the development 
of the standard. SBP has set the following 
objectives to the end of 2016:
– 
To provide an effective mechanism that 
enables producers and users of solid 
biomass for energy production to 
demonstrate compliance with European/
national regulatory, including sustainability, 
requirements.
– 
To promote enhanced sustainable forest 
management and greater uptake of existing 
efficient and internationally recognised, 
third party verified forest certification 
schemes in key forest source areas or 
wood baskets.
– 
To contribute to a strengthened scientific 
evidence base and a greater understanding 
of the issues associated with the use of solid 
biomass for energy production.
– 
To increase supply chain transparency 
by collecting and disseminating 
performance data.
We are pleased to see that the industry is 
taking up the challenge that SBP makes to 
demonstrating high standards in the wood pellet 
industry and three suppliers have to date gained 
certification, with many others in the process of 
gaining certification.
Greenhouse gas savings
To meet the GHG emissions savings criteria as 
set by the UK government, we measure and 
monitor our carbon emissions to assess our 
own performance and that of our suppliers. 
We are obliged to use the DECC solid biomass 
and biogas carbon calculator to calculate the life 
cycle GHG emissions for all biomass consumed. 
GHG calculations are carried out for all material 
consumed by us and we report this data monthly 
to Ofgem. This data is also a key part of the third 
party audit for ROCs that we are required to have 
carried out annually on the information we 
report to Ofgem.

below Ofgem’s current threshold of 79gCO2/MJ, 
but we continue to monitor our lifecycle 
emissions and compare these against the 2020 
threshold of 55gCO2/MJ in order to identify 
opportunities to improve our supply chains. 
In 2016 we have set ourselves the target to 
work with the ten suppliers that have the 
highest lifecycle emissions to help them 
understand how changes in their processes 
could help them meet the 2020 threshold.

INVESTING IN LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES
When International Paper closed its 
Louisiana Mill in 2009 after nearly a  
century of operations the shut-down hit  
the county of Morehouse, Louisiana hard. 
Unemployment jumped to 17% as more than 
500 employees lost jobs. For Morehouse, 
with a population of around 12,000 it was 
the second mill closing in 26 years.
 
International Paper attributed the closure, 
announced in 2008, to “the continuing 
decline in pulp demand from customers 
worldwide coupled with a weak economy 
across the globe.”
 
Since the late 1990s, economic 
conditions have led to numerous paper 
mill closings in communities throughout 
the Southeastern U.S.
 
According to a study by researchers at the 
U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) and Auburn 
University, “between 2000 and 2011… the 
southern region lost 17 pulp mills, a 6% drop 
in regional capacity.” The pulp, paper, and 
paperboard industry lost 32,000 jobs, or 
approximately 14% of its workforce, between 
early 1997 and 2002. In addition a report 
from American Forest & Paper Association 
showed that 95 paper mills closed in America 
in the decade from 1991 to 2001.
The rise of the pellet mill
Drax and other pellet manufacturers  
are helping to reverse this decline by 
constructing new pellet plants in 
communities that have been impacted by 
industry consolidation yet maintain large 
areas of working forests.
 
A 2012 study by researchers at the 
University of Tennessee and USDA 
predicted “a number of bioenergy plants 
have been established or announced in  
the US South which could increase 
employment and economic activity 
considerably, at least in some locations.”
 
With 2.4 million hectares of timberland 
found within a 50 mile radius of Morehouse, 
it is perhaps not surprising that Drax chose 
it as the location for one of its two pellet 
mills. We now employ around 50 full-time

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Performance review
2015 was an important year for 
Drax Biomass. We successfully 
commissioned our port facility 
and received, stored, loaded 
and shipped 243Kt of pellets.
Drax Biomass Inc., our pellet manufacturing 
and supply business, owns and operates two 
pellet mills and a port facility in the US South. 
The business manufactures high quality wood 
pellets from sustainably sourced feedstock for 
use as a low carbon, renewable fuel in power 
generation. Drax Biomass currently sells all of 
its output to Drax Power and is a key part of the 
Group’s strategy to secure a robust and reliable 
supply chain of sustainable biomass for 
renewable generation.
Pete Madden 
Chief Executive, Drax Biomass
Market
The US South offers a highly favourable 
business climate for Drax Biomass. The 
region has a long history of practising 
sustainable forestry for a variety of economic, 
environmental and recreational purposes, and 
the forest products industry remains one of 
the largest and most important contributors 
to the state economies. As such, the biomass 
industry enjoys strong support among local 
elected officials and their constituents. Drax 
Biomass also benefits from the region’s ideal 
growing conditions and vast stands of working 
forests, which help to ensure that the business 
has access to ample supplies of low cost, 
sustainably sourced fibre. Infrastructure is 
another key differentiator for the US South, as 
the region boasts a network of well-maintained 
roads for delivery of raw fibre to our facilities, 
extensive rail networks to efficiently transport 
our pellets, and deep-water ports that can 
handle the world’s largest shipping vessels.
Drax Biomass and the wood pellet industry are 
impacted by a wide range of market dynamics 
that shape fibre demand in the regions in which 
we operate. This demand is driven primarily by 
underlying demand for construction materials, 
paper-based consumer products and other 
wood-based products. These markets, in turn, 
are shaped by general economic conditions, 
demographic changes, residential construction 
activity, maintenance and other activities that 
impact plant-level production, as well as by 
competition from foreign suppliers.

Changes in these market conditions can cause 
fluctuations in both the price and availability of 
feedstocks for the wood pellet industry.
Weather is another important variable that 
impacts the wood pellet industry and the 
broader forest products sector. Wet conditions 
can limit accessibility to harvesting sites and 
adversely impact the operability of heavy 
equipment within those sites. During extended 
periods of wet weather, pellet manufacturers 
and other wood-based industries may 
experience localised price spikes due to 
temporary disruptions in fibre supply.
Operational review
2015 was an important year for Drax Biomass. 
We successfully commissioned our port facility 
in April, and by year-end we had successfully 
manufactured, transported, received, stored, 
loaded and shipped 243Kt of wood pellets.
We also successfully commissioned our Amite 
and Morehouse BioEnergy facilities in August. 
Although we have made strong progress toward 
producing pellets of consistently high quality, 
our production levels were impacted by 
weather-related construction delays during the 
first half of the year. Poor weather continued to 
be a factor during the second half of the year, 
but our plant operators are growing more adept 
at maintaining stable and reliable operations 
under adverse weather conditions. The ramp up 
towards full capacity will continue during 2016.
Financial results
The financial results of the business are driven 
by the volume of pellets produced and shipped 
to Drax Power Station. The first shipment was 
successfully dispatched in April 2015.
Sales of pellets in the year ending 31 December 
2015 totalled $43.3 million reflecting the volume 
of pellets sold intra-group to Drax Power on 
under an arms-length commercial agreement.
Raw fibre costs make up the majority of our 
costs of sale. Such costs have been higher than 
we expected as we progressed through the 
start-up and commissioning phase earlier in the 
year but, as forecasted, have begun to fall as 
the optimisation of operations progressed 
during the second half of the year. 
Operating costs have increased year on year, 
reflecting the commencement of commercial 
operations across both of our sites. Despite the 
challenges we have faced during the year we 
have successfully managed to control our costs 
and as a result total spend was lower than 
originally anticipated.
Looking ahead
Our objective is to become a high quality 
supplier of compressed wood pellets. We will 
continue to seek process efficiencies as well as 
work on enhancing pellet durability and quality. 
Certification from the SBP is also a critical 
objective for the team.
Recent developments in US energy policy, 
not least the publication of President Obama’s 
Clean Power Plan, will, we hope, create 
opportunities for us to create further value 
within our operations. 
Lastly, the year ahead will be defined by a 
continued focus on safety across all operations, 
as well as further civic and charitable 
engagement in our local communities.
Risk
The principal risks of the business are considered to be:
Risk
Mitigating activities
Weather-related damage to facilities
We carry business interruption insurance to 
protect against significant losses
Fire/explosion hazard from combustible pellet 
dust
We employ advanced fire detection and 
suppression systems at both manufacturing 
sites and port facility
Disruption in fibre supply from increased 
competition
We enter into long-term contracts with 
our suppliers where possible, and we are 
implementing a portfolio-based approach to 
our fibre procurement strategy
Regulatory and political change
We actively engage with regulators and 
legislators at the state and federal levels to 
influence policy that impacts our markets

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Performance review
We have delivered a strong 
operational performance but 
weak commodity markets and an 
uncertain regulatory framework 
remain a drag on our business.
Market context 
Drax Power Station is the largest power 
station in the UK (almost twice the size of 
the next largest power station) and typically 
meets some 8% of the UK’s electricity needs.
The key factors influencing our business 
are the regulatory framework, commodity 
markets, network generating capacity, 
and our operational performance.
Regulatory framework
As in previous years, the regulatory framework 
has had a material impact on our business. 
Key developments during 2015 included the 
removal of the CCL exemption for renewable 
electricity generated after 1 August 2015, 
announced by the government on 8 July.
The impact of this change was a reduction 
in EBITDA in the region of £30 million in 2015 
and £60 million in 2016. In later years the 
impact reduces, as the value of the exemption 
had been forecast to be negligible by the 
early 2020s.
Andy Koss
Chief Executive, Drax Power
The CfD investment contract for our third unit 
conversion was signed in April 2014, but is still 
subject to EU State Aid clearance. 
Trials have continued during 2015 to develop 
solutions for compliance with new emission 
limits which came into effect on 1 January 2016 
under the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED).
Commodity markets and generating capacity
Our profitability is primarily influenced by the 
bark spread (the difference between the power 
price and the cost of biomass net of renewable 
support) and the dark green spread (the 
difference between the power price and the 
cost of coal and carbon, including CO2 
allowances under the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme and the UK Carbon Price Support 
(CPS) mechanism).
Bark and dark green spreads are driven 
by a number of factors, such as underlying 
commodity prices (e.g. oil, gas, power, biomass 
including exchange rates, coal and carbon), 
the availability of generating capacity on the 
electricity system, and the physical positions 
taken by individual market participants.
In addition, we also provide valuable support 
services to National Grid across both our 
biomass and coal units to help maintain system 
operability and security of supply, for which we 
receive income. 
The growth of wind and solar (both near zero 
marginal cost generation) has created more 
volatile power prices which, in addition to NOx 
constraints, will likely lead to reduced load 
factors for our coal units.

Operational review 
For those factors under our control, we have 
delivered a strong performance during 2015.
With the modification of one of our generating 
units in July 2015 to run predominantly on 
biomass, we are close to completing our plan to 
convert three of our six units to burn sustainable 
biomass in place of coal.
It was an unprecedented year for planned 
outages, with maintenance taking place on four 
of our six units. This included the successful 
completion of our first major outage on a 
biomass unit. 
We successfully implemented flexible 
operations on our coal units during the year as 
a response to challenging market economics. 
Good availability was achieved across the 
power station, and excellent materials handling 
performance allowed the processing of more 
than 500Kt of non-standard sources of coal.
The capital investment in our UK biomass 
transformation is now largely complete and our 
IED investment programme is well advanced.
Financial results 
In a year during which trading and regulatory 
conditions have been challenging, our results 
are broadly equivalent to our internal target 
which is an excellent performance, given the 
impact of the removal of the CCL exemption 
and the challenging market conditions that 
developed during 2015. The impact of these 
negative factors was mitigated by strong 
station availability, biomass purchasing 
performance and more active management 
of prompt market trading.
Gross profit for 2015 was £390 million compared 
to £433 million in 2014. This reduction includes 
the impact of lower power prices, and the 
removal of the CCL exemption. This was 
mitigated by running another unit 
predominantly on biomass.
Looking ahead
Our objective remains to run a reliable, flexible 
and profitable power station. 
An important part of this is running the plant in 
a way that optimises value across the biomass 
and coal units; focusing on operating and 
capital expenditure decisions that allow us to 
maintain a reliable and flexible operation. 2016 
will be underpinned by a relentless push on the 
consistent application and penetration of a five 
star safety system.
Two major outages are scheduled for 2016 
(one biomass and one coal unit) together with 
extensive works to improve NOx performance 
and to allow further unit optimisation.
The year ahead will also be the first full 
year of burning biomass on three units, 
which will require smooth, integrated 
operations across the entire supply 
chain and procurement process.

Performance review
We have continued to deliver 
strong growth across the retail 
market in a challenging 
environment.
Haven Power (Haven) is a supplier of electricity 
to UK businesses, supplying electricity to both 
the Industrial and Commercial (I&C) and Small 
and Medium Enterprises (SME) markets.
Haven provides value for the Drax Group 
through the provision of an alternative 
credit efficient route to market for the power, 
ROCs and Renewable Energy Guarantees of 
Origin (REGOs) earned when Drax generates 
renewable power.
Billington Bioenergy (Billington) is the UK’s 
second largest supplier of ENplusA1 biomass 
wood pellets to commercial and domestic 
customers for heat. The acquisition of Billington 
reflects the significant potential the Group sees 
for biomass within the UK market for heating 
purposes given the government’s policy 
objective to decarbonise heat in the UK.
Market
The business sector of the electricity supply 
market has continued to be very competitive 
with our established competitors being joined by 
a number of new entrants. We have achieved 
growth by offering innovative and tailored 
contracts at competitive prices. By improving 
our service and providing the products and 
services UK business needs, we broaden and 
deepen existing relationships and increase the 
value that Haven provides to the Group.
The renewable heating market is very much in 
its infancy and has benefited from government 
support under the Renewable Heat Incentive 
(RHI). Billington focusses on reliability of supply, 
ensuring a secure supply of consistent quality 
heating pellets for our customers delivered 
through: a robust sustainable purchasing 
strategy; strategic stock holdings; our depot 
network; the latest delivery vehicle technology, 
driven by well trained and knowledgeable 
drivers; and excellent customer service.
Market growth has been driven primarily by 
the RHI. The government has confirmed that 
the RHI will continue to be supported through 
to 2021, encouraging consumers to adopt 
renewable forms of heating such as biomass 
and move away from fossil fuel heating 
systems, mainly heating oil and liquified 
petroleum gas.

Operational review
An excellent standard of customer service 
is central to our proposition across our retail 
business. This good service reputation has 
supported the achieved growth and at Haven 
has resulted in an excellent renewals 
performance in the I&C sector. 
We actively manage credit risk by assessing 
the financial strength of customers and 
applying rigorous credit management 
processes. This is reflected in our low bad 
debt experience to date. 
We have a strong focus on billing and cash 
collection which has resulted in the retail 
business being a net contributor of cash to 
the Group. 
Financial results
Movements in key financial metrics are 
underpinned by continued growth in the 
retail business. For the period in question 
Haven delivered net sales volume growth of 
17% this year to 13.8TWh (2014: 11.8TWh). 
Much of the sales growth continues to be from 
the larger but more competitive I&C market. 
Many of our larger customers are signed up to 
flexible contracts where the customer decides 
when to fix the price of their power, or to leave it 
to day or month ahead prices. As a result, the 
declining wholesale power price in 2015 has 
impacted the average sales price. 
Third Party costs (TPCs) include grid charges, 
the cost of meeting our obligations under the 
RO, small-scale Feed-in-Tariff schemes and the 
cost of Levy Exempt Certificates (LECs) required 
to deliver Renewable or Levy Exempt Power to 
our customers. Grid charges include distribution, 
transmission and system balancing costs. TPCs 
have continued to increase and now account 
for 44% of revenue, as shown in the table to 
the right.
 
The markets have been very competitive 
in both the current and prior period. This, 
combined with the change the Chancellor 
made in July when the exemption from CCL 
was removed for renewable source electricity, 
is reflected in the gross profit performance of 
the retail business. 
Billington Bioenergy also delivered strong 
sales volume growth. Margins were in line with 
expectations of the business for this stage of 
its development.

Employee policies and relations
We have a suite of policies designed to support 
our people at work, including those to assist, 
where appropriate, a variety of work/lifestyle 
preferences, procedures for raising grievance or 
safety concerns, and diversity and inclusion in 
the workplace. We make every effort to provide 
long-term employment security and we maintain 
high standards in employment practices. 
Learning and development
Our personal and career development processes 
across the Group are designed to equip all our 
people with the technical skills, management 
and leadership competencies and personal 
behaviours needed to achieve our Business Plan. 
All employees receive annual performance and 
development reviews. 
In support of the strategic objective to 
deliver excellent people leadership across our 
operations, we ran our first UK-wide leadership 
development programme, accredited by the 
Chartered Management Institute, for 47 
participants at different stages of their 
leadership careers. The programme, delivered 
over 84 days in 2015 and continuing into 2016, 
included facilitated workshops, 1:1 coaching and 
action learning. The content, designed and 
delivered in conjunction with external partners, 
aimed to develop the participants’ leadership 
behaviours – specifically the Drax Group 
behaviours of: communicates effectively; builds 
a great team; inspires others; creates trust and 
respect and makes decisions.
In 2015 Drax Power recruited six new 
apprentices for a four-year training programme 
covering power station operations and 
engineering maintenance.
We have a structured process of succession 
planning for senior roles, with an annual cycle 
culminating in a discussion at the Nominations 
Committee in November. The process identifies 
succession potential and gaps, which in turn 
inform individual development/recruitment 
planning. Where possible we seek to identify 
cross-Group moves to accelerate development 
and improve the future leadership pipeline. 
Reward and recognition
We benchmark our reward packages at every 
level in the organisation against the industry 
sector and the market as a whole, nationally or 
locally, as appropriate to the role. Through a 
range of share plans we encourage all UK 
employees to build a personal stake in the 
ownership of the business. 
Employee engagement
In October we conducted an engagement 
survey across all our UK employees, with a view 
to including our US employees in a Group-
wide survey in 2016. The survey, designed 
and run in conjunction with Towers Watson, 
achieved an overall 76% participation rate. The 
results for all categories of question showed a 
positive variance with Towers Watson’s Global 
Energy and Utilities norm. A programme of 
‘results-to-action’ will be implemented across 
the UK business in 2016, with regular progress 
reports to management teams and the Board.
Employee representation
39% of the Group’s workforce is covered by 
collective bargaining and for the remainder 
who are employed on individual employment 
contracts we have representative employee 
consultation and information arrangements 
in place. 
We use a variety of communication channels 
to ensure that all colleagues are kept fully 
informed of developments in the Group’s 
operations and provided with the opportunity 
to give feedback.

Environmental performance and compliance
Environmental compliance of our power 
station and associated landfill site is managed 
through an environmental management 
system. This system is externally certified to 
the international standard ISO 14001:2004 
and is subject to external audit twice a year.
There were no major breaches of our 
environmental consents during 2015.
Emissions to air
In the table below, in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006, we set out our 
carbon reporting information for direct 
emissions (“Scope 1”) from activities such as 
fuel combustion and processing and also 
indirect emissions (“Scope 2”) being the 
equivalent emissions created by the generation 
of the electricity, heat or steam we purchase. 
Scope 1 for Drax covers the emissions arising 
from burning fossil fuels, namely coal but 
also heavy fuel oil and propane, to generate 
electricity and the operation of some of our 
plant at the power station, for example, our 
flue-gas desulphurisation system. The Group’s 
Scope 2 emissions arise mainly from electricity 
purchased to run operations across our 
various sites.
We are also required to disclose emissions from 
biologically sequestered carbon, which includes 
emissions released through burning biomass to 
generate electricity.

Through implementing our strategy to 
become a predominantly biomass-fuelled 
generator we aim to reduce our Scope 1 and 
2 emissions. As a result there will be a rise in 
biologically sequestered carbon emissions. 
We collate data on our carbon dioxide 
emissions from fuel combustion as part of 
our measurement and reporting plan under 
the EU ETS. This includes all Scope 1 and the 
biologically sequestered carbon figures. For 
Scope 2 reporting we use the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and 
the government’s published GHG 
conversion factors to determine the level 
of carbon emissions.
The majority of our emissions arise through 
the combustion of fossil fuel for generating 
electricity. As this single figure can shadow 
smaller, but still important trends, we have 
set a materiality threshold of 100 thousand 
tonnes, to ensure we strike the right balance 
between demonstrating important trends 
and limiting data to a meaningful level.
Carbon dioxide emissions, calculated under 
the EU ETS, as a ratio of electricity generated, 
before deductions for that used on-site, is a 
principal performance indicator for the Group.

Beyond carbon dioxide we manage all our emissions effectively and have made high levels of 
investment in flue-gas desulphurisation and combustion control systems to ensure compliance with 
environmental limits. All emissions in 2015 were within the limits set by the Environment Agency.
Work continues to implement processes to comply with the emission limits which will be in force 
beyond 2016 under the IED.

Discharges to water
Water is a key resource to Drax Power Station with the great majority of the cooling water 
abstracted from the River Ouse. Other minor sources include the Sherwood Sandstone Aquifer 
and town’s mains. Procedures are in place to manage and monitor the drainage and water systems 
on-site so as to ensure all discharge consent limits are met. The water we abstract is principally 
used for cooling with some used within the steam system and other ancillary processes. From this 
we return in the region of half of the water abstracted back to the River Ouse, with procedures in 
place to manage and monitor the drainage and water systems on-site so as to ensure all discharge 
consent limits are met.

Disposals to land
We have continued to invest in site 
infrastructure to maximise the sale of ash 
products into the construction industry and to 
reduce the disposal of surplus ash to landfill. In 
2015, ash was sold in conformity with European 
construction product standards and in 
compliance with the Pulverised Fuel Ash 
Quality Protocol. 
This has helped us to sell a million tonnes 
of ash produced in 2015 as replacement for 
virgin aggregates and as a cement 
replacement product.
We pay landfill tax on ash disposed. Through 
the Landfill Communities Fund, we are able 
to claim a tax credit for our donations to 
recognised Environmental Bodies. We have 
worked with Groundwork North Yorkshire 
since 2001 on projects designed to help 
mitigate the effects of landfill upon our local 
community. During 2015, we contributed 
£30,771 towards local community-based 
projects designed to bring about sustainable 
environmental benefits and contribute to the 
social and economic regeneration of the area.
We continue to manage waste from our 
operations in a responsible manner. In 2015, 
we diverted 94% of non-ash waste from landfill.

Business conduct
We are committed to high ethical standards 
and to conducting our business with honesty 
and integrity and in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations. 
In order to prevent bribery and corruption we 
take responsibility for maintaining a culture 
within the Group in which bribery is never 
acceptable. In protecting fundamental 
human rights, Drax does not tolerate the 
use of underage workers or any concept of 
forced labour, at the same time ensuring our 
suppliers’ activities have a minimal impact on 
the environment and local communities. Any 
supplier found to be complicit in a breach of 
such standards, either directly or indirectly, 
will be barred from further participation in our 
supply chain activities.
The Group’s Code of Business Ethics establishes 
the rules and framework on which employees 
should base their decision making. Employees 
are expected to follow not only the letter of the 
Code, but the spirit.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy provides 
a confidential means for our employees to 
speak up with confidence. The policy provides 
guidance on how to make a disclosure of 
information, in good faith, relating to safety, 
fraud or other illegal or unethical conduct 
that an employee may have witnessed or is 
concerned about.
The Group appreciates that public policy 
on taxation and the external tax environment 
are constantly evolving and this is reflected in 
our tax strategy. In 2015, the Group made a 
significant contribution to local and national 
communities in which it operates, with paid 
taxes in excess of £200 million, comprising 
taxes on profit, labour and payroll taxes, taxes 
on burning fossil fuels, and environmental 
taxes (but excluding VAT).
Supply chain
Non-fuel procurement
We take a balanced approach to our supply 
chain and we look to use suppliers and working 
partners from diverse backgrounds, in particular, 
small and medium-sized suppliers in the local 
community where possible.
We recognise that prompt payment is critical to 
the cash flow of our suppliers, particularly the 
smaller businesses, and as a signatory to the 
Prompt Payment Code, we commit to paying 
our suppliers on time. 
Sustainability is an essential element of good 
procurement practice and takes account of 
wider social, economic and environmental 
factors in addition to the conventional criteria 
of price, quality and service. By applying these 
wider principles our procurement practices go 
beyond meeting simple tender requirements to 
delivering improved value and real cost savings 
throughout the supply chain. 
Coal procurement
We buy coal from a range of sources with 
the objectives of managing our commercial 
exposures, environmental obligations and 
diversity of supply. In 2015, 46% of the coal we 
burnt came from UK deep and surface mines 
with the remainder coming from major supply 
basins around the world, including the US, 
Colombia and Russia.
When buying from overseas we have 
continued to require, through our contracts, 
minimum standards with suppliers in respect 
of compliance with legislation, human rights, 
labour relations and health and safety 
arrangements. To this end Drax is an active 
member of an initiative called Bettercoal, a 
not-for-profit organisation founded by a 
number of major European coal generators. 
The organisation encourages greater 
transparency throughout the supply chain. 
Through Bettercoal, Drax encourages mining 
companies to demonstrate that they operate 
in a socially responsible way.
Bettercoal assesses mines against a set 
of standards covering social, ethical and 
environmental issues. Bettercoal is based on 
human rights principles, International Labour 
Organisation conventions and environmental 
performance. Drax encourages all coal 
suppliers to gain Bettercoal certification.

Customer relations
Customers and their consultants are at the heart 
of our Retail business. All of our customers have 
named account managers who are responsible 
for the service that we deliver. We continue to 
build on our reputation for providing good 
service and this supports an ongoing good 
level of renewal at the end of customers’ 
supply contracts.
We held a range of events throughout the year 
targeted at customers, prospective customers 
and their consultants to inform and educate 
them about our business and other industry 
developments. These events share information 
which is invaluable to customers and 
consultants and provide us with the opportunity 
to obtain direct feedback to better meet their 
needs. Events such as these complement the 
high level of service and account management 
we offer and this is reflected in our positive 
customer satisfaction results.
Our online portal community continues to grow 
and offers our larger customers 24/7 access to 
bills and statements as well as consumption 
data and flexible purchasing information. 
Investor relations
We are committed to delivering shareholder 
value. We communicate our results and 
prospects to our shareholders in an accurate 
and timely manner using a variety of channels. 
In addition to the Annual General Meeting, we 
communicate through our Preliminary and 
Interim results announcements. Annual report 
and accounts and Trading updates. All of these 
documents are made available on our website at 
www.drax.com. Significant matters relating to 
trading and the development of the business 
are disseminated to the market by way of 
announcements via a regulatory information 
service and those announcements appear as 
soon as practicable on our website.
Announcements are frequently followed up 
with either conference calls or presentations to 
provide further detail and greater understanding. 
In addition, face-to-face meetings are held with 
our major institutional shareholders, and other 
potential investors in the Group, to assist them in 
their understanding of the announcements and 
also to ensure that the Board is aware of their 
views and concerns. 
To aid our communication with private 
investors, the investor section of our website 
has been developed to be a readily accessible 
and transparent source of information to 
enhance understanding of the business.
Public affairs
The business maintains good working 
relationships with public affairs audiences in the 
UK, US and EU on issues with implications for our 
business. With energy policy high on the political 
agenda in 2015 we had significant engagement 
with elected representatives and officials at all 
levels on wide variety of sector related issues 
including forthcoming environmental legislation, 
renewables policy and market reform issues.
The form of engagement was varied and 
included both face-to-face and written 
briefings, participation in public consultations, 
written evidence to inquiries and visits by 
elected representatives and officials to Drax 
Power Station. As in the past, membership of a 
number of trade association proved helpful to 
the Group. The ability to meet with and discuss 
issues of the day with other interested parties 
has facilitated presentation of collective 
positions on energy policy matters.
No political donations were made in the UK or 
elsewhere during 2015 (2014: nil), and the 
Group’s contact with those active in the 
political arena has been and will continue to be 
aimed solely at the promotion of the Group’s 
business interests.
The definitions of EU political expenditure are 
broad and there is uncertainty about the extent 
to which normal business activities, which 
might not be thought to be political 
expenditure in the usual sense, could be 
considered to be political expenditure within 
the meaning of the legislation. The Company 
wishes to avoid any inadvertent infringement of 
the legislation and each year, through a 
resolution at the Annual General Meeting, 
seeks the authority of shareholders to incur 
expenditure for the Company and its 
subsidiaries for such purposes of £100,000.

Community relations
We are committed to being a good neighbour 
to our local community and we are involved in 
a number of local and regional community 
initiatives. Our involvement takes the form 
of sponsoring a variety of local charities and 
fundraising events, promoting our own 
campaigns which focus on education 
and the environment. We also maintain 
open communication channels and good 
working relationships with the region’s key 
opinion formers.
Sponsorship and fundraising
During 2015, the Group gave financial 
support of £296,000 (2014: £228,000) in total 
across a range of charitable and non-charitable 
community causes. Of that total, charitable 
donations amounted to £155,000 
(2014: £154,000).
 
Education in the community
We provide a choice of educational experiences 
hosted by our team of power station guides and, 
at times, technical experts. A state-of-the-art 
visitor centre is of particular interest to students 
of all ages allowing them to explore the 
properties of electricity, discover how a power 
station works and consider the environmental 
issues related to electricity generation.
Another visitor opportunity exists at our nature 
reserve that lies at the heart of our ash disposal 
site. Established as a sanctuary for over 100 
species of wildlife, it is specially designed to 
help schoolchildren understand more about 
the natural habitat and ecology of the area.
Campaigns such as “Drax in the Classroom” and 
the “Community Pride Awards” are now firmly 
established in the annual calendar of local 
events and continue to prove popular.
Visitors to Drax
During 2015, we played host to more than 
12,500 visitors through organised tours of the 
power station, and various activity days and 
charity events. The tours and activities have 
wide appeal attracting schools and colleges 
as well as business organisations, local and 
professional associations and members of 
our community.

Group financial review
Despite challenging market conditions 
our financial performance has been 
creditable, underpinned by continuing 
strength in our operations.
Will Gardiner
Chief Financial Officer
 £46m
Underlying earnings
(2014: £96m)
2015 was a difficult year for all of our 
businesses. We have seen the lowest 
market power prices for many years, weather 
conditions in the US south have not been ideal 
for pellet manufacturing and we continue to 
see rising third party costs for power retail.
Furthermore, the government’s announcement 
of the cessation of the CCL exemption for 
renewable power in July removed £30 million of 
renewable support from our 2015 earnings and 
up to a further £60 million in 2016.
However, we have successfully taken actions 
to minimise the impact of these uncontrollable 
events on our financial results without 
compromising our operational capacity. 
Furthermore, matters within our control 
have gone well.
We have capitalised on the flexibility of 
our generation assets to capture value in the 
prompt power markets and have managed to 
add incremental margin through enhancements 
in our fuel sourcing activities.
In our Retail operations, we delivered another 
year of record sales in a very competitive 
marketplace. In Biomass Supply, we have a strong 
team in place and are making good progress 
optimising our pellet production operations.
Our EBITDA for 2015 was £169 million, £60 million 
lower than 2014 but only slightly behind our 
expectations at the start of the year, in spite of 
the numerous challenges faced. Underlying 
earnings of £46 million drive a total dividend of 
5.7 pence per share.
Alongside this creditable financial performance, 
we achieved our long-stated aim of becoming a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled generator on time 
and on budget, with a third unit coming on line as 
an enhanced co-fired unit in July. Upstream, in 
the US, both our pellet plant and port assets were 
successfully commissioned at a total cost within 
initial projections.
I am confident we have a strong team, sound 
business model and robust balance sheet to 
capitalise on future opportunities for growth 
should they arise. At the same time, we are 
prepared for a variety of eventualities in an 
ever-changing and challenging environment.

Financial performance
Gross margin performance
Consolidated gross margin of £409 million 
(2014: £450 million) principally reflects another 
year of strong operations at Drax Power, our 
generation business. 
As described above, commodity markets have 
been challenging in 2015 and we experienced 
lower profitability than in previous years as 
a result. 
Our margins were further reduced from July 
onwards, following the removal of the CCL 
exemption, which removed a source of 
renewable subsidy for our Generation business 
and prompted a review of product offerings in 
our Retail business.
Despite these challenges, the factors within 
our control have gone well. Within Drax Power 
we delivered excellent availability and reliability 
and successfully implemented a two-shift 
regime on our coal units to maximise the 
available returns.
Supplementing this, Haven Power delivered 
another year of strong growth (13.8TWh 
compared to 11.8TWh in 2014) and our US pellet 
plants and port facility became operational 
during the year to make a small  gross 
margin contribution.
Looking forward we are focused on improving 
retail margins and extracting value from the 
flexibility of our generation plant.
Operating costs
Consolidated operating costs of £240 million 
(2014: £220 million) have increased by £20 
million from the previous year.
2015 saw the commencement of commercial 
operations within our US business following 
the commissioning of both pellet plants and 
the port facility. As a result, the operating costs 
of the Biomass Supply operation increased 
177% to £24 million.
The remaining increase in our operating costs 
year-on-year reflects the very busy outage 
schedule at Drax Power, including the 
modifications required to enable our third 
biomass unit to operate on an enhanced co-fired 
basis and the write off of certain maintenance 
spare parts that are now obsolete as a result.
Looking ahead we are very focused on cost 
control and have already taken action to reduce 
our cost base for 2016 and beyond. This will be 
achieved by constantly driving efficiency 
throughout the business.
EBITDA
Consolidated EBITDA of £169 million (2014: 
£229 million) is £60 million lower than the 
previous year.
EBITDA is a function of the movements in gross 
margin and operating costs described above, 
and is the key measure we use to appraise our 
financial performance.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings measures our overall 
financial performance. It is calculated as our net 
profit (in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards) adjusted to exclude any 
unrealised gains or losses (such as those arising 
from the application of fair value accounting to 
our forward purchase and sale contracts as 
required by International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), one-off transactions that do 
not reflect the ongoing performance of the 
business, and the associated tax effect of both.
Underlying earnings of £46 million in 2015 (2014: 
£96 million) reflect the lower EBITDA described 
above and higher depreciation charges, as a 
result of our investments in biomass technology 
over the last three years, partially offset by the 
positive accounting effect of reductions in 
future corporation tax rates announced in the 
Summer Budget statement.
Financial instruments
A key component of the Group’s risk 
management strategy is the use of forward 
contracts to secure and de-risk the future 
cash flows of the business. 
We recognised unrealised gains of £124 million 
(2014: £66 million) within the income statement, 
below EBITDA and excluded from underlying 
earnings, in respect of outstanding contracts for 
future delivery. This predominantly reflects the 
impact of strengthening of the US dollar versus 
sterling on the value of our portfolio of foreign 
currency exchange contracts.
The accounting for these contracts is set out in 
further detail in note 7.2 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

Financial position
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure of £174 million, reduced 
from £201 million in 2014, reflects continued 
investment in biomass technology, both in 
developing our biomass pellet plants in the US 
and bringing a third unit on line at Drax Power 
Station as an enhanced co-fired biomass unit.
We have also installed Selective Non-Catalytic 
Reduction (SNCR) technology on four of our 
generating units this year, at a cost of £33 
million, in preparation for the requirements 
of the IED which come into force from 2016. 
Total spend on our biomass transformation 
project, since we embarked on this strategy in 
2012 (which includes the cost of IED compliance 
work) remains in line with original estimates 
at £640 million, with a relatively low level of 
expenditure expected in 2016-17 to conclude 
the conversion of the third unit and IED work. 
Asset obsolescence charges
As we reach the conclusion of our biomass 
transformation plans, certain assets 
previously utilised in our coal generation 
operations at the power station are no 
longer required, predominantly comprised 
of FGD plant. The emissions characteristics 
of converted biomass units are such that 
FGD is not needed on these units.
Total income statement charges in respect 
of these assets were £109 million, which 
as one-off charges are not reflective of 
the underlying performance of the Group, 
have been excluded from underlying 
earnings and, thus, distributions.
Cash generated from operations
Cash generated from operations amounted 
to £167 million in 2015, a £40 million increase 
on the previous year, in part demonstrating 
the benefit of self-help actions.
Despite the reduction in profitability year 
on year our focus on efficient working 
capital management, including a controlled 
run-down of coal stocks, helped to 
release £95 million of cash, compared 
to an £84 million outflow in 2014.
This significant improvement was offset by 
an £86 million increase in our ROC assets 
(2014: £45 million) as our output from biomass-
fired generation increased. Cash from ROCs 
is typically realised several months after 
the ROC is earned, driven by RO deadlines 
and commercial considerations. We have 
facilities in place to monetise a proportion 
of these assets and continue to explore 
options to accelerate these cash flows.
The overall net cash outflow for the year 
is £47 million (2014: net outflow of £86 
million) and includes capital investments 
of £179 million (2014: £200 million) which 
is falling as we approach the end of our 
biomass transformation, and dividend 
payments of £50 million (2014: £55 million).
Net debt and funding
Net debt at 31 December 2015 is £187 million, 
compared to £99 million at the end of 2014, 
reflecting the cash outflow of £47 million 
described above and a reduction in short-term 
investments of £40 million.
Our primary funding platform has remained 
steady compared to the previous year, with 
£325 million of term loans drawn down. A small 
increase in borrowings reflects the unwinding 
of discounting on our index-linked facilities. The 
maturity profile of our loans extends to 2024.
In December 2015 we successfully concluded 
the refinancing of our revolving credit facility. 
The new £400 million facility matures in 
December 2019 and has a margin of 175 basis 
points over LIBOR. It replaces the existing £400 
million facility which was due to mature in April 
2017 and had a margin of 225 basis points 
over LIBOR.
Our funding package also includes a 
commodity trading line, also successfully 
renewed in December, which enables us to 
transact prescribed volumes of commodity 
trades without having to post collateral. 
Further detail in relation to our funding 
arrangements is included in note 4 to the 
financial statements, on page 125.

Taxation
The 2015 tax charge of £3 million compares to 
£37 million tax charge in 2014. The reduction 
principally reflects the reduction in profit 
before tax in 2015 versus 2014, and an £18 
million impact of a 2% reduction in corporation 
tax rates.
 
The underlying effective rate of tax (excluding 
the post-tax impact of unrealised gains on 
derivatives contracts and one-off asset 
obsolescence charges, as described above) is 
less than the standard rate of corporation tax in 
the UK, the difference arising predominantly 
from the impact of the corporation tax rate 
changes described above. The comparable 
underlying rate in 2014 was 20%, which was 
more aligned with the UK standard rate of tax. 
 
Cash taxes paid during the year were £6 million 
(2014: £16 million), principally reflecting lower 
underlying profit before tax. These payments 
were offset by tax refunds in settlement of prior 
years, bringing net taxes paid in 2015 to £4 
million (2014: £14 million).
Acquisition of Billington Bioenergy
In March 2015 we welcomed Billington 
Bioenergy, the second largest operator in 
the UK’s biomass heat market, to the Group. 
Consideration totalled £4 million paid in cash.
We are confident that the acquisition 
represents a good strategic fit for Drax. It is a 
natural extension to our core biomass business 
and a small but clear opportunity to more fully 
utilise our status as the world leader in 
biomass technology.
We are pleased with the performance at 
Billington in the short time it has been part of 
the Group, with total wood pellet deliveries of 
21 Kt in the year, and turnover of £5 million.
Long-term value
We remain confident in the long term strategic 
value of the Group to the UK energy sector and 
accordingly believe there are many opportunities 
to deliver longer-term value for our shareholders.
2015 was characterised by low commodity 
markets and, significantly for Drax, the decision 
by the government to remove the CCL exemption 
for power generated from renewable sources, 
from August.
As a result of these two factors our share 
price has declined substantially during the 
year to the extent that our market capitalisation 
fell materially below the book value of our 
assets. Accordingly, we have undertaken a 
comprehensive and wide-ranging review of the 
value of our business, to ensure those assets 
are not impaired.
The review, which is further detailed in note 2.3 
to the financial statements, reinforced our view 
that the Group is well placed to deliver future 
value and that the carrying value of our assets 
remains appropriate.
Looking forward, we expect 2016 to be 
characterised by continuing challenging 
commodity markets and, as set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on page 22, we are meeting 
the challenge head-on with a firm focus on 
revenue development and cost control, whilst 
awaiting the outcome of the EU investigation 
into the award of a CfD for our third biomass 
conversion.
Distributions
We remain committed to our policy of 
distributing 50% of underlying earnings in each 
year. Underlying earnings for the year ended 
31 December 2015 were £46 million (2014: 
£96 million).
A full reconciliation of net profit, calculcated 
in accordance with IFRS, to underlying 
earnings is provided within note 2.6 to the 
financial statements.
On 17 February 2015 the Board resolved, 
subject to approval by shareholders at the

Viability statement
Statement of viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 version of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period 
significantly longer than the 12 months 
required by the going concern provision.
In preparing this assessment of viability 
the Board has considered the principal 
risks faced by the Group, relevant financial 
forecasts and sensitivities, the availability 
of adequate funding and the strength 
of the Group’s control environment.
Assessment period
The Board conducted this assessment over a 
period of three years, which was selected for 
the following reasons:
– 
The Group’s Business Plan (the “Plan”), 
which is reviewed and assessed on a 
quarterly basis and is used for strategic 
decision making, includes a range of 
financial forecasts and associated 
sensitivity analysis. This Plan covers a 
three-year period in detail. 
– 
Within the three year period liquid 
commodity market curves are used for 
valuations. Typically these curves cover a 
two year window and beyond this horizon, 
given the lack of forward liquidity in power 
markets, commodity price assumptions are 
derived using publically available 
information and the Group’s own estimates. 
– 
The majority of the Group’s financing 
facilities are available beyond the three 
year horizon.
In selecting this period the Board have 
assumed no material changes to the Group’s 
mid-term regulatory environment and 
associated support regimes. This includes 
revenues from ROCs and CfD and the access 
of coal-generated electricity to the UK’s grid. 
Review of principal risks
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, 
set out in detail on pages 54 to 55, have been 
considered over the period.
The Board considers that Commodity Market 
risk has the most influence upon the continued 
viability of the Group. A material downturn in 
commodity prices, adversely impacting 
spreads, could place stress upon the ability of 
the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due. 
The prospects of the Group are also strongly 
influenced by government policy in relation to 
subsidies available for generation of renewable 
power. Failure to secure and retain sufficient 
subsidies could have a material impact on the 
viability of the Group. 
The principal risks have been valued, where 
possible, to assess the potential impact of each 
on the viability of the Group, should that risk 
arise in its unmitigated form. The valuations 
have been included, where appropriate, as 
sensitivities to the Plan and considered by the 
Board as part of the approval process required 
before the Plan is adopted by the Group.

Review of financial forecasts
The Plan considers the Group’s financial 
position, performance, cash flows, covenant 
compliance and other key financial ratios 
over the period and was most recently 
updated to reflect current market and 
environment conditions in December 2015.
The Plan includes certain assumptions, the 
most material of which relate to commodity 
market price curves and levels of subsidy 
support available to the Group through the 
generation of biomass-backed renewable 
power. The Group continues to await the 
outcome of a State aid review by the EU of 
a CfD, providing a strike price for the sale 
of renewable power. The outcome of this 
review is expected during 2016 and the 
Plan includes an assumption that State aid 
clearance will be obtained during the year. 
The Plan is also subject to stress testing, 
which involves the construction of reasonably 
foreseeable scenarios, including those 
aligned to the principal risks, which test the 
robustness of the Plan when key variables 
are flexed both individually and in unison. 
Where such a scenario suggests a risk 
to viability, the availability and quantum 
of mitigating actions is considered.
The Board considers the most significant 
scenario in the assessment period to be a 
combination of a failure to secure State aid 
clearance for the CfD during 2016 and a 
deterioration of commodity market prices, 
leading to a fall in the available price for 
power and thus a fall in the margins available 
to the Group from its power generation 
activities. This has been considered in the 
Plan and the Board is satisfied that in such 
a scenario sufficient actions could be taken 
to preserve the viability of the Group.
Availability of adequate funding
The sources of funding available to the Group 
are set out in note 4.4 to the consolidated 
financial statements (see page 125). The 
Board expects these sources, along with 
cash flows generated by the Group from its 
normal operations, to provide adequate levels 
of funding to support the execution of the 
Group’s Plan over the three-year period.
Expectations
The directors have considered all the factors 
in their assessment of viability over the next 
three years, including the latest Plan, scenario 
analysis, levels of funding, control environment 
and the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group. The directors have also considered 
the availability of actions within their control 
in the event of plausible negative scenarios 
occurring. They have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three-year period of their assessment.
Strategic report
The strategic report is set out on pages 1–55 
of this document and was approved by the 
Board of directors’ on 22 February 2016.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group has a comprehensive system of governance controls in 
place to manage risks. Policies have been established in key areas 
of the business such as biomass sustainability, trading, treasury, 
production and health and safety to ensure that these risks are 
managed in a controlled manner and in accordance with the 
policies set by the Board.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. A process has been established 
for identifying, evaluating, determining risk appetite and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group and this has been in place 
for the year under review up to the date of approval of the 2015 
Annual report and accounts. 
Will Gardiner
Chief Financial Officer
The process is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Risk management committees
There are seven business risk management committees (RMCs):
1  Group corporate services risk management committee
2  Drax Power safety, health, environmental and production 
integrity committee
3  Drax Power currency and commodity risk management 
committee
4  Drax Power corporate services risk management committee
5  Haven Power risk management committee
6  Drax Biomass risk management committee
7  Billington Bioenergy risk management committee
Each committee is responsible for ensuring that all risks associated 
with its specific area of the business are identified, analysed and 
managed systematically and appropriately. Each committee has 
terms of reference that require systems and controls to be approved, 
implemented and monitored in order to ensure that activities are 
commensurate with the risk appetite established by the Board, are 
adequately resourced and comply with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
Risks identified and managed by the RMCs are regularly reviewed 
at the Executive Committee of the Group, as well as by the Drax 
Group plc Board.

Risk management process
The key elements of the risk management process are as follows:
Risk identification – risks faced by the Group are identified during 
the formulation of the Business Plan. Senior management and risk 
owners, with the assistance of the risk management committees, 
periodically review the risks to ensure that the risk management 
processes and controls in their area are appropriate and effective, 
and that new risks are identified. A top down risk review is 
conducted at least annually. 
Risk analysis – the basic causes of each risk are considered, 
and the impact and likelihood of it materialising is assessed. Risk 
registers are used to document the risks identified, level of severity 
and probability, ownership and mitigation measures for each risk. 
The risk registers are reviewed by the risk management 
committees on at least a quarterly basis.
Risks are then logged with reference to impact and probability 
as follows:
Low
Medium
High
Low
Medium
High
Probability
Impact
Risk appetite is identified by reference to the same criteria. The 
analysis enables decisions to be taken as to how that risk should be 
managed by applying mitigation measures to align the risk with the 
identified risk appetite.
Risk monitoring and assurance – the Board is ultimately 
responsible for this system of risk management and internal 
control. The Audit Committee reviews the suitability and 
effectiveness of risk management processes and controls on 
behalf of the Board. Risk management committees assist the 
executive directors in the operation and implementation of the risk 
management process, and provide a source of assurance to the 
Audit Committee that the process is operating effectively. Each 
risk committee reports to the Board at least annually. 
Internal control
In addition, the Group has a comprehensive and well-defined 
internal control system with clear structures, delegated authority 
levels and accountabilities. 
The Group has a system of planning and monitoring, which 
incorporates Board approval of a rolling five-year Business Plan 
and approval of operating and capital expenditure budgets. 
Performance against the budget is subsequently monitored and 
reported to the Board on a monthly basis. The Board also monitors 
overall Group performance against a Scorecard which shows 
progress against a set of financial, operating, safety and other 
targets set at the start of the year. Performance is reported 
formally to shareholders through the publication of Group results. 
Operational management makes frequent reports on performance 
to the executive directors.
The Group also has processes in place for business continuity and 
emergency planning.
Through the Audit Committee, the Board has implemented a 
programme of internal audit reviews of different aspects of the 
Group’s activities. The programme, which is reviewed and updated 
annually, is designed so that, over time, all facets of the business are 
reviewed to ensure appropriate systems of control are in place and 
are working effectively or, where they are not, deficiencies are 
rectified by timely and appropriate action. In agreeing the actions 
to be taken in response to each report, the aim is always to embed 
internal controls, including measures intended effectively to identify 
and manage risk, within each area of the Group’s operations. In 
parallel with its work in relation to internal audit, the Audit 
Committee also satisfies itself that an action plan for dealing with 
points raised by the external auditor in their yearly management 
letter is being properly addressed by management.
With the assistance of the Audit Committee, the Board has 
reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control. 
It has reviewed the reports of the Audit Committee, which has 
considered all significant aspects of internal control including 
financial, operational, trading, compliance, social, environmental 
and ethical risks in accordance with the “Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the UK Corporate Governance Code”.
Following its review, the Board determined that it was not aware of 
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of 
internal control.
 
Change in risk profile
There are five principal risks monitored by the Board: Regulatory 
and Political risk, Biomass risks, Generating Plant Operating risk, 
Trading and Commodity risk and Corporate risks.
During 2015, the perceived level of risk arising from three of these 
principal risks (Regulatory and Political, Biomass and Trading and 
Commodity) increased, with the other two remaining constant. 
Further details and the changes in 2015 driving this assessment 
are set out on pages 54 to 55.

Dear Shareholder
Directorate changes
There have been some significant changes to the composition 
of the Board of your Company during 2015. 
Charles Berry stepped down from the Board following the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in April after six years of excellent 
chairmanship. I am delighted to have the opportunity to take over 
from him. Charles left behind a strong governance framework that 
works well both at Board level and throughout the organisation. 
This framework has helped support the management transition 
and will be fundamental to our meeting the challenges ahead. 
We have had a change of Chief Financial Officer following Tony 
Quinlan’s resignation in May and the appointment of his 
replacement, Will Gardiner, in November 2015. 
We have also seen changes amongst the other executive 
directorships at the end of the year with both Peter Emery and Paul 
Taylor stepping down from the Board. Peter’s departure followed 
the completion of the transition to the new executive management 
structure introduced earlier in the year. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank Peter for his great contribution over the last 11 
years. He has been the key individual responsible for Drax’s excellent 
operational and safety performance throughout its transformation 
to becoming a predominantly renewable power generator. In Paul’s 
case, I want to thank him for his contribution, and I am delighted that 
we will still have the benefit of his experience and expertise as he will 
be helping us on a part-time basis. 
Andy Koss, Chief Executive of Drax Power, the Company’s power 
generation business, was appointed as a director of the Company 
with effect from 1 January 2016. Andy joined Drax in 2005, and has 
held a number of senior roles in finance and regulation. He brings 
substantial experience and expertise to the Board. 
Finally, Melanie Gee will now be resigning from the Board 
immediately after the AGM in April 2016 and I would like to thank 
her for her valuable contribution over the past three years.
Succession planning and diversity
Andy Koss’s appointment to the Board demonstrates the 
effectiveness of the Group’s robust succession planning process, 
which the Board and I consider to be vitally important to the future 
success of the business. Refreshing the Board, and selecting the 
right individuals for the senior positions in the business from a 
diverse talent pool are key priorities for me and for the Board. 
I believe that we have a strong Board with the right blend of 
skills and experience to take the Company forward. As the Group 
develops, we may need to add new expertise to the Board, and 
through the Nominations Committee, we will ensure that the 
skills and experience needed to lead the Company are 
continually reviewed.
At the date of this report, 25% of the Board members are women 
and this is broadly representative of the gender split across the 
whole organisation. Diversity in its widest sense, including gender 
diversity, will continue to be one of the factors that the Board will 
take into consideration in making any future appointments. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code and governance 
at Drax
Our governance reporting is against the 2014 version of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and with the exception of the 
provisions relating to tendering the appointment of auditors, 
which was reported on last year and which will be addressed in 
2016, I am pleased to say that we complied with the remainder of 
the provisions of the Code throughout the reporting year and up to 
the date of approval of this report. More detail on our governance 
arrangements is set out on the following pages.

Letter from the Chairman
We continually work to ensure that our 
governance structures and processes are 
aligned with the requirements of the business 
and that good governance is embedded by 
management throughout the Group.

Governance
As a Board we recognise that there is always scope for improvement 
to make us better able to achieve our aspirations and deal with the 
challenges we face. To address this, we continually work to ensure 
that our governance structures and processes are aligned with the 
requirements of the business and that good governance is 
embedded by management throughout the Group. At Drax we 
believe that governance is not only about following the rules, but 
also about doing things in the right way. I believe that it is important 
for the Board to establish and lead a strong moral and ethical culture 
within an organisation. The values of the Group are expressed as, 
honest, energised, achieving and together, or “HEAT” as it is known 
within the business. These values have been established for several 
years, and are embedded throughout the organisation in the way 
our people go about their everyday business. 
This section of the report describes our corporate governance 
structure and processes and how they have been applied 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2015.
My role as Chairman
I see that it is my role to ensure that your Company has a 
Board which works effectively under my leadership. One of 
my most important tasks in this regard is to maintain the right 
dynamics on the Board, which requires effective contributions 
and constructive challenge from individual directors. I am pleased 
to say that we have directors on our Board with a broad range of 
skills, experience and attributes, all of which contribute to our 
effectiveness. Communication and working relations between 
Board members is good, open and constructive. 
My relationship with Dorothy Thompson, our Group Chief 
Executive, is positive and we are in frequent contact to discuss 
issues which the executive team deals with on a day-to-day 
basis and matters which need to be considered by the Board. 
As Chairman, I lead the setting of the Board agenda, ensuring we 
have adequate time to discuss all necessary items, particularly the 
development and implementation of strategy. Part of my role as 
Chairman is also to ensure that the Board is aware of the views of 
shareholders. The Company and its management benefit from the 
support of a stable group of major shareholders who have been 
supportive even in the challenging times that have been principally 
outside management’s control. I have found this to be the case 
from the meetings I’ve had with some of our largest shareholders. 
Board and committee evaluation
I see regular and appropriate board and committee evaluation 
as essential to improving board effectiveness. During my first 
year in office, I felt it important to understand how the Board, 
its committees and individual directors function and therefore 
decided to conduct the evaluation process internally. This will 
then provide me with a platform from which to launch an 
externally facilitated evaluation next year. 
Our 2015 evaluation is built on the previous years’ reviews 
of strategy, objectives, performance monitoring, succession, 
management development, process and governance. However, 
this year the review concentrated on a broader approach looking 
at the quality of the Board’s work and addressing the manner in 
which the Board can operate most effectively to meet the 
challenges of the risks facing the Group. Later in this report, 
we detail the methodology and outcomes of that process.
Key areas of focus
During 2015, much of the Board’s attention has been directed to 
the two key objectives of maintaining cash flow and profitability in 
the face of the headwinds the business has faced, and ensuring 
that there is a proper process for the development of the Group’s 
strategy. On the former, we took some important decisions 
including the decision not to invest the Group’s capital in the 
development of the White Rose carbon capture and storage 
project. On the latter, the Board considered some excellent early 
work, identifying potential strategic development opportunities. 
Closely linked to this was the work that the Board did to ensure 
that the role biomass can play as a renewable fuel in the 
decarbonisation of energy is properly communicated and 
understood by stakeholders. 
These will continue to be priorities in 2016. The Board will 
also continue to monitor the embedding of the new executive 
management structure so that it is well placed to deliver our 
objectives. We will also continue to review the composition of 
the Board to ensure that we have the right balance of skills and 
experience to meet the challenges we face.

the Business Plan and periodic business reports from senior 
management. It also receives industry, regulatory and topical 
updates from external experts and advisers, from time to time. 
Directors are briefed on matters to be discussed at meetings by 
papers distributed in advance of Board and committee meetings.
The Board has adopted a policy whereby directors may, in the 
furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. During 2015, no director sought 
independent professional advice pursuant to the policy.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board on all 
governance matters, ensuring good information flows within the 
Board, its committees, the Executive Committee and senior 
management, and ensuring that Board processes are complied 
with. He is also responsible for compliance with the Listing, 
Prospectus, Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the 
Companies Act. 
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) give the 
directors power to authorise conflicts of interest. The Board has 
adopted a procedure that has operated effectively, by which 
situations giving rise to potential conflicts of interest are identified 
to the Board, considered for authorisation and recorded. The 
Articles also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in Group 
companies without restriction (e.g. so as to appoint a director to 
the Board of a Group company without this counting as a conflict 
requiring authorisation).
The Company has in place appropriate insurance cover in 
respect of legal action against directors of the Company and 
its subsidiaries.
Details of the selection, appointment, review and re-election 
of directors and of the performance review and directors’ 
development is contained within the Nominations 
Committee report.
Composition
With the exception of Will Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer (who was 
appointed as a director on 16 November 2015) all of the directors 
listed on page 59 served throughout the year. Charles Berry served 
as a director until his retirement on 22 April 2015 and Tony Quinlan 
also served as a director until his resignation on 31 May 2015. 
Michael Scott acted as Interim Finance Director from 1 June until 
15 November 2015 and attended meetings of the Board during that 
period, but was not appointed as a director of the Company. Each of 
those listed, with the exception of Peter Emery and Paul Taylor who 
ceased to be directors on 31 December 2015, continued to be 
directors as at the date of the approval of this report. Andy Koss was 
appointed as a director on 1 January 2016 and is still a director at the 
date of this report. Biographical details of the directors appear on

Notes:
(1) The Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group. In addition to those named above, Peter Bennell (Chief Executive, Haven Power Limited), 
Andy Koss (Chief Executive, Drax Power Limited) and Matthew Rivers (Director of Sustainability) were also members in 2015, as was Michael Scott during the period he acted as 
Interim Finance Director.
(2) Philip Hudson is the Group Company Secretary.
Details of the work of the Nominations, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees are given in the respective reports of those 
committees set out on pages 68 to 94. The terms of reference for 
the committees are reviewed annually by each committee and 
then by the Board and are available on the Group’s website at  
www.drax.com.
Time commitment
Under the terms of his letter of appointment, the Chairman is 
expected to commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to fulfil 
his role.
Under the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment, 
the time commitment each is expected to give in respect of 
membership of the Board, is 12 to 15 full days a year. That includes 
attendance at Board meetings, the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM), one annual Board strategy day and at least one site visit 
per year. In addition, they are expected to devote appropriate 
preparation time ahead of each meeting. The time commitment 
expected in respect of their membership of committees of the 
Board, notably the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees, is an additional three to four full days a year in each 
case. Non-executive directors also spend time with management 
in order to maintain their knowledge of the developing business 
and to understand the operational challenges being faced.
Corporate governance
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, details of which are given in this report.
The various sections of this report contain in summary certain 
provisions of the Company’s current Articles of Association and 
applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 
2006). This is a summary only and the relevant provisions of the 
Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further 
information is required.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing on 
1 January 2015, there has been full compliance with the principles of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) issued in September 
2014, except in respect of the requirement to put the external audit 
out to tender. This will be done during 2016. The manner in which we 
have complied is demonstrated in the details set out in this report. 
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board has 
taken the decision not to comply for the time being with provision 
C.3.7. of the Code, to put the external audit contract out to tender at 
least every 10 years. A detailed explanation is included within the 
Audit Committee report commencing on page 70.

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Governance
Directors’ interests, indemnity arrangements and 
other significant agreements
Other than a service contract between the executive directors 
and a Group company, or as noted in the Remuneration Committee 
report, no director had a material interest at any time during the 
year in any contract of significance with the Company or any of 
its  subsidiary undertakings.
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-executive 
director. None of the non-executive directors who have served 
during the year had any material business or other relationship 
with the Group, and there were no other matters that were likely 
to affect their independence of character and judgement. The 
Board therefore considers all of the non-executive directors 
to be independent, in accordance with Code provision B.1.1.
Relations with key stakeholder groups
Communication with all our stakeholders is an essential part of our 
business. Some specific information regarding communications 
with investors is provided below. Details of communications 
with other stakeholders are contained in the Stakeholder 
engagement section of this report commencing on page 42.
The Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open 
relationship with the Group’s major shareholders and 
communicates directly with them, offering the opportunity to 
meet any other directors in order that the Board can understand 
their views on the Group, be it corporate governance issues or any 
other points they might wish to raise.
The Board also reviews and discusses the investor feedback from 
post-results investor meetings conducted by the Group Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer in the UK, Europe and the 
US. These took place following both the preliminary and half year 
results announcements in 2015. Makinson Cowell, part of the 
KPMG Group, is engaged by the Group to advise and assist in 
relation to communications with shareholders.
The Company’s private registered shareholders hold, in aggregate, 
approximately 0.78% of the issued share capital. The Board is as 
interested in their concerns as it is in the concerns of institutional 
and corporate shareholders. All shareholders are free to put 
questions to the Board at the AGM. Questions asked in person at the 
AGM will receive a verbal response whenever possible. Otherwise, a 
written response will be provided as soon as practicable after the 
AGM. Questions asked at other times will normally receive a written 
response. Shareholders attending the AGM will have an opportunity 
to meet informally with the directors immediately after the meeting.
All information reported to the market via a regulatory information 
service also appears as soon as practicable on the Group’s website.
The directors consider that this Annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. Pages 1 to 55 provide 
an assessment of the Group’s affairs. The Annual report and 
accounts is available to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the AGM. Registered shareholders receive a Form of Proxy 
which provides for a shareholder to vote in favour or against, or to 
indicate abstention as an alternative on each separate resolution. 
Particulars of aggregate proxies lodged are announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and subsequently appear on the Group’s 
website as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the AGM.

The Executive Committee focuses on the Group’s strategy,

Note:
(1)  Charles Berry retired as a director and Committee member on 22 April 2015.
The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee’s 
proceedings to the following Board meeting. 
The Committee has an annual programme of work which is 
designed to fulfil its principal duties. This programme reviews:
 –
Re-election and appointment of directors – The Committee met 
on 16 February 2016, following the completion of the 2015 Board 
evaluation process, and determined that all of the directors who 
are the subject of annual re-election will retire at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for 
re-election. The evaluation of the Board described on page 69 
concluded that the directors offering themselves for election 
and re-election continue to demonstrate commitment to their 
particular role and to perform effectively; 
 –
Size, structure and composition of the Board – At its meeting in 
April 2015 the Committee reviewed the position of Finance 
Director following Tony Quinlan’s intimation of his resignation.  
The Committee put in place a process which ultimately led to the 
appointment in November of Will Gardiner as Tony’s successor.  
At the same meeting, the Committee concluded that the Board, 
constituted with four executive directors, four independent 
non-executive directors and a chairman who was independent on 
appointment, was appropriate for the Company at the time. The 
Board further considered the size, structure and composition of 
the Board at its meeting in November 2015 which followed the 
completion of changes to the Group’s management structure. The 
Committee noted that Peter Emery and Paul Taylor were to leave 
the Board on 31 December 2015. It also agreed to recommend to 
the Board the appointment of Andy Koss, Chief Executive of Drax 
Power, as a director of the Company. The Committee concluded 
that this revised Board constitution with three executive directors 
was appropriate for the Company taking account of the changes 
to the Group’s organisational and management structure. It also 
concluded that the Board collectively has the necessary balance 
of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to enable it to 
discharge its duties;
 –
Membership of Board committees – It is the Board’s policy 
normally to invite all independent non-executive directors to join 
the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees. The 
Committee reviewed this policy and considered that it continues 
to ensure that each of the Committees is constituted with the 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge to enable it to 
discharge its duties; and 
 –
Succession planning – The Committee reviews the succession 
plan at least annually. The Group has a well-established and 
robust succession planning process which covers all Executive 
Committee members and their direct reports, as well as other 
individuals within the Group who have been identified as having 
longer-term potential for senior roles. In the Committee’s opinion 
the plan is well prepared and appropriate for the size of the 
Group’s business and management structure and there are 
considered to be a range of good candidates for senior roles.
Nominations Committee report
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to 
the success of the Group. The Nominations 
Committee plays a key role in achieving this.
Role of the Committee
The principal duties of the Committee are to:
– 
keep under review the structure, size and composition of 
the Board (including the skills, knowledge and experience 
required by it); 
– 
consider succession planning for the directors and other 
senior managers; 
– 
identify and nominate candidates to fill vacancies among 
the directors; and 
– 
review the time required from non-executive directors.

Governance
In addition to the regular programme of work, the Committee also 
considered the question of Board diversity in its widest sense, and 
gender diversity in particular. The Company has actively engaged 
with initiatives promoted by the Department for Business Innovation 
and Skills to improve gender diversity at Board level. The Committee 
recognises the strength that can be achieved through diversity in 
the Group’s management. In particular, it is the Board’s policy to 
ensure that the proportion of women is one of the considerations for 
Board and senior management appointments. That policy is 
implemented as part of the recruitment and selection process. 
Further details of gender diversity in the Group are included in the 
Employees section of the Sustainability review on page 38.
Selection, appointment, review and re-election
Two new appointments to the Board were made during 2015. Philip 
Cox was appointed as a non-executive director on 1 January and 
was appointed as Chairman following Charles Berry’s retirement 
from the Board following the 2015 AGM. Will Gardiner was appointed 
as a director and Chief Financial Officer on 16 November. Andy Koss 
was appointed as a director with effect from 1 January 2016.
The process to appoint Philip Cox was led by David Lindsell, 
the Senior Independent Director, and the process to appoint Will 
Gardiner was led by Dorothy Thompson, the Group Chief Executive. 
Russell Reynolds Associates and JCA Group respectively were 
engaged by the Committee in relation to the process to appoint the 
Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer. In both cases they assisted 
the Committee in developing role and candidate specifications, 
identification of candidates, preparing long and short lists of 
candidates, initial interviews and taking of references. The 
consultants presented detailed reports to the Committee. Members 
of the Committee met with each of the shortlisted candidates prior 
to making a recommendation to the Board.
The Committee did not engage search consultants or advertise in 
relation to the appointment of Andy Koss. The Committee reviewed 
the skills and experience required, taking particular account of Peter 
Emery’s and Paul Taylor’s resignations as directors. Andy has held a 
number of senior finance, regulatory and operational roles with the 
Company and had been identified through the succession planning 
process as having the necessary skills, experience and attributes to 
succeed to a Board role. The Committee recommended Andy’s 
appointment in the best interests of the Company to ensure an 
appropriate level of continuity and consistency on the Board.
 
The Articles provide that one-third of directors shall retire by 
rotation each year and are eligible for re-election by shareholders 
at the AGM. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Company will continue to propose all directors for annual 
re-election. Accordingly, each of Tim Cobbold, Philip Cox, Melanie 
Gee, David Lindsell, Dorothy Thompson and Tony Thorne will retire 
at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election. 
The Articles also require that, following appointment to the Board, 
directors submit themselves for election by shareholders at the 
first AGM following their appointment. The appointments of Will 
Gardiner and Andy Koss were made since the last AGM and, 
therefore, they will retire and offer themselves for election by 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The evaluation of the Board described below concluded that the 
directors offering themselves for election or re-election continue 
to demonstrate commitment, management and industry expertise 
in their particular role and to perform effectively. The election or 
re-election of each director is recommended by the Board. Details 
of the service contracts for the executive directors and letters of 
appointment for the non-executive directors are set out in a table 
on page 90.
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection by 
prior arrangement during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office. They will also be available for inspection at the 
venue of the AGM, prior to the meeting, details of which are 
contained in the Notice of Meeting.
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will be 
appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the Board 
being satisfied as to the director’s performance and commitment, 
and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate AGM, may be renewed 
by mutual agreement. However, it is the Board’s policy not normally 
to extend the aggregate period of service of any independent 
non-executive director beyond nine years, and any proposal made to 
extend a non-executive director’s aggregate period of office beyond 
six years is subject to review, and will be conducted annually, as part 
of the evaluation of the Board.
The Board is satisfied that all of the directors are able to devote 
sufficient time to their duties as directors and there have been no 
material matters arising during 2015 which would affect this.
Performance reviews and directors’ development
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the Group. 
The Committee initiated a review of the effectiveness of the Board, 
its committees and individual directors during 2015. The review 
concluded that all directors have a positive view of the effectiveness 
of the Board and its committees and that all directors continue to 
perform effectively and to demonstrate commitment to their roles. 
There is clear alignment of the directors’ views of the Group’s 
priorities and agreement that the key decisions of the Board focus 
on those priorities. Steps have been identified to improve processes 
and operation of meetings to facilitate greater focus on priorities 
and strategic matters. Measures have also been identified that will 
improve the quality of information provided to the Board to enhance 
its consideration of risk impacts and mitigation measures.
During the year, the Chairman held a meeting with the non-
executive directors in the absence of the executive directors, 
and the Senior Independent Director held a meeting with the 
non-executive directors without the Chairman being present, as 
required by provision A.4.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Board is committed to the development of all employees and 
directors and has reviewed and will periodically continue to review 
each director’s development requirements and make appropriate 
arrangements to address them. All new directors receive an 
induction, including being provided with information about the 
Group and their responsibilities, meetings with key managers and 
visits to the Group’s sites.
In addition, each non-executive director visits operational sites 
both in the UK and the US. Periodically, they also meet with senior 
management to be briefed on the Group’s business and specific 
Board training days are arranged, where appropriate, involving 
presentations on relevant topics.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Nominations 
Committee on 22 February 2016.
Subsequent to the Nominations Committee review and approval 
of the foregoing, on 29 February 2016, the Company announced 
the resignation of Melanie Gee from the Board with effect from 
the conclusion of the 2016 AGM. Accordingly she will not be 
seeking re-election to the Board at the AGM in April 2016.

reports from the external auditor;
– 
the Committee’s rolling annual plan review; and
– 
reports from the internal audit function on the progress of their programme for the year including fee analysis and new internal 
audit reports. 
The Committee continues to focus on specifically identified strategic risk areas, such as biomass sustainability reporting, as well as ensuring 
the provision of a core compliance assurance service. No significant weaknesses were identified in any of the internal audit reports although 
certain improvements in processes and procedures were made as a result of reviews. At its meeting in July 2015 the Committee received 
and reviewed an independent report concerning biomass sustainability controls. The report raised no material weaknesses in policy or 
approach but did highlight the key areas of judgement and risk within the process. Similar to routine internal audit reviews, certain 
improvements in processes and procedures were implemented as a result of recommendations raised in the report.
The Committee has a forward programme of specific review areas, with a focus on risk management processes and internal control 
systems, as well as financial reporting aspects. In addition, the Committee reviews the Group’s general internal control environment on 
an annual basis, including risk management structures, policies and processes, the overall financial control framework, key operational 
controls including production integrity and environmental controls and procedures in relation to bribery, fraud and any non-compliance.
At meetings in February and July 2015, the Committee reviewed the Group’s Preliminary results announcement, Annual report and 
accounts, and the half-year results announcement respectively. At these meetings, the Committee received reports from management 
and the external auditor on the application of accounting policies on significant estimates and judgements made in preparing the 
financial statements, and on the methods used to account for any significant or unusual transactions. 
The Group’s principal accounting policies and the accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions made in the process of applying 
them are set out in the notes to the accounts. In respect of all such matters, the external auditor concurred with the judgements made by 
management and the Committee was satisfied that the accounting policies were applied appropriately and the estimates and judgements 
made were appropriate. In addition, the Committee also satisfied itself of the independence and objectivity of the external auditor on the 
basis set out below under “Independence of the external audit”.

Annual report and accounts 2015
Audit Committee report continued
Reviewing the 2015 Annual report and accounts
At its meeting in February 2016, the Committee reviewed the content of the 2015 Annual report and accounts, alongside a paper on 
accounting issues and judgements impacting the accounts and a report from Deloitte LLP setting out their audit findings. The significant 
issues and judgements considered were as follows:
Matter
Issue and nature of judgement
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Impairment – 
carrying value of 
assets
The fall in the Company’s share price during the year has resulted in the 
carrying amount of the Group’s net assets exceeding the Company’s market 
capitalisation. This is an indication that assets may be impaired.
As a result, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the directors conducted 
an impairment review in respect of the Group’s assets. They did so by comparing 
the present value of future cash flows for each cash generating unit with the 
carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets.
The assumptions that underpin such calculations are, by their nature, dependent 
upon application of judgement and are thus subject to uncertainty.
The Committee reviewed a report from management, supported 
by external advisers, in November 2015 that explained the 
impairment review methodology and how the cash flow forecasts 
utilised in the review had been prepared together with a critical 
analysis of the key assumptions that underpinned them, including 
market benchmarking analysis where appropriate.
The report also included an analysis of reasonably possible 
sensitivities.
The Committee reviewed an updated report at its meeting in 
February 2016 that considered refinements in assumptions and 
key judgements up to the present time, as described in note 2.3.
After challenging management, particularly around the most 
material judgements relating to longer-term value namely levels of 
renewable support and future commodity prices, the Committee 
concluded that a reasonable, supportable and consistent 
approach had been taken in preparing the review and that there 
was no current indication of impairment.
Derivative 
Financial 
Instruments
The Group makes extensive use of derivative financial instruments in order to 
manage key risks facing the business and its balance sheet includes significant 
assets and liabilities arising from derivatives which are stated at their fair value. 
Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognised in the income 
statement or the hedge reserve, when the specific criteria for hedge accounting 
are met.
The fair values for derivative financial instruments are determined using forward 
price curves and, where an instrument incorporates an element of optionality, an 
option pricing model.
The inputs to these calculations include assumptions regarding future 
transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk, and are 
therefore subjective.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s derivative position in February, 
July and November 2015 having regard in particular to the critical 
judgemental areas described in note 7.2 and considered the position 
as at 31 December 2015 at its meeting in February 2016.
Management explained the trends in market prices that 
underpinned changes in the fair value of the derivative portfolio 
and highlighted any new types of derivative instrument for the 
Committee’s consideration.
Further in April 2015 the Committee considered the processes and 
controls that govern the Group’s trading activities in financial oil 
and freight products.
The Committee concluded that the fair value calculations had 
been performed in a reasonable and consistent manner based 
on quoted market prices as explained in note 7.2 and that the 
system of controls in place was fit for purpose. Accordingly, it was 
concluded that the amounts included in the financial statements 
were appropriate.
ROC assets
The Group receives ROCs for generating electricity from sustainable biomass. 
The Group’s balance sheet contains a material amount of such assets at the end 
of December 2015.
ROC assets are initially valued at fair value and subsequently written to net 
realisable value where appropriate.
These calculations require an element of judgement in considering probable 
future sales prices in the market.
The Committee reviewed papers presented by management 
at its meetings in February, July and November, which set out 
the current balance sheet valuation and the key underlying 
assumptions that drive the carrying value, including the 
assessment of likely future sales prices of ROCs. 
At its meeting in February 2016, the Committee reviewed the 
specific assumptions that directly impact the amounts recognised 
in the 2015 financial statements, as explained in note 3.2.
The Committee concluded that the judgements made in valuing 
ROC assets were reasonable, supportable and consistent and 
that, accordingly, the values included the financial statements 
were appropriate.
Fuel inventories
The Group carries a material amount of fuel inventories (predominantly coal and 
biomass in the form of compressed wood pellets) which are measured at the 
lower of their weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, the nature and characteristics 
of the inventories mean that determining the volume of inventory on-site at any 
given time is subject to a degree of estimation. Accordingly, while both coal and 
biomass stocks are measured using equipment regularly calibrated to industry 
standard levels of tolerance, as explained in note 3.3 the potential for actual 
results to vary from initial calculations remains.
Stocks are surveyed at the balance sheet date by either an independent third 
party or electronic scanning equipment and provisions made where appropriate. 
However, both methods rely on assumptions regarding density of the fuel 
surveyed.
In the case of biomass stocks, volumes are measured by reference to a heat based 
and two weight based systems. The three systems produced somewhat different 
results and the lowest of these volume measurements was applied to the price 
history in order to determine weighted average cost. 
The Committee reviewed the processes, including judgements, 
estimates and assumptions made, in respect of fuel inventory 
valuation at its meetings in February, July and November in 2015.
At its meeting in February 2016, the Committee reviewed the 
position and specific judgements made in respect of the 2015 
financial statements.
Having challenged management on the appropriateness of 
the measurements used in determining inventory volumes, 
the Committee concluded that the process and approach 
followed by management had been performed in a reasonable 
and prudent manner.

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Governance
Explanation of the critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions is set out in detail throughout the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements, with a summary on pages 104 
to 105.
The Committee also reviewed the underlying process, internal 
controls, forecasts and relevant assumptions made in preparing 
the new Viability Statement, disclosed on pages 50 to 51 of this 
Annual Report. Having challenged the assumptions made in this 
process and considered the appropriateness of the three-year 
period of assessment adopted, the Committee concluded that 
the process supporting the Viability Statement was robust.
In addition, other matters relating to the application of accounting 
policies or accounting treatment have been considered during the 
year at the February, July and November 2015 meetings, and again 
at the February 2016 meeting in relation to our financial 
statements. These included:
– 
the accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in 
relation to revenue recognition, retirement benefit obligations 
and taxation. Further detail on these areas can be found in the 
consolidated financial statements; and 
– 
other accounting issues, namely in relation to application of 
accounting policies or accounting treatment for capital 
expenditure and consumable parts. Where applicable our 
accounting policies are set out in the relevant note to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Committee met twice in the absence of management with 
each of the external auditor (February and July) and internal auditor 
(April and November). No matters of concern were drawn to the 
Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. The Committee’s 
understanding with both the external and internal auditor is that, 
if they should at any time become aware of any matters giving them 
material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s 
attention via the Chairman of the Committee. Nothing was subject 
to this procedure in the course of the year.
Review of Audit Committee effectiveness by members
In line with the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit 
Committees, the Committee undertook a review of its own 
effectiveness and concluded that the composition of its 
membership, the manner in which it operates and the reviews that 
it undertakes throughout the year all contribute to the continued 
effective functioning of the Committee.
Fair, balanced and understandable view
The Committee reviewed the content of this Annual report and 
accounts and advised the Board that, in its view, taken as a whole, it 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
External auditor effectiveness
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor, Deloitte LLP. This process incorporated feedback from 
management and key individuals across the Group, as well as its 
own experience. The assessment considered the robustness of 
the audit process, the quality of delivery of the audit plan, the 
quality of reporting on findings and recommendations to the 
Committee and management, and the experience and expertise 
of the audit team and the quality of service provided.
Having reviewed Deloitte’s performance during the year and 
satisfied itself of their continuing independence and objectivity 
within the context of applicable regulatory requirements and 
professional standards, the Committee has invited the Board to 
recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor at the 
next Annual General Meeting (AGM) and a resolution to that effect 
appears in the Notice of the AGM.
Independence of the external audit
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy (the Policy), 
in accordance with which the Committee annually reviews the 
quality and cost-effectiveness of the external audit and the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor. The Policy 
can be found on the Company’s website at www.drax.com.
The provisions of the Policy include:
– 
seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in its professional 
judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from it 
an account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s 
independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff; 
– 
a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit work under which: 
• the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain 
categories of work, including those where they may be 
required to audit their own work or make management 
decisions, or where the auditor would act in an advocacy 
role for the Group; 
• there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditor 
to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to 
financial limits;
• all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work 
are reported to the next meeting of the Committee; 
• the balance between the fees paid to the external auditor 
for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee; 
and
– 
a policy on the employment by the Group of former employees 
of the external auditor, the essence of which is to require a 
period of two years to elapse between the cessation of an 
individual’s association with the auditor and appointment to 
any financial reporting oversight role within the Group.

Audit Committee report continued 
The Committee receives reports from the external auditor on its 
own processes and procedures to ensure its independence and 
objectivity and to ensure compliance with the relevant standards.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the 
year for audit and other services are set out in note 2.2 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 114. The external 
auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audit every five years and the current audit partner, James 
Leigh, is in his second year of tenure and took responsibility with 
effect from the 2014 audit.
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice of 
external auditor.
Audit tendering
In accordance with the requirements of Regulation 537/2014 of 
the European Parliament and Council we will put the audit of the 
2017 financial statements out to tender later this year, with a view 
to making a recommendation to shareholders at the 2017 AGM 
that the firm selected as a result of the tender is appointed to audit 
the 2017 financial statements.
Internal audit
During 2015, the Group’s internal audit function was undertaken by 
Grant Thornton UK LLP.
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding 
the internal audit programme and reviews undertaken. 
Recommendations are made to management for process 
improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit 
reports reviewed by the Committee during 2015 included:
– 
Business continuity planning
– 
Key financial controls over expenditure, VAT and fixed assets
– 
Retail credit management 
– 
Payroll taxes and Senior Accounting Officer controls
In addition, at the April and November meetings the 
Committee received reports detailing progress in implementing 
recommendations previously raised by internal audit. Following the 
most recent of these updates in November 2015, the Committee 
was satisfied that management is taking appropriate steps to deal 
with the recommendations raised.
The Committee periodically reviews whether the internal 
audit function is likely to be more effective or efficient if 
provided internally.
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, 
maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal and 
external auditor.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on 
22 February 2016.

Annual statement to shareholders from the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee
2015 has been a challenging year for the Company and for 
the management team. In particular, changes made by the 
government to the regulatory support for renewable generation 
and weak commodity markets have had an adverse impact on 
financial performance. Earlier sections of the Annual report set 
out in detail the operational and financial performance. The 
management team, and indeed the staff as a whole, have 
continued to pursue resolutely the Company’s biomass conversion 
strategy and to operate our three separate business units well. It 
has therefore been a year in which there has been a high measure 
of achievement in aspects within management’s control, but 
factors outside management’s control have damaged financial 
performance and the value of the business. The Committee has 
sought to reflect this position in applying our remuneration policy 
with the aim of ensuring that management is fairly rewarded for 
their actions, but also taking proper account of the fact that our 
shareholders have suffered a significant fall in the value of 
their investment. 
Base salaries
Base salaries were reviewed with effect from 1 April 2015. In line 
with policy, Dorothy Thompson’s, Tony Quinlan’s and Paul Taylor’s 
salaries were reviewed and increased by 2%. This was below the 
average level of increases for other employees. 
The policy allows exceptions where a higher increase is justified 
by particular circumstances. In line with this, Peter Emery’s salary 
was increased by 5% to reflect the increasing scope of his 
Group-wide role. 
Assessment of performance-related remuneration relating 
to 2015
There is a detailed review of performance against scorecard 
measures on page 85.
Financial performance was adversely affected by loss of Levy 
Exemption Certificate revenue and by further weakening in the 
commodity markets. Performance against quantitative measures 
which management can control has been generally good.
Remuneration Committee report
The management team, and indeed the 
staff as a whole, have continued to pursue 
resolutely the Company’s biomass 
conversion strategy and to operate our 
three separate businesses well.
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
– 
recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and 
framework for the executive directors and members of the 
Executive Committee; 
– 
determining, within that framework, the individual 
remuneration packages for the executive directors and 
members of the Executive Committee; 
– 
approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive 
arrangements for executive directors and senior managers, 
including agreeing the annual targets and payments under 
such arrangements; 
– 
determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions 
of service and the specific terms for any individual within 
the Committee’s remit, either on recruitment or on 
termination; 
– 
determining the policy for, and scope of, executive pension 
arrangements; and 
– 
to oversee any major changes in employee benefit 
structures throughout the Group and review remuneration 
trends across the Group.

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Strong safety performance is noteworthy given the large planned 
maintenance schedule at Drax Power and the first year of 
commercial operation at Drax Biomass. Although forced outage 
rates at Drax were higher than originally forecast this was largely 
because of the changes to the operating regime adopted in the 
lower margin environment. Drax Biomass made steady progress 
although it was hampered by adverse weather conditions in the 
southern United States.
Strong sustainability performance in the biomass supply chain is 
critical to the Group’s strategy. We were therefore pleased at 
progress on certification processes and that there were no 
material audit discrepancies.
It has been a particularly difficult year in political and regulatory 
matters. The UK government’s change of policy on exempting 
renewable energy from the CCL affected revenues at both Drax 
Power and Haven Power. In addition, one of the Scorecard 
measures was regulatory progress, including the outcome of the 
process to complete the award of the investment CfD allocated to 
one of Drax’s generating units as part of the government’s energy 
market reform measures. The European Commission confirmed in 
January 2016 that the State Aid application would be referred to a 
Phase 2 investigation. A score of zero has been attributed to this 
regulatory progress measure. 
Components within the Scorecard can be scored between zero 
and 2.0. A score of 1.0 represents an on-target performance and 
the overall score in any year is capped at 1.5. For 2015 we 
assessed the overall performance score at 0.76.
The Board has a discretion to adjust the performance score in 
light of matters not reflected in the Scorecard. The Committee 
agreed that the score was a reasonable reflection of the 
Company’s performance and we decided not to make a 
discretionary adjustment.
In considering directors’ personal performance against 
objectives, we agreed that there were no individual circumstances 
of exceptional over or under performance, and that the usual 
policy approach of a single score was fair.
The directors’ performance score can be between zero and 1.5 and 
in 2015 it was assessed at 1.2.
The Committee’s application of the Scorecard and personal 
performance assessment resulted in annual bonus payments to 
executive directors of approximately 91.2% of target, or 45.6% 
of maximum.
Vesting of 2013 Bonus Matching Plan awards 
The Committee has also considered the vesting of the Bonus 
Matching Plan (BMP) awards made in 2013, which were conditional 
upon performance over the three years from the start of 2013 to 
the end of 2015. The awards are 50% based on the Company’s 
relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance and 50% 
on the three-year average of the Balanced Corporate Scorecard. 
The Company’s TSR over the period was below the median of the 
comparator group, and the Committee therefore confirmed that 
none of the TSR element of the award would vest. The Balanced 
average scorecard score over the same period was 1.17.
The Committee has a discretion to adjust the average to reflect 
achievement of strategic objectives over the three-year period. 
We considered this and decided not to exercise discretion to adjust 
the average score. The Committee determined that 43.33% of the 
Scorecard award element would vest. Therefore, based on the 
performance measures, the Committee determined that 21.66% of 
the executive directors’ 2013 BMP awards will vest at or shortly after 
the third anniversary of their date of grant.
Board changes
The Committee also needed to consider remuneration matters 
arising from the appointments of Will Gardiner and Andy Koss, and 
the departures from the Board of Charles Berry, Peter Emery, Tony 
Quinlan and Paul Taylor.
Will Gardiner’s remuneration is in line with the remuneration policy 
at an annual base salary of £390,000. The Committee considers 
that this is at the appropriate market level. Andy Koss has been 
appointed as a director with effect from 1 January 2016. The 
Committee determined his salary at £310,000, which we assessed 
to be below the market level, which is appropriate as this is Andy’s 
first appointment at Board level.
Details of all payments made to directors who left the Board during 
2015 have been included on the Company’s website, and are 
disclosed in the later sections of this report.
No termination payments were made to Charles Berry or Tony 
Quinlan, although the Committee did exercise its discretion in 
favour of Tony Quinlan to allow the vesting of his deferred bonus 
awards on a pro-rata basis.
Peter Emery left the Company on 31 December 2015 having 
completed the process of implementation of Group-wide 
operational standards across the different businesses under 
the new management structure. The Committee reviewed and 
approved payments to be made to him in accordance with his 
service agreement. The Company elected to make a payment in lieu 
of notice, which will be phased, giving the Company the opportunity 
to offset future earnings. As the termination of his service followed 
from the Company’s management reorganisation, the Committee 
agreed that he should be treated as a “good leaver” under the BMP.
Paul Taylor has relinquished his role as Retail and Trading Director 
but he remains with the Company in a part-time role. Awards 
previously made to him under the BMP will vest, or not as the case 
may be, subject to achievement of the conditions and at their 
normal vesting dates. 
2016 targets and long-term incentives
The Committee also considered targets for 2016. These have 
been established to be at least as challenging as those for 2015. 
A description of the 2016 corporate targets is set out on page 92, 
with such detail as can be provided whilst safeguarding 
commercial confidentiality.
The Committee also agreed to the grant of 2016 BMP awards to 
the executive directors to the value of 150% of their 2015 annual 
bonus, and subject to the same performance conditions as 
described in the policy section of this report.

Directors’ remuneration policy
This remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (AGM). It became effective from 
immediately after the AGM on 23 April 2014 and binding upon the Group until the close of the 2017 AGM. There are no planned changes 
to the policy over the three-year period to which it relates.
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to:
– 
give effect to existing remuneration commitments in accordance with directors’ contracts of employment; 
– 
pay market rates of total remuneration; 
– 
ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward; 
– 
award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of strategic 
objectives and personal performance; 
– 
ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan strategic objectives; 
– 
ensure that payments on termination of employment are linked to performance and the exercise of good faith; and 
– 
allow the Committee an element of discretion to enable recruitment or termination situations to be managed in the best interests of 
the Group.
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations in 2013 (the Regulations) and the provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
SECTION 1
Key components of remuneration
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to support the delivery of business performance and creation of 
shareholder value. We set out in the table below the remuneration policy, and in the notes following the table we provide a commentary 
on differences between this policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally.
The following table sets out the policy relating to the key components of executive director remuneration:
Remuneration 
component 
How this component relates 
to Group strategy
How this component
operates in practice 
Performance measures 
and maximum potential value
i) Base salary
Base salary helps to attract, reward and 
retain the right calibre of executive to 
deliver the leadership/management 
needed to execute the Group’s vision and 
business plan. 
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills 
and experience, and market level.
To determine market level, the Committee reviews 
remuneration data on executive positions at 
companies which the Committee considers to be 
appropriate comparators.
The comparator companies are selected, with 
advice from the Committee’s remuneration 
advisers, taking into account relevant comparator 
factors such as, but not limited to, sector, size, and 
international presence.
On appointment, an executive director’s base salary 
is set at the market level, or below if the executive is 
not fully experienced at this level.
Where base salary on appointment is below market 
level to reflect experience, it will over time, be 
increased to align with the market level, subject to 
performance.
Base salaries of all executive directors are generally 
reviewed once each year.
Reviews cover: individual performance; experience; 
development in role; and market comparisons.
The base salaries of executive directors in 
post at the start of the policy period and 
who remain in the same role throughout the 
policy period will not usually be increased by 
a higher percentage than the average annual 
percentage increase in salaries of all other 
employees in the Group.
The only exceptions are where:
(i) an executive director has been appointed 
at below market level to reflect 
experience. In this case, the maximum 
annual increase to base salary will be 5% 
over the normal maximum; or
(ii)  there is a particular reason for a higher 
increase, such as a change in the scope or 
nature of responsibilities.
In the case of the Production Director and 
the Retail and Trading Director, some further 
adjustment is envisaged to reflect increasing 
scope of roles and increasing experience. The 
maximum increase to base salary in any year 
will be 5% over the normal maximum.

Performance measures 
and maximum potential value
ii) Annual bonus
The award of annual bonuses is directly 
linked to personal performance and to 
the achievement of the annual Business 
Plan targets. 
The multiplicative formula is designed 
to ensure that bonus payments for high 
personal performance are moderated 
where business performance is below 
target, or vice versa.
Clawback
The Committee may require a director 
to repay to the Company such amount 
of any annual bonus payment as it 
considers appropriate in circumstances 
of financial misstatement, misconduct or 
if assessment of a performance condition 
is found to have been based on an error, 
inaccuracy or misleading information, 
or in other circumstances that the 
Committee considers to justify the 
operation of the clawback provision.
In these circumstances, Bonus Matching 
Plan (BMP) clawback provisions may also 
apply (see BMP below).
Strategic and Business plan targets are set by the 
Board as part of the Business Plan approval process.
The Committee determines Group performance 
measures using a Scorecard.
The Scorecard shows executive directors’ annual 
targets and measures of performance (low, target 
and stretch), and weightings.
Score is zero if performance is below the low 
measure.
Maximum score is attributed to the stretch measure.
The Scorecard is amended each year in line with 
business strategy and objectives.
Summary Scorecard and performance results are 
published in the Annual report on remuneration.
To determine the actual bonus awards, the 
following formula is used:
Chief Executive’s bonus
Target bonus is 75% of base salary
Actual bonus = basic salary x 75% x company 
score x personal score
Bonus is capped at 150% of salary
Other directors’ bonus
Target bonus is 70% of salary
Bonus = basic salary x 70% x company score x 
personal score
Bonus is capped at 140% of salary

Maximum 
bonus potential 
(% of base salary)
Chief Executive
150%
Finance Director
140%
Production Director
140%
Retail and Trading Director
140%
Group performance measures
Group performance measures include 
financial, production, strategic and other 
Business Plan objectives.
These measures and weightings are 
determined by the Board and adopted by the 
Committee.
Individual performance measures
The Remuneration Committee determines 
the personal objectives for the Chief 
Executive. The Chief Executive proposes 
personal objectives for the other executive 
directors, which are reviewed and approved 
by the Remuneration Committee. Generally, 
all executive directors will be awarded 
a single score based on their collective 
performance in providing effective day-
to-day leadership of the Group as a unified 
leadership team. Personal scores may differ 
in circumstances of exceptional over or under 
performance.
iii) Deferred annual 
bonus 
This is the deferred portion of annual 
bonus. The aim of deferral is to further 
align executives to the interests of 
shareholders, by linking share-based 
reward to long-term sustainable 
performance. 
35% of any annual bonus is settled in shares 
deferred for three years. No performance 
conditions are used other than continued service.
If the executive leaves the Group before the normal 
vesting day, the shares will vest (pro rated to the 
date of leaving) only if the termination is for a 
specified reason including redundancy, retirement 
or death in service, or, if for any other reason, at 
the discretion of the Committee. In any other 
circumstances the award is forfeited.
100% of the shares will vest subject to 
continued employment up to the date 
of vesting.

Performance measures

iv) Bonus Matching 
Plan (BMP)
This is the long-term incentive plan 
for executives.
It links long-term share-based incentives 
to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and 
to the achievement of Business Plan 
strategic targets.
The Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) is a long-term 
performance share plan.
Under the BMP, executive directors receive an 
annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up 
to 1.5 times the amount of the executive’s annual 
bonus for the prior year.
It is the Committee’s policy to grant BMP awards to 
executive directors at 1.5 times the amount of the 
annual bonus unless the performance of the director 
or of the business makes an award at that level 
inappropriate. No payment is made for the shares.
Vesting is conditional upon service and 
performance conditions, and shares vest on 
the third anniversary of the grant subject to 
the achievement of performance conditions 
determined by the Committee. To the extent that 
vesting is determined by reference to Company 
Scorecard performance, at the end of the three-
year performance period, the Committee will review 
each of the annual results going into an average 
Scorecard calculation and has the discretion to 
adjust the final outcome based on events over the 
period to ensure that the result is consistent with 
the underlying performance progression of the 
business. In exercising its discretion the Committee 
will have particular regard to progress against the 
strategic objectives incorporated in the Scorecard.
If the executive leaves the Group before the normal 
vesting day, the shares will vest (pro rated to the 
date of leaving and phased over the normal cycle 
of the performance periods) only if the termination 
is for a specified reason including redundancy, 
retirement or death in service, or, if for any other 
reason, at the discretion of the Committee. In any 
other circumstances the award is forfeited.
Performance condition override
The Committee will include an override provision 
in each grant under the BMP. This will give the 
Committee discretion to determine that no vesting 
shall occur or vesting shall be reduced if there are 
circumstances (relating to the Company’s overall 
performance or otherwise) which make vesting 
as calculated by reference to the performance 
conditions alone inappropriate.
Clawback
If a repayment of bonus is required (see “annual 
bonus” above) the Committee shall also make an 
appropriate reduction in the number of shares that 
may vest under the BMP (in respect of an award 
made pursuant to the annual bonus payment 
subject to the clawback).
The Committee may also reduce the number 
of shares under a BMP award in circumstances 
of financial misstatement, or if assessment of a 
performance condition is found to have been based 
on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information, or 
in other circumstances that the Committee considers 
to justify the operation of the clawback provision.
Maximum number of shares granted equals 
shares to the value of 1.5 times annual bonus 
for prior year.
Maximum vesting of shares three years later 
is subject to performance.
There are two vesting performance measures 
(vesting threshold is 15% in both measures):
i) 
up to 50% of shares vest subject to TSR 
performance over three years relative to 
FTSE 51–150 as follows: 
Below median = 0% vesting
At median = 15% vesting (threshold)
Upper quartile = 100% vesting.
ii)  up to 50% of shares vest subject to 
Company Scorecard performance 
averaged over the three-year 
performance period, as follows:
Score <1 = 0% vesting
Score 1 = 15% vesting (threshold score)
Score 1.5 = 100% vesting
The three-year average Company 
performance score is capped at 1.5.
Example:
Year 1 Score 1.8
Year 2 Score 1.4
Year 3 score 1.4
Three-year BMP performance score = 1.5
For both the TSR and Scorecard conditions 
vesting between 15% and 100% is on a 
straight-line interpolation.
In accordance with the rules of the BMP, 
Dividend Shares are awarded at the time 
and in the event that shares vest. They 
are calculated based on the dividends 
paid following the initial award until the 
award vests.
v) Pension
Pension provision is one of the 
components to attract, reward and retain 
the right calibre of executive in order to 
ensure delivery of the leadership and 
management needed to execute the 
Group’s vision and Business Plan. 
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory 
membership of the Group’s defined contribution 
pension plan. The employer’s contribution for 
executive directors is 20% of base salary.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may 
either have contributions of the same amounts made 
to their personal pension schemes or cash in lieu 
of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal 
statutory deductions; or a combination of pension 
contributions up to the HMRC Annual Allowance 
with the remainder as cash in lieu of pension.
Maximum is 20% of base salary.

Performance measures 
and maximum potential value
vi) Other benefits 
In general, other benefits aim to align 
directors’ total remuneration broadly 
with the market. 
In particular, all employee share 
plans incentivise sustained long-term 
performance and strengthen teamwork 
by enabling all employees to share in the 
success of the business. The plans are 
vehicles for aligning staff remuneration 
with TSR performance.
Executive directors receive a car allowance, life 
assurance (four times salary), the opportunity to 
participate in all-employee share plans on the same 
basis as other employees, annual private health 
assessment and annual private medical cover. 
Relocation expenses and/or second base expenses 
are paid where appropriate in individual cases. 
Directors’ relocation expenses are determined on a 
case-by-case basis. The policy is designed to assist 
the director to relocate to a home of similar standing.
vii) Share ownership 
The Group’s share ownership guidelines 
align the interests of executives with 
shareholders.
The share ownership guideline is that the Chief 
Executive should retain shares to the value of 175% 
of base salary and other directors should retain 
shares to the value of 125% of base salary. Until this 
level is reached, directors who receive shares by 
virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred 
bonus shares must retain 50% of the shares 
received net (i.e. after income tax and national 
insurance contributions). Only shares that have 
actually vested count towards the threshold.
Differences between the policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally
The following differences apply between the remuneration of directors and the policy on the remuneration of employees generally:
– 
executive directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for BMP. However, there are differences in terms of levels of grant; 
– 
annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, and the requirement to defer a portion of annual bonus applies only to 
executive directors;
– 
employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus subject to Company performance and 
continued employment, whereas directors and all other UK-based employees participate in a discretionary bonus scheme; and
– 
hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments.
Non-executive directors
Remuneration component
How this component operates in practice
Annual fee
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined by 
the Chairman and the executive directors. These are determined in the light of:
– 
fees of chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed companies selected for comparator purposes on the same basis as 
for executive directors;
– 
the responsibilities and time commitment; and
– 
the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience.
The Chairman receives an annual fee.
Non-executive directors receive an annual base fee.
Additional annual fees are paid:
– 
to the Senior Independent Director (which includes the fee for chairing a Board Committee other than the Audit Committee);
– 
to the Chair of the Audit Committee;
– 
to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee; and
– 
to the Chair of any other Committee (this is not paid to the Chairman of the Nominations Committee if he or she is also the 
Chairman of the Board).
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed periodically against market comparators. They were last reviewed in 2014. Current fee 
levels are shown in the annual report on remuneration.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any performance related remuneration arrangements.
Travel expenses
Reimbursement of reasonable travel and accommodation expenses as applicable.
Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus, pension or any of the 
share-based reward plans. The Chairman’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of 
one month.

SECTION 2
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will apply the core principles on page 77 and the 
remuneration components set out in the table on pages 77 to 80 
to determine the remuneration of newly appointed directors. Base 
salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the 
experience of the director being appointed. Where this is below 
the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the 
market level, subject to good performance. In relation to directors 
appointed from outside the Company, where the Committee 
considers it to be necessary to secure the appointment of the 
director, the Committee may:
– 
pay “sign-on” compensation for loss of benefits on resignation 
from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share 
incentives (subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect 
performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the right of 
the Company to clawback any amount which is subsequently 
paid to the executive by the former employer, and to clawback 
an appropriate proportion of the payment if the executive 
leaves soon after appointment); and
– 
make appropriate payments in circumstances where a director 
is relocated from outside the UK.
SECTION 3
Service agreements
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite 
duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 
12 months’ prior notice.
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements the 
Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of 
termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and 
benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during 
the contractual notice period.
SECTION 4
Remuneration scenarios
The composition and value of the executive directors’ 
remuneration packages at below threshold, target and 
outperformance scenarios under the Drax Group remuneration 
policy are set out in the charts below:

Remuneration Committee report continued
SECTION 5
Policy on loss of office
If an executive director’s employment is brought to an end by either 
party and if it is necessary to determine a termination payment, the 
Committee’s policy, in the absence of a breach of the service 
agreement by the director, is to determine a director’s termination 
payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The 
termination payment will be calculated based on the value of base 
salary and contractual benefits that would have accrued to the 
director during the contractual notice period. The Committee will 
seek mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment 
to a leaving director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the 
circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may, for 
example, be appropriate to consider mitigation if the director has 
secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would not be 
applicable retrospectively to a contractual payment in lieu of notice. 
In addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect 
of his/her statutory rights. No service agreement includes any 
provision for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any 
compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be 
determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
All bonus payments are discretionary benefits. The Committee 
will consider whether a departing director should receive an annual 
bonus in respect of the financial year in which, and/or immediately 
preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated to reflect the 
period of the performance year completed at the date of 
termination. The Committee will take into account performance; 
co-operation with succession; and any breach of goodwill and 
adherence to contractual obligations/restrictions. If the termination 
is by the Company on less than the specified notice in the director’s 
service agreement, the Committee will also consider whether the 
director should receive an annual bonus in respect of any period of 
the financial year following termination for which the director has 
been deprived of the opportunity to earn annual bonus. If the 
employment ends in any of the following circumstances, the director 
will be treated as a “good leaver” and the director will be eligible for a 
bonus payment:
– 
redundancy;
– 
retirement;
– 
ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company; 
and
– 
death.
If the termination is for any other reason a bonus payment will be 
at the discretion of the Committee. It is the Committee’s policy to 
ensure that any such bonus payment properly reflects the departing 
director’s performance and behaviour towards the Company. 
Therefore the amount of any such payment will be determined 
as described in the table on page 78, taking into account (i) the 
director’s personal performance and behaviour towards the 
Company and (ii) the Group performance. If a bonus payment is 
made, it will normally be paid as soon as is reasonably practicable 
after the Group performance element has been determined for 
the relevant period. There may be circumstances in which the 
Committee considers it appropriate for the bonus payment to be 
made earlier, for example, on termination due to ill-health, in which 
case, on-target Group performance score shall be assumed.
No element of any such bonus payment shall be deferred. 
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and 
conditional share awards held by the director under the BMP 
should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee will be in 
accordance with the rules of the BMP (as approved by shareholders). 
In summary, the rules of the BMP provide that awards will vest 
(pro-rated to the date of employment termination) if employment 
ends for any of the following reasons:
– 
redundancy; 
– 
retirement; 
– 
ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company; 
– 
change of ownership; and 
– 
death.
If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the BMP 
require the Committee to exercise its discretion. In doing so it 
will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular the 
performance of the Company; the director’s performance and 
behaviour towards the Company during the performance cycle 
of the relevant awards; as well as a range of other relevant factors, 
including the proximity of the award to its maturity date. The rules 
of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, 
deferred bonus shares vest as soon as reasonably practicable 
following termination. Awards, which vest subject to satisfaction 
of the relevant performance conditions, will be (time) pro-rated 
and will be phased over the performance cycle of the 
relevant awards.
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any 
benefits accruing to a leaving director is fair and appropriate taking 
account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances 
in which the Committee may be minded to award an annual bonus 
payment and/or permit the vesting of BMP awards include: 
– 
the director’s continued good performance up to and following 
the giving of notice; and 
– 
the director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/
her departure and handover arrangements.
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such 
payments if the reason for the departure is:
– 
poor performance; or 
– 
the director does not continue to perform effectively following 
notice; or 
– 
the director is departing to join a competitor.
SECTION 6
Context
Wider employee population
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes 
into account the level of general pay increases within the Group.
It is the Committee’s policy that annual salary increases for 
executive directors should not exceed the average annual salary 
increase for the wider employee population unless there is a 
particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the 
nature or scope of responsibilities.

Views taken from the employee population
In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, 
the Group discusses executive remuneration policy and provides 
details of the process by which the Committee establishes 
executive remuneration packages. The information provided 
includes details of the benchmarking of executive director 
remuneration as well as information benchmarking the pay of 
employees in the collective bargaining unit with pay elsewhere 
in the industry.
Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on 
environmental, social and governance issues when setting the 
remuneration of executive directors. Specific measures can be 
included in the balanced Corporate Scorecard. The Committee 
is able to consider those issues in considering whether to exercise 
its discretion to adjust the overall score, and in considering the 
performance conditions override under the BMP, as described 
on page 79.
Shareholder engagement
The Company holds regular meetings with its largest shareholders, 
and the Committee takes into account any views or representations 
of shareholders relating to executive remuneration. The Company 
has consulted its 10 largest shareholders in relation to the 
formulation of its directors’ remuneration policy.

Notes:
(1) Calculated using underlying earnings, being profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the post-tax effect of unrealised gains on derivative contracts 
and asset obsolescence charges and the one-off settlement of CESP in 2014 (see note 2.6 to the consolidated financial statements). 
(2) End year performance, target set at level commensurate with achieving both early end of construction and ahead of schedule ramp up to full capacity.
(3) Biomass performance, supply and development targets, and retail value added Business Plan are not disclosed because they are commercially confidential and disclosure may 
prejudice ongoing and future commercial negotiations. 
Following this process, and based on the relative weightings and scores as set out in the table, the Committee assessed the corporate 
score for 2015 at 0.76. The Committee did not exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score.
Personal performance
The 2015 personal performance of the members of the Executive Committee, including the executive directors, was assessed relative 
to their individual performance in driving the performance of the business across the corporate scorecard categories. Key factors in 
the assessments were each individual’s contribution to delivering the Group’s strategy in the context of the Group’s vision and values. 
In the view of the Remuneration Committee each of the members of the Executive Committee made a strong contribution in their 
specific areas of responsibility. This was notable both for those responsible for the operational business and those responsible for 
Group service functions.
The Remuneration Committee also assessed the performance of the Executive Committee as a team. It noted that there are a number of 
important areas where the team had made very good progress with self-help measures to mitigate the impact of the challenges from the 
severe weakening of the commodity markets and changes to regulation. These often entailed close co-operation between teams and 
businesses in different parts of the Group.

Remuneration Committee report continued
The Remuneration Committee concluded that, in light of the effective performance of the Executive Committee members as a team, it 
was appropriate to give the same personal performance score for all team members. A score of 1.2 was awarded representing a strong 
performance at an individual and team level.

Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited information)
During the year, the shareholding guidelines required executive directors who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who 
receive deferred bonus shares to retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and National Insurance Contributions) until 
the value was equal to at least 175% and 125% of salary respectively for the Chief Executive and other executive directors. Only shares 
that have actually vested count towards the threshold.
In March 2015, immediately post the vesting of the 2012 BMP Awards, the shareholding guidelines were fully met to the extent that the 
value of the Chief Executive’s shareholding was 207% of salary and each of the other executive directors held between 112% and 131% of 
salary. The following table shows the executive directors’ shareholdings and share interests at 31 December 2015.

Value of £100 invested
The following graph shows how the value of £100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2008 has changed and compares that 
performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices. These 
indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Company’s shareholders may judge their relative returns 
given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices. The graph reflects the TSR 
(determined according to usual market practice) for the Company and each of the indices referred to on a cumulative basis over the 
period from 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2015.

Adviser to the Committee
The adviser to the Committee for the year was 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). PwC is an independent 
adviser appointed by the Committee in October 2010, following 
a competitive tender process, to advise on market practice and 
remuneration of executive and non-executive directors.
From time to time the Group engages PwC to provide financial, 
taxation and related advice on specific matters. The Committee 
will continue to monitor such engagements in order to be satisfied 
that they do not affect PwC’s independence as an adviser to 
the Committee.
PwC was paid £44,000 during 2015 in respect of advice given to 
the Committee.
In the second half of 2015, the Committee undertook a review of 
the remuneration adviser. Members of the Committee, assisted by 
the Head of Human Resources, received presentations from three 
shortlisted firms and assessed them against objective criteria 
including their knowledge and experience of the market and the 
sector. PwC was reappointed as adviser to the Committee. 
The Committee also considers the views of the Group Chief 
Executive regarding the performance and remuneration of the 
other executive directors and senior staff.
The Committee is also advised by Philip Hudson, the Group 
Company Secretary, and by Richard Neville, the Head of 
Human Resources.

Directors’ report continued
Transfer of shares – provides detail of how transfers of shares in 
certified and uncertified form may be undertaken. It also sets out 
the rights of refusal of directors to effect a transfer and the action 
that directors must take following such refusal. It should be noted 
that a shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the 
Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a 
transfer of shares to take place.
Voting and deadlines for exercising voting rights – these sections of 
the Articles deal with voting on a show of hands and on a poll. They 
also cover the appointment of a proxy or corporate representative. 
In respect of voting deadlines, the Articles provide for the submission 
of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed 
for the holding of the meeting. It has been the Company’s practice 
since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual 
General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings.
A trustee holds shares on behalf of employees in respect of the 
Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights attached to such 
shares are not directly exercisable by the employees. The employee 
may direct the trustee on how to vote at a General Meeting and the 
trustee may only cast its vote in respect of shares over which it has 
received a valid direction from employees.
Changes to the Articles – the Articles may only be changed by 
shareholders by special resolution.

Auditors and the disclosure of information to 
the auditor
So far as each person serving as a director at the date of approving 
this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being 
information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing 
the report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made enquiries 
of fellow directors, each director has taken all steps that he/she 
ought to have taken as a director to ascertain any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that 
information. This information is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act.
Resolutions will be proposed at the AGM for (i) the reappointment 
of Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group; and (ii) authorising the 
directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration. The Audit 
Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, the auditor’s 
effectiveness and relationship with the Group, including the level 
of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Further details on 
the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the 
Audit Committee report on pages 70 to 74.

relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the

and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and 
– 
the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the

Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of 
directors on 22 February 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:
Dorothy Thompson CBE
Chief Executive 
Will Gardiner
Chief Financial Officer
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), set out in FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”. Under Company law the directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
– 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
– 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
– 
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and 
– 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
– 
properly select and apply accounting policies; 
– 
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
– 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
– 
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks 
that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained on page 104 to the financial 
statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term 
viability of the group contained within the strategic report on 
pages 50 and 51.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
– 
 the directors’ confirmation on page 53 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
– 
 the disclosures on pages 54, 55 that describe those risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
– 
 the directors’ statement on page 104 to the financial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements;
– 
 the director’s explanation 50, 51 as to how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so 
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that 
we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We 
also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.

Risk
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Asset impairment 
On 1 August 2015, the UK government announced the withdrawal 
of support under the CCL resulting in a significant loss of income 
and a reduction in market value, below the net asset value. 
Earnings have also been impacted by low market prices resulting 
in reductions in underlying profits. Management has therefore 
performed an impairment review in the current year.
As noted in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions in note 2.3 and the Audit Committee 
report on page 72, asset impairment has been considered a 
key risk.
The impairment testing is subject to the application of 
management judgement in identifying Cash Generating Units 
(CGUs) and various assumptions underlying the calculation of 
value in use for each CGU identified. These assumptions include 
the achievability of the long term business plan and related 
modelling assumptions underlying the valuation process.
We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key 
controls related to asset impairment. 
The significant judgements have been disclosed by management 
in note 2.3 and include:
– 
The award of a CfD for the third biomass unit with an 
assumed price of £100/MWh;
– 
Some form of support in place after the current ROC regime 
ends in 2027 with a value to incentivise profitable generation; 
– 
Forecast biomass prices in the long term, given that biomass 
is not a standardised commodity traded openly on exchanges.
We utilised our valuation specialists to benchmark key market 
related assumptions including commodity prices, current and 
future government support mechanisms and discount rates 
against external data where available. For example, we have 
compared the estimated strike price of £100/MWh assumed by 
management to the EC approved strike price of £105/MWh for 
the conversion of Lynemouth power station in December 2015.
We have considered the expected government support that 
biomass could receive after the end of the current ROC regime 
in 2027 relative to other renewable technologies to determine 
whether management’s assumptions are reasonable.
We have considered the liquidity of the biomass market and 
the impact that Drax could have on that market relating to the 
volumes of biomass required in the future.
We have also challenged the underlying assumptions and 
significant judgements used in management’s impairment 
model by:
– 
Running a range of sensitivities to assess whether an 
impairment would be required if a range of more conservative 
assumptions were adopted. 
– 
Assessing the historical accuracy of management’s budgets 
and forecasts by comparing them to actual performance and 
verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models.
– 
Assessing whether the disclosures in note 2.3 of the financial 
statements appropriately disclose the key judgements taken 
so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact of 
the financial statement of changes to key assumptions that 
may lead to impairment. 
Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts 
Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the 
income statement are £123.7 million (2014: £65.8 million), with 
derivative financial statement assets of £330.8 million (2014: 
£139.1 million) and derivative financial statement liabilities of 
£274.3 million (2014 £130.7 million) on the balance sheet.
The valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is 
complex and requires judgement in areas such as estimates of 
future prices, market movements, and assumptions of credit risk.
The accounting standards governing the availability and 
application of hedge accounting are complex, and require 
judgement in their applications.
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s 
critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in 
section 7 and the Audit Committee report on page 72.
We carried out testing of the design and implementation of 
key controls related to the valuation of commodity and foreign 
exchange contracts. 
We used our financial instruments specialists to test 
management’s key judgements and calculations, including 
testing a sample of trades undertaken to supporting trade tickets 
confirming key information such as volumes and market price. 
We challenged the assumptions involved in determining 
valuation, hedge effectiveness and credit risk, including analysis 
of the forward price curves used and hedge effectiveness 
documentation maintained.

Risk
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Valuation of biomass and coal stocks 
Biomass stocks of £119 million and coal stocks of £89 million 
(2014: £81 million and £145 million respectively) are held on 
the balance sheet at year end. The valuation of biomass and 
coal stocks is dependent upon the estimation or measurement 
respectively of the tonnage held, the calorific value, its purchase 
price and its net realisable value. The weighted average cost 
calculation is complex for both coal and biomass and this results 
in increasing risk of management error or bias and therefore an 
increased risk of material misstatement. Further details of the 
key accounting policy judgements are included in note 3.3.
We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key 
controls related to the valuation of biomass and coal stocks. 
Our audit procedures include testing the underlying weighted 
average cost calculation for both coal and biomass to source 
data such as purchase invoice for amounts delivered in the year. 
Our procedures also included sample testing of the calorific value 
to third party laboratory reports or purchase invoice.
We evaluated the results of external surveys completed on the 
coal pile at the year end and attended the survey to assess the 
controls over the accuracy of the survey. We assessed biomass 
deliveries and usage associated with the calculation of biomass 
volumes held at the year end.
On a sample basis we also requested and received external stock 
confirmation for stocks held off site and agreed these to the 
underlying records.
Valuation and recoverability of ROCs
£266 million of ROCs are held on the balance sheet at the year 
end (2014: £174 million). ROCs are recognised as they are earned 
through generating electricity from burning biomass. They are 
initially recognised at fair value (reducing the cost of biomass 
in the income statement) and subsequently written down to 
the net realisable value as appropriate. Judgement is required 
from management in estimating both the initial fair value 
and estimated net realisable value, including the value of any 
recycling fund element. Further detail is explained in the Group’s 
critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in 
note 3.2 and the Audit Committee report on page 72.
We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key 
controls related to the valuation and recoverability of ROCs. 
We gained assurance over the ROCs generated in the year by 
agreement to Ofgem confirmation certificates and available 
burn data.
We have assessed the initial fair value of ROCs by agreement of 
the buy-out price to available third party supporting information 
and external sales agreements. 
We have also challenged the estimation by management 
of the recycling fund element which impacts the estimated 
net realisable value of the ROCs held in the balance sheet at 
year end. This included comparison to other available third 
party estimates.
102
Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Last year our report included one risk which is not included this year 
relating to the useful economic life and carrying value of property, 
plant and equipment. This risk has been considered as part of our 
asset impairment work by considering the consistency of asset 
impairment assumptions with estimated useful economic lives. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction 
with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 72.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement 
in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of our work.
When determining materiality, we considered the decline 
in earnings this year and at present do not consider that this 
decline is likely to reflect a long-term reduction in the size 
and scale of the business.
We therefore determined materiality by considering a range of 
possible benchmarks and the figures derived from those, then 
selecting a materiality within that range that we considered 
appropriate. We determined materiality for the Group on a 
blended basis to be £6.1 million (2014: £6.1 million). 
This materiality equates to 0.4% of net assets and 13.3% of 
underlying profit before tax, before unrealised gains or losses 
on derivative contracts and one-off asset obsolescence charges. 
Last year we used a benchmark of 5% of underlying profit before 
tax, before unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts and 
the one-off CESP settlement.
In determining materiality at £6.1 million, we concluded that as 
the scale of the business has not changed, we would apply 
an appropriately conservative approach and ensure that 
materiality did not exceed the materiality set in the prior year.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.1 million (2014: 
£0.1 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We 
define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work.
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Drax Group plc
continued
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at three locations (2014: the same 
three locations), being Drax Power, Haven Power and Drax 
Biomass. All of these were subject to a full audit. These three 
locations represent the principal business units and account for all 
of the group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. They were 
also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified 
above. Our audit work at the 3 locations was executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower 
than group materiality and ranged from £3.0 million to £4.8 million 
(2014: £2.9 million to £5.5 million). 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process 
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components 
not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits each of the locations where the group audit scope was 
focused at least once every two years and the most significant 
locations several times a year. During 2015, the senior statutory 
auditor visited each significant location.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
– 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
– 
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
– 
we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
– 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
– 
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in 
our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.

Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
annual report is:
– 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
– 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
– 
otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual 
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated 
to the audit committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our 
audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality 
controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Financial statements
Introduction
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information 
about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement), 
financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows 
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the 
Company) together with all of the entities controlled by 
the Company (collectively, the Group). 
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information 
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated 
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes 
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the 
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is 
required by law, IFRS or other regulations to facilitate increased 
understanding of the primary statements set out on pages 107 to 111.
Where relevant, we have set out key elements of our business model 
(see pages 16 to 19) and how this has affected our financial results.
This year we have changed the way our financial statements 
and the associated notes are presented. The notes are grouped 
by function together, with related information, including 
accounting policies, areas involving significant judgement 
and related explanations.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have 
been measured at fair value.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments 
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash 
flows, are set out within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 55 
of this document.
In the viability statement on page 50 the Directors state that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the next three years.
Consequently, the Directors also have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months 
and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by 
the Company, (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each 
year. The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.
The impact of all intra-Group transactions is eliminated 
on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included 
in the consolidated income statement from the date the Group 
gained control.
Accounting policies
Those accounting policies that are material to our financial 
statements are described in note 8.3 to the financial statements 
or, where specific to an individual component of the financial 
statements, in the relevant note (see contents on page 106).
We have not changed any of our accounting policies in the period. 
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and 
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial 
statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of these 
new requirements has not had a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Judgements, estimates and uncertainties
The preparation of financial statements requires management to 
exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It 
also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity 
are set out below and in more detail in the related notes. 
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome 
that differs from the amount recognised in the financial 
statements are as follows:
Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. 
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future 
replacement cycles and other available evidence, however, 
a degree of judgement is required.

Annual report and accounts 2015

Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually 
for goodwill and for other assets where an indicator of possible 
impairment exists. The assessment of future cash flows that 
underpins such a review is based up management’s best estimate 
of future prices, volumes and economic conditions. The calculations 
are particularly sensitive to judgement given the long time period 
covered by the assessment.
 More information: note 2.3 on page 114
Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the 
Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value 
depends upon assuming a market price for the instrument in 
question. The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon 
forward curves that are largely derived from readily attainable 
quotations and third party sources. However, any forward curve is 
based at least in part upon assumptions around future transactions 
and market movements. Where such instruments extend beyond 
the liquid portion of the forward curve, the level of judgement 
increases as the number of observable transactions decreases.
 More information: note 7.2 on page 138
Inventories – fuel inventories are valued at weighted average 
cost based on purchase price, or net realisable value where lower. 
Valuation is largely based on observable data (such as invoiced 
costs and automated weigher readings). However, given the bulk 
nature of fuels an element of judgement is required to assess the 
volume of stock held at the balance sheet date.
 More information: note 3.3 on page 123
ROCs – the carrying amount of ROCs in the Group’s balance sheet 
are stated at their expected realisable value. This assessment is 
based on an estimated future sales price.
 More information: note 3.2 on page 122
Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Pensions – the Group records a liability in its balance sheet for its 
obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined benefit 
pension scheme less the fair value of assets held by the pension 
scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities 
is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding 
interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, 
mortality and other factors.
 More information: note 6.3 on page 131
Taxation – in accounting for tax liabilities the Group makes 
assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of income 
and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are based 
on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required, 
consultation with external advisors.
 More information: note 2.5 on page 116
Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities, 
particularly within the Retail segment, result in revenue being 
based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers 
at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin 
these estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past 
estimates to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy. 
However, given the level of judgement involved, actual outcomes 
may vary from initial estimates.
 More information: note 8.3 on page 144
Non-statutory measures of financial performance
We present two non-statutory measures on the face of our income 
statement. Our non-statutory measures exclude certain items, 
including any transactions considered to be one-off in nature, 
to provide a measure of the underlying trading and operational 
performance of the Group.
EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial 
performance. EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax, 
depreciation (including asset obsolescence charges and gains or 
losses on asset disposals), amortisation and unrealised gains on 
derivative contracts. In 2014, it also excluded the one-off 
settlement of CESP (see note 2.2 for further details).
Underlying measures, including underlying profit before and after 
tax and underlying earnings per share (EPS) exclude the impact of 
unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence 
charges and the one-off settlement of CESP in 2014. Underlying 
profit after tax and EPS exclude the post-tax effect of these items.
Under our current distribution policy, dividends are calculated 
based upon 50% of underlying profit after tax. A reconciliation 
from profit for the year attributable to equity holders to underlying 
profit after tax is provided in note 2.6.

Section 2: Financial Performance
The financial performance section gives further detail on the information in the Consolidated income 
statement. It includes a summary of financial performance by business unit (2.1), analysis of certain 
income statement items (2.2–2.5) and information regarding underlying earnings, distributable profits 
and dividends (2.6–2.8). Further commentary regarding our trading and operational performance during 
the year, which is predominantly reflected within EBITDA, can be found within the Strategic report on 
pages 1 to 55, with particular reference to key achievements and market conditions that have impacted 
our results.
2.1 Segmental reporting
On 1 March 2015 the Group reorganised into three businesses with a dedicated management team for each: Generation: the generation 
of electricity at Drax Power Station; Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in 
the US; and Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market. Each business is an 
operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Following the reorganisation, information reported to the Board for the 
purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised into these three operating segments. The measure 
of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA.
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Unallocated costs 
are included within central operating costs.
Prior period comparatives have been restated to the extent the information is available. Costs were entirely allocated to segments in 
previous periods.

Notes:
(1)  Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions.
Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management 
accounts. However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2015 was £90 
million (2014: £125 million), of which £22 million (2014: £85 million) relates to construction of assets within the Biomass Supply segment.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. The revenue and results of all of our 
reporting segments are subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.
Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at the time 
of the transaction. During 2015, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £28.4 million (2014: £nil) to the 
Generation segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of £863.2 million (2014: £735.2 million) 
to the Retail segment. 
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£1.6 million at 31 December 2015), is eliminated 
on consolidation.
Major customers
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes amounts of £597.7 million and £468.0 million (2014: £320.6 million and 
£288.7 million) derived from two customers (2014: two customers), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the year. 
These revenues arose in the Generation segment.

2.3 Impairment review and asset obsolescence charges
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units) whenever there is an 
indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate 
independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and Billington Bioenergy) and accordingly 
considers the Group to be comprised of four cash-generating units (CGUs).
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the 
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or cash-generating unit (value in use) 
or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value). 
Whilst IFRS requires estimates of future cash flows to be discounted using a pre-tax rate, market rates are generally more widely available 
on a post-tax basis. In utilising a post-tax discount rate, the Group takes account of its specific tax characteristics to ensure the 
impairment calculations are not affected.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the 
carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
immediately within the income statement.
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2). Impairment charges, as one-off items that are typically not 
reflective of the underlying performance of the Group in a given period, are excluded from underlying earnings (see note 2.6).
Critical judgement areas
During 2015, weak commodity markets and the removal of LEC income for the Generation business contributed to a substantial and 
sustained reduction in the Group’s share price. As a result, the market capitalisation of the Group fell materially below the carrying value of 
the Group’s net assets, an indicator of possible impairment. Accordingly a full impairment review was undertaken at the balance sheet date.
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions. 
In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output, costs and 
economic support for renewable energy generation.
The impairment methodology, calculations and the supporting assumptions were reviewed by the Audit Committee (see page 72). 
The key assumptions were benchmarked and calculation methodology assessed by an independent expert with relevant industry 
experience. The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below.

2.3 Impairment review and asset obsolescence charges continued
Impairment review
The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using a broad range of assumptions, including the expected economic life of its six 
power generating units, their fuel type and the regulatory regime under which they might operate. This included key assumptions that 
each generating unit will be available for operation until 2039 (consistent with the estimated asset life of the Drax Power Station), that 
the outcome of the ongoing EU State aid investigation into the CfD for the third unit conversion would be favourable with a strike price 
consistent with the initial decision published in January 2015 (£100/MWh) and that, where required to support future renewable 
generation upon expiry of the current support mechanisms in 2027, a suitable level of economic incentive would be available to 
maintain commercially acceptable returns.
When making these assumptions the enhancement value available from converting three of the generating units from their current coal 
fuel source to biomass was not included in the value in use results. As a result, the majority of the CGU’s longer term revenues are 
delivered by the biomass units.
Where available, estimates of future prices were based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. Transactions 
beyond contracted positions were valued using forward price curves and, beyond the liquid portion of observable market curves, 
these were constructed internally. A benchmarking exercise confirmed that management’s constructed curves were in line with 
market consensus.
The calculations were discounted using a post-tax nominal rate of 8%. This indicated that the recoverable amount of each of the Group’s 
CGUs exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment were required.
The calculations for each CGU are sensitive to the key assumptions described above. Material adverse changes to these assumptions, 
particularly a delay in the EU State aid approval process or reduction in strike price for the CfD, the loss of existing economic support, the 
lack of adequate economic support for renewable generation post-2027 or any other evidence that the useful lives of assets may be 
materially shorter than assumed, could result in significant impairment charges in future periods.
Asset obsolescence charges
Obsolescence charges have been recognised in 2015, in respect of specific assets as described below:

Following an internal review and extensive testing, during 2015 it was concluded that Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) technology was no 
longer required on converted biomass units within the Generation business and the assets were decommissioned. The recoverable amount 
of these assets was determined to be zero and accordingly the full carrying amount of £92.6 million has been recognised as an asset 
obsolescence charge in the year.
During 2015 we began to install Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction technology across our generating units as part of our strategy to 
ensure  compliance with the requirements of the IED. As a result, development costs associated with a competing solution were determined 
to have a recoverable amount of zero, as the project would not be progressed. The full carrying amount of £10.0 million has therefore been 
recognised as an asset obsolescence charge in the year.
Within the Biomass Supply business, following a decision not to proceed with a third pellet plant project in the US Gulf, the recoverable 
amount of the associated assets was determined to be zero and the full carrying amount of £6.6 million recognised as an asset 
obsolescence charge.

2.4 Net finance costs
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bank loans) as well as foreign 
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see 
note 5.3) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest 
income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.

which amortisation was accelerated following the successful renegotiation of a replacement facility in December 2015 (see note 4.4 
for further details).
2.5 Current and deferred taxation
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on this year’s taxable profits (which 
are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and 
therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is 
expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules (reflected in differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits). The tax 
charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the movement 
in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement. 
Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on taxable profit for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable profit 
differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items income or expense that are either taxable or 
deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be 
paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In the Summer Budget 2015, the UK 
corporation tax main rate has been set by the Finance Act at 19% for the years starting 1 April 2017, 2018 and 2019 and at 18% for the year 
starting 1 April 2020. These rates have therefore been reflected in the deferred tax balances shown below.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively.
Significant judgement areas
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. 
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made 
for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by 
a business unit, particularly those with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support 
recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

2.5 Current and deferred taxation continued
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £19 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: £10 million) in respect of 
UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income. In both cases the business units involved have a history of making 
losses and until sufficient operational performance is established and maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable 
income against which to utilise the benefit of the accumulated losses is not considered to be probable.
2.6 Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary share we have 
in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during 
the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under our employee share 
schemes – see note 6.2), that are currently expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares 
as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated (note 2.7). 
Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence charges and the one-off 
settlement of CESP in 2014 from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and 
cash resources.
 
The immediate cash resources of the Group are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.5. The majority 
of these cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group, in particular Drax Power Limited.
 
The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 146 to 151 of this report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable 
reserves of £222 million. Following a reorganisation of the subsidiary companies undertaken during the year (described in note 4 to the 
Parent Company financial statements) the wider Group has, relative to previous dividend payments (note 2.7), sufficient retained profits 
available for future distributions in accordance with the Group divided policy.

3.1 Property, plant and equipment
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to 
generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset 
over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful 
economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.
Additions in 2015 include a further £90 million (2014: £125 million) on our biomass transformation project, which is now largely complete 
and in line with initial expectations on timing and overall cost. At Drax Power Station we now have two fully converted units running on 
biomass fuel with a third operating as an enhanced co-fired unit burning up to 90% biomass. Upstream, in our US-based wood pellet 
manufacturing business, both pellet plant facilities and the port facility commenced commercial operations during the year.
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and 
rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment 
in value. 
We construct many of our assets ourselves as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are 
not depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station). The table below 
shows the range of useful lives and the average useful life of an asset in the main categories of asset we own in years:
 
UEL (range)
Freehold buildings
14–32
Plant and machinery
 Electricity generation plant
2–32
 Pellet production plant
5–25
 Other plant
2–30
 Decommissioning asset
35
Plant spare parts
Up to 35
Freehold land, held at cost, is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. 
Within the plant and machinery categories shorter lives are attributed to assets that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling 
outage cycles. Within the Electricity generation plant category the majority of the remaining net book value relates to assets with UELs 
greater than 25 years. Within the pellet production plant category the majority of the remaining net book value relates to assets with 
UELs greater than 20 years.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and 
technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Critical judgement areas
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date. The 
carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment (see note 2.3) where there has been a trigger event 
(that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net 
realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on 
management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore subjective. Estimated useful lives are based on 
past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence; however an inherent degree of judgement remains.

3.2 ROC and LEC assets
We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result of burning 
renewable biomass to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not yet sold. 
As we generate more of our electricity by burning renewable biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC assets we 
generate will increase. Haven Power provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs.
Following the government’s decision to remove the CCL exemption for power generated from renewable sources, as of 1 August 2015 we no 
longer earn LECs for electricity generated from renewable biomass. The remaining balance sheet value of LECs represents LECs earned 
before 1 August 2015 which are yet to be sold to customers. We expect to recover the carrying amount of these LECs in full in 2016.
Accounting policy
ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based 
on anticipated sales prices. The value of ROCs and LECs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs 
in that period.
Where our retail activities incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred. 
At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC and LEC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales 
prices including, where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our 
own ROC obligations. Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.
Critical judgement areas
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs and LECs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding 
future sales prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates 
that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ.
ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the recycle fund at the end of the compliance 
period, where Supplier buy out charges (incurred by Suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are returned 
to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. Such estimates are subject to assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and 
supply over the compliance period and thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to 
its own forecasts in calculating these estimates. Past experience indicates the values arrived at are reasonable but remain subject to 
possible variation.

3.3 Inventories
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the 
production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the 
end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.
Accounting policy
Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including 
the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and 
transport/handling costs.
Critical judgement areas
Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, given the storage and handling characteristics of coal and biomass, an element of 
judgement is inherent in calculating the volume of fuel stocks on site at any given time.
Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving around or exiting sites using technology regularly calibrated to 
industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency 
calculations to provide closing stock volumes, with the most prudent valuation adopted in preparing financial statements. Both 
calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error.
Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, with a provision made where the 
survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey 
depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass is stored in sealed domes with a carefully 
controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes. Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR 
scanning technology. However, this survey remains subject to a tolerable error range.
Experience indicates that the estimates and assumptions made by management in calculating stock volumes are reasonable. However, 
the level of judgement and tolerable error range involved means that actual values may differ from initial calculations.

3.4 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid 
for. Other receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power 
delivered that will be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to 
receive the relevant goods or services in return (e.g. insurance premiums we have paid for in advance that will be utilised within the year).
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established 
subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms 
of the receivable.

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties within both our generation and retail businesses. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group had amounts receivable from two (2014: four) significant counterparties within the generation business, 
representing 41% (2014: 68%) of trade receivables, both of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms. 
Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2015, £41 million (2014: £34 million) relates to retail power sales. The risk profile of retail debt 
is different from that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence a lower concentration of credit risk, 
with different payment terms. All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment 
and provisions made where appropriate. The value of retail debts that are past-due and not provided against, in accordance with this 
assessment, is not material. 
Accordingly, management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision for doubtful 
debts of £4.9 million (2014: £6.8 million). This provision, which largely relates to retail receivables, has been determined with reference to 
past default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

the future as a result of our activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).

4.4 Borrowings
Our financing structure includes £325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of £100 million with various funds managed 
by M&G Investments, a £75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the 
Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, a £50 million amortising term loan with Green Investment Bank and a £100 million amortising term 
loan facility with M&G UK Companies Financing Fund. The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025. All of the term 
loans were fully drawn down at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014. 
In December 2015 we successfully refinanced our £400 million revolving credit facility. The new facility matures in December 2019 and 
has a margin of 175 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2015 this facility had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total 
value of £37.9 million (see note 7.5).
At the same time we also renewed our commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades 
without the requirement to post collateral.
Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the 
principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the 
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement 
over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Analysis of borrowings
Borrowings at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans.

Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.

Section 5: Other Assets and Liabilities
This section includes all other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, not covered 
in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.
5.1 Acquisitions 
On 4 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Billington Bioenergy Limited (Billington Bioenergy), obtaining 
control of the company. Billington Bioenergy is a wood pellet distributor in the UK renewable-fuelled heating market. It gives us an important 
opportunity to work with the UK heat sector to ensure that the many benefits of biomass are fully understood. We hope to drive substantial 
growth in this market over the coming years. 
Accounting policy
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as 
incurred. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable 
net assets acquired.
The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Billington 
Bioenergy are as set out in the table below:

The acquisition consideration of £4.0 million was settled entirely in cash, with no deferred or contingent consideration payable.
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was £4.0 million.
Billington Bioenergy contributed revenues of £4.7 million and EBITDA of £nil to the results of the Group in the period between the 
acquisition date and the balance sheet date. 
5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. Our goodwill 
relates to the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 and Billington Bioenergy in 2015. Other intangibles include any amounts paid in respect 
of carbon emission allowances for future years.
Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit to which it relates and the recoverable amount 
for that cash-generating unit assessed.

Total goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2015 was £14.5 million, with £10.7 million arising on the acquisition of 
Haven Power attributed to Haven Power and £3.8 million arising on the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy in the period (31 December 
2014: £10.7 million entirely attributable to Haven Power Limited).
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting the economic benefits from Haven 
Power’s cash generative profile.

5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions in this 
calculation are the same as those used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2015 and are 
disclosed in note 2.3.
Given the short time since the acquisition, management consider the fair value of Billington Bioenergy to be equivalent to the purchase 
price, which was supported by an independent valuation. 
Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the current financial 
year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the 
current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further 
purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.
5.3 Provisions
We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and 
remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. The amount represents the present value (i.e. it is discounted to 
reflect the time value of money) of the expected costs. Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount, and as such by 
their nature are estimated.
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the 
expected costs. No allowance is made within the provision for expected proceeds on disposal of scrap or assets to third parties, as the 
uncertainty over market prices at the estimated decommissioning date mean such an asset would not be virtually certain at the balance 
sheet date. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built in risks 
specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is 
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.

The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been estimated 
using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent 
update took place in 2014.

Savings-Related Share Option (SAYE) Plan for all qualifying employees. We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our 
income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy
All of the Group’s share-based payments are equity-settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity 
instrument at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares 
that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other 
senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the 
Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion of the 
shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2015, 2014 and 
2013 BMP awards, of £3.3 million, £5.4 million and £6.1 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

SAYE – Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.
Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.
6.3 Retirement benefit obligations
We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes. 
The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement 
under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically 
entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three 
times pension.
The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution 
schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme.

Drax Group plc   
Annual report and accounts 2015
Section 6: Our People continued
6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to 
the contributions.
For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains 
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately 
in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit 
costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised within the 
income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is 
recognised within finance costs.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect 
of the current period.
Significant judgement areas
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including 
discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually 
and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are 
reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ 
from such assumptions.
The assumptions used in 2015 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with 
independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates three defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and 
Drax Biomass inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows:

As at 31 December 2015, contributions of £0.4 million (2014: £0.4 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid 
over to the schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit scheme
The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) was closed to new members as from 1 January 
2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to 
build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk
The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets 
(equities, property and direct lending) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, 
create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains 
appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Interest rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will 
be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.
Longevity risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will 
lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely 
correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on 
inflationary increases are in place, to protect against extreme inflation.
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the government increasing 
the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members 
with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. See note 7.5 for details.

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2013. 
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years. The next valuation will therefore take place on or before 
31 March 2016. 
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2015, taking into account experience 
over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit 
method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are 
that a member who retired in 2015 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years (2014: 27 years) after retirement if they are male 
and for a further 29 years (2014: 29 years) after retirement if they are female. Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female 
non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 28 years and 31 years respectively (2014: 28 years and 31 years respectively).
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value 
of the plan assets, determined as follows:

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. 
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets 
are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market 
principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative 
to the actual asset allocation for the scheme.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a 
potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity 
of the pension deficit at 31 December 2015 to changes in these assumptions:

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions 
where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (25%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the 
duration of the liabilities, is currently 22 years.
The Group expects to contribute £8.3 million to its pension plans during the 12 months ended 31 December 2016. 
The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the last triennial valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.

Section 7: Risk Management
This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments 
we use to mitigate such risks.
7.1 Risk management disclosures
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of 
commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk management 
committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 52) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close co-
ordination with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable 
biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the 
financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so. 
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow 
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity. 
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities 
from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and 
financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the 
Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal. 
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and 
international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow 
hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances. 
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the 
balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date. 
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
– 
profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £6.7 million (2014: decrease/increase by £9.4 million). 
This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and
– 
the hedge reserve would decrease/increase by £11.5 million (2014: decrease/increase by £12.0 million) mainly as a result of the 
changes in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.
Interest rate risk
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate this risk 
with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet 
date; however this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to 
interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided below.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance 
sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date 
was outstanding for the whole year. 
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £1.8 million (2014: decrease/increase by £1.4 million) as a result of the changes 
in interest payable during the period.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases 
in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in Euros. As our biomass transformation plans have 
progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange contracts. Exchange rate exposures are managed 
within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
– 
profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £233.3 million/£241.1 million (2014: decrease/
increase by £261.0 million/£275.3 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts 
entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and
– 
other equity reserves would increase/decrease by £67.8 million/£75.0 million (2014: increase/decrease by £48.7 million/£53.9 million) 
as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a 
mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements. 
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both 
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest 
rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is exposed to the 
risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver against the 
contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers. 
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or 
more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile 
of the Group.

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £4.9 million (2014: £6.8 million). 
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. Where considered 
appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of 
charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage credit 
risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity 
(excluding the hedge reserve), plus net cash. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.4, cash and cash equivalents in note 
4.2 and short-term investments in note 4.3.

7.2 Derivative financial instruments
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and 
CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial contracts 
(principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price risk, and 
foreign currency risk (see note 7.1).
A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price 
movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to 
de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future.
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence 
the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time. 
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in 
question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).
Accounting policy
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair 
value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, 
sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances 
and forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with 
changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges 
in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.

Critical judgement areas
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price 
curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or 
settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves 
upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally 
extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future 
prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option 
pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and 
assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market 
movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
Fair value accounting
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial 
coal, financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market and recorded 
in the balance sheet at fair value as follows:

7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued 
The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of £147.1 million (2014: £166.2 million loss) is recognised in the income statement 
or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows:

Total unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts
147.1
166.2
Unrealised gains in the income statement in 2015 are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward currency exchange 
contracts. We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in 
foreign currencies, principally denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The high volume of contracts held (demonstrated 
in the table on page 137) means low levels of exchange rate volatility can have a significant impact on amounts recognised in our income 
statement in respect of these contracts. The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are 
denominated in US dollars. The overall strengthening of the US dollar against sterling during 2015 resulted in further significant 
unrealised gains in the current year.
During 2015 the liquid portion of the forward power curve contracted and as a result we extended the use of longer-dated contracts to sell 
gas as a proxy for power hedging. Whilst the correlation is strong, the hedge is not perfect and thus we do not apply hedge accounting to 
these contracts. Falling market gas prices during 2015 have contributed further gains to the income statement as our hedged positions are 
at a price that is better than could be achieved in the market as at the balance sheet date. 
These gains were partially offset by unrealised losses on our financial oil purchase contracts as a result of the continuing decline in oil 
prices during 2015. We utilise financial contracts to fix oil indexation in fuel purchase contracts.
Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts 
that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39 and forward contracts for the sale of power which have 
increased in value relative to the market as price weakness continued in 2015.
Fair value measurement
– 
Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not excluded 
through the own use exemption, are calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are 
generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for 
financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
– 
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is 
determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
– 
Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not 
excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts 
are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain 
embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and 
therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows:
Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison 
between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2. 
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

7.3 Other financial instruments
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and 
receivables arising from our operations.
Accounting policy
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), short-term investments (note 4.3), trade and other receivables (note 3.4), and trade and other 
payables (note 3.5) generally have short times to maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate 
to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings (note 4.4) relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts 
of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.
7.4 Hedge reserve
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent 
that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related 
contracts mature, and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.
As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging; however not all of these 
contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS 
effective hedge are recognised in the income statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down 
exposures to moving prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges. 
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk 
management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of 
contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end 
for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then 
released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the 
underlying power is delivered. For FX contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further 
information about the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.

7.5 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control. 
The amount and timing of any payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males. 
This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 6.3). At present, the methodology for 
implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for 
GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.
Borrowings
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of 
banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2015 the Group’s contingent 
liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £37.9 million (2014: £50.5 million).
Invoices subject to dispute resolution
At the balance sheet date, the Group was engaged in a commercial dispute resolution process relating to certain invoices received for the 
year ending 31 December 2015. No entries have been made in the financial statements in respect of these items as the existence and 
value of any potential liability remains uncertain. Under the terms of our contract the Group is entitled to withhold payment until the 
dispute is resolved.
7.6 Commitments
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded 
in our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and 
biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

Section 8: Reference Information
This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general 
information about the Group (e.g. operations and registered office). We also set out the basis of 
preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.
8.1 General information
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together, the Group) have three principal activities:
– 
Electricity generation;
– 
Electricity supply to business customers;
– 
Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. The Group

8.2 Basis of preparation
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In 2015, one new, amended or revised standard became effective. The Group adopted the following standard from 1 January 2015:
Annual improvements to 2011-2013 Cycle.
The adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which 
have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement 
by the EU - marked by *):
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*
IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*

The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9, which may materially change the presentation of derivative 
financial instruments held by the Group and accounted for at fair value. The Group currently intends to adopt the standard in the earliest 
permitted accounting period, subject to endorsement by the EU.
The Group is also in the process of assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 15 and IFRS 16; however at this stage neither standard is 
expected to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of amounts within the financial statements. The  
Group currently expects to adopt these standards in the period they become mandatory, subject to EU endorsement.
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

8.3 Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific note.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and 
other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between Group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity are measured based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing 
market rates as applicable.
Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are stated at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the ROC or LEC is 
transferred to the account of that third party. 
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving rise 
to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as giving rise to 
revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents 
received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value 
of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to customers through our retail business, Haven Power, is recorded after deduction of agreed 
discounts, VAT and CCL. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable 
price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied, 
but not yet measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction and from the 
translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, are recognised in the income statement within 
finance costs.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using published 
exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenditure of such operations are translated to sterling using the exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the operating net assets 
and the results for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

8.4 Related party transactions

The remuneration of the Executive Committee members, who are considered to be the key management personnel of the Group, is set 
out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 “Related party disclosures”. Further information about the 
remuneration of individual directors, together with the directors’ interests in the share capital of Drax Group plc, is provided in the audited

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC). 
In the year-ended 31 December 2015 the Company has decided to adopt Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101) as issued by the FRC and has undergone transition from reporting under pre-2015 UK GAAP to FRS 101. Accordingly, 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC 
in July 2015 and the amendments to Company law made by the Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2015 prior to their mandatory effective date of accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016).
This transition is not considered to have had a material effect on the financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent 
disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
summarised below, and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
(A) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where relevant, provision for impairment.
(B) Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records amounts by which the proceeds from issuing shares 
exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act (2006) are met, in which case 
the difference is recorded in retained earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. 
Short-term investments – Short-term investments includes cash held on deposit with financial institutions with a maturity of greater 
than three months at inception.
3. Profit and loss account
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the 
year. The Company’s profit and loss account was approved by the Board on 22 February 2016. Drax Group plc reported a profit for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 of £52.0 million (2014: £52.7 million). The Company received dividend income from its subsidiary 
undertakings totalling £54.5 million in 2015 (2014: £55.0 million).
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and a proportion 
was recharged to the Company. 
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 was £20,000 (2014: £20,000).

Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
On 5 March 2015 the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Billington Bioenergy Limited for consideration of £4,034,000.
On 7 December 2015 the Group reorganised its corporate structure. The Company disposed of its interests in its direct subsidiary 
undertakings to Drax Group Holdings Limited (DGHL) for consideration of £671,616,000 settled by acquisition of 100% of the share capital 
of DGHL.
The capital contribution relates to the share-based payment charge associated with the Savings-Related Share Option Plan and Bonus 
Matching Plan schemes, which arises because the beneficiaries of the scheme are employed by subsidiary companies. For more information 
see note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements (2014: £92,725,000 capital injection into a subsidiary, and £5,881,000 in relation to 
share-based payment charges).

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. 
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Issued under employee share schemes
On 26 January, 13 February and 24 February a total of 12,893 shares were issued on early vesting of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan by 
three individuals whose employment had terminated due to retirement. On 9 March 1,022,848 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares 
vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan. Throughout March to June a total of 435,681 shares were issued 
in satisfaction of options vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. On 2 July 24,179 shares 
were issues on early vesting of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan by one individual whose employment terminated and discretion was used 
to exercise the shares.
6. Distributable reserves
Note 7 sets out the proposed final dividend of £2.3 million in respect of 2015.
The Company considers its distributable reserves to be comprised of the profit and loss account with a total value of £222 million. 
Accordingly the Company considers itself to have sufficient distributable profits from which to pay the current year final dividend. Based 
on a total dividend for 2015 of £23 million, the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay nine years of dividend at the current 
level without generating further distributable profits.
The Company is dependent upon its subsidiaries for the provision of cash with which to make dividend payments. As shown in note 4.2 to 
the consolidated financial statements the Group has sufficient cash resources with which to meet the proposed dividend.

have been issued for £nil consideration and the Company has not charged the subsidiary for the guarantees. 
The Company has granted a charge over the assets of certain of its subsidiaries, in respect of the Group’s debt (detailed in note 4.4 to the 
consolidated financial statements), which is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the subsidiary undertakings of the Company 
that are party to the security arrangement. The Company itself is not a guarantor of the Group’s debt.

Tax on dividends
In the 2015 Budget, the Chancellor announced changes in the 
way that dividends would be taxed in the future. Below is a brief 
summary of the guidance provided by HMRC. If you are in any 
doubt as to the impact on your personal circumstances, you are 
recommended to seek your own financial advice from a professional 
adviser authorised under the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000.
From April 2016, there will be an income tax charge on dividends 
at the rate of 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate 
taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers. 
The long-standing system of tax credits attached to dividends 
will be replaced with a new tax-free Dividend Allowance. This 
will mean that there will be no tax to pay on the first £5,000 
of dividend income, no matter what non-dividend income a 
shareholder may have. Dividends paid on shares held within 
pensions and ISAs will be unaffected, remaining tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend 
income between £5,001 and £10,000 will need to make a 
declaration (to HMRC) for the first time. Individuals with dividend 
income of more than £10,000 are already required to be in HMRCs 
Self-Assessment regime. The impact on Share Incentive Plan 
participants receiving cash dividends on their plan shares align with 
those for Shareholders. Further information and updates on tax on 
dividends can be found on the HMRC website at www.gov.uk/
tax-on-dividends/overview. 
As the Dividend Tax Credit will no longer be required it is 
expected that a dividend confirmation will still need to be sent 
to shareholders to replace the old “tax voucher”. The Company is 
currently considering whether to move to the practice of issuing 
just one dividend confirmation document towards the end of the 
tax year, irrespective of the number of cash payments made during 
the course of the year, rather than issuing a document each time 
a dividend is paid. Shareholders will be advised of the outcome 
in due course.

Beneficial owners and “information rights”
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA 
provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, receive 
information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. 
In order for this to happen, you must contact the third party 
registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications 
by beneficial owners of shares where the shares are held by third 
party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder 
and not to Drax or Equiniti.
ShareGift
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent 
charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing 
to dispose charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most 
likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no capital 
gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares 
to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. 
Further information can be obtained directly from the charity 
at www.sharegift.org.
Share frauds (“Boiler room scams”)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently 
inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message in the 
correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder 
who is looking to take over the Company. At the time of this report, 
the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or 
otherwise, and approaches such as those outlined are usually 
made by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders 
should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. Below is 
the advice from the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).
Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to 
be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in 
return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you 
buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud
– 
Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
– 
Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
– 
Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
– 
Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
– 
Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back.
– 
Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
– 
Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.
uk/scams.
– 
Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised 
firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
– 
Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the 
share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you 
can find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should 
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Glossary
Advantaged fuels
Fuel that gives a price advantage against 
standard bituminous coals. Such fuels include 
pond fines, off-specification coal and petcoke.
Ancillary services
Services provided to national grid used for 
balancing supply and demand or maintaining 
secure electricity supplies within acceptable 
limits. They are described in Connection 
Condition 8 of the Grid Code.
Availability
Average percentage of time the units were 
available for generation.
Average achieved price
Power revenues divided by volume of net 
sales (includes imbalance charges).
Balancing mechanism
The sub-set of the market through which 
the system operator can call upon additional 
generation/consumption or reduce generation/
consumption through market participants’ bids 
and offers, in order to balance the system 
minute-by-minute.
Bark spread
The difference between the power price and 
the cost of biomass, net of renewable support.
Carbon price support mechanism 
(or carbon price floor or carbon tax)
A tax upon fossil fuels (including coal) used to 
generate electricity. It is charged as a levy on 
coal delivered to the power station.
Contracts for difference (CfD)
A mechanism to support investment in 
low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD 
works by stabilising revenues for generators 
at a fixed price level known as the “strike 
price”. Generators will receive revenue from 
selling their electricity into the market as 
usual. However, when the market reference 
price is below the strike price they will also 
receive a top-up payment from suppliers for 
the additional amount. Conversely if the 
reference price is above the strike price, the 
generator must pay back the difference.
Dark green spread
The difference between the power price and 
the cost of coal and carbon.
EBITDA
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation, gains or losses on disposal of 
property, plant and equipment and unrealised
