Changes of state
Changing states of water
Through heating and cooling, we can change the state of materials. The 
diagram below shows how water changes state when heated or cooled.
All materials are either a solid, a liquid, or a gas. These are the three states of matter.

Boiling point
The boiling point of 
water is 100°C.  When the 
temperature rises above this 
point, the water evaporates 
and becomes a gas. When 
the gas cools, e.g. when the 
steam from a shower hits a 
cold window), it condenses 
back into water.
Freezing point
The freezing point of water 
is 0°C.  At this point, the liquid 
changes into solid ice. This 
process is called freezing.

Reversible changes
The changes that happen to water between 
its different states (solid - ice, liquid - water, 
and gas – water vapour/steam) are reversible 
because we can reverse the change to get the 
original substance back. Examples of reversible 
changes include dissolving, evaporation, 
melting and freezing. 
For example, you can freeze juice to make ice 
lollies, then apply heat to melt the lollies and 
change them back into juice.
Irreversible changes
Irreversible changes are ones that you can’t 
reverse - it’s impossible to go back to the 
previous state or original material. Examples 
of irreversible changes include heating, mixing 
and burning. 
For example, heating a raw egg to cook it is an 
irreversible change because, once it’s cooked, 
the egg cannot be changed back into a raw egg. 
Vocabulary
Freezing 
When a liquid turns into a solid
Freezing point 
The same temperature as a material’s melting point. This is the temperature at 
which a liquid turns into a solid
Melting 
When a solid turns into a liquid
Melting point 
The temperature at which a solid melts
Temperature 
A measurement of how hot or cold something is
Thermometer 
A device or instrument used to measure temperature
Do you know why we 
add salt to roads and 
paths in the winter?
Sprinkling salt onto ice causes the 
ice to melt because salt lowers the 
freezing point of the water.
