THE LEGEND OF CRUACHAN
The Cailleach Bheur, 
(the Old Hag of the Ridges) 
was the guardian of a fountain that welled 
up from the peak of Ben Cruachan.
It was her duty to cover the spring with a 
slab of stone at sundown and lift away 
the rock at sunrise.
One evening she fell asleep 
and the well overflowed. 
The water,  rushing down the mountainside, 
burst open a new outlet to the sea 
through the Pass of Brander.  
By the time the Cailleach awoke, 
the water had flooded the wide strath below 
and drowned all the people and their cattle.
So was formed the River Awe and Loch Awe.
The Cailleach was turned to stone 
and sits to this day 
high on the mountain 
above the Pass of Brander.
Cruachan is a 440 MW reversible pump-storage 
power station, situated on the banks of Loch Awe 
in Argyll.
One of only four pumped-storage facilities in 
Britain, Cruachan is owned and operated by Drax.  
It was constructed during the early 1960s and 
was officially opened on October 15th 1965 by 
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
The power station is built deep into the heart of 
Ben Cruachan.  The only visible evidence of its 
existence is the high storage dam on the slopes of 
Ben Cruachan and the administration office block 
beside Loch Awe.
To meet peak demands, power stations must 
increase their output and bring on additional 
generating sets.  During periods of minimum 
demand generator sets are switched off or run 
at part loads.  For most conventional forms of 
generation, using fuel such as coal, this variation 
in output to match demand is inefficient.

Pumped-storage power stations can provide a 
way of minimising these changes in output for 
conventional generating sets by, in effect, storing 
the excess generated electricity when demand 
is low.  This allows the conventional generator to 
continue at full output and the stored electricity 
is then released to meet the peak demands, 
thereby reducing the need to turn on additional 
conventional generating sets.
Cruachan generates up to 440 MW of electricity 
during times of peak demand, using water from 
the upper reservoir on Ben Cruachan to drive 
the turbines.  At times when the demand is low, 
the surplus electricity is absorbed from the grid 
system to enable the turbines to be driven in the 
reverse direction to act as pumps.  These pumps 
lift water from Loch Awe, which serves as the 
lower reservoir on Ben Cruachan.  Due to the large 
surface area of Loch Awe, the operation of the 
power station has little effect on its water levels.
The upper reservoir was created by building a concrete gravity buttress dam, 316 metres long and 46 metres high, 
across a wind swept corrie (a basin shaped hollow in the mountainside) high on the flanks of Ben Cruachan.
The dam houses two water intakes, feeding water to the power station.  Each intake can be closed by means of a 3.7m 
x 4.9m control gate which is backed up by a 3.8m x 5.9m bulkhead gate.
Nineteen kilometres of tunnels and piped aqueducts divert water from streams around the mountain into this reservoir, 
increasing the catchment area from 8 sq km to 23 sq km, thus supplementing the water pumped up from Loch Awe.
Deep in the heart of the mountain, almost 400 metres below the upper reservoir, a series of chambers 
were cut out of the solid rock to house the underground power station.  In total, the excavations extracted 
220,000 cubic metres of rock and spoil. 
Deep inside the Hollow 
A gradually sloping tunnel, 1 kilometre long, was driven into the mountain to provide road access to the 
power station.  This tunnel is about 7 metres wide and 4 metres high.
At the lower end of the tunnel is the ‘cross-roads’ which provides access points to the machine hall, transformer 
halls and the visitors’ gallery.
The largest chamber, the machine hall, housing the turbine and generator sets is about 90 metres long and 
36 metres high, large enough to contain a seven storey building erected on a full size football pitch.
On one wall of the machine hall is a mural of inlaid woods depicting the legend of Cruachan.
This mural was designed by London artist, Elizabeth Falconer.

Cruachan 
Machine Hall
36 metres high and about 90 metres 
long, the machine hall is large enough 
to contain a seven storey building 
erected on a full size football pitch.
The machine hall houses four generator/
motor sets, capable of generating 440 MW of 
electricity.  When pumping, each set absorbs 
approx. 110 MW.
The total weight of each combined generator/
pump and turbine/pump is 650 tonnes.  The 
rotating parts alone weigh 250 tonnes per 
machine.
The part of each machine showing above the 
machine hall floor and which is visible from 
the visitors’ viewing gallery is the pony motor.  
This is an induction motor rated at 10,000 
horse power and its purpose is to spin the 
machine from rest up to synchronous speed 
in the pump direction.  Once the main rotor is 
excited the pony motor is switched out and 
the main machine motor drives the pump to 
lift the water to the upper reservoir.
From standstill, each machine is capable of reaching 
full generating output in two minutes and full 
pumping load in eight minutes.  This speed of 
response is a major advantage over conventional 
forms of generation.  
For even faster response, the turbines can also 
spin in air with the machines synchronised to the 
system.  This is achieved by using compressed air to 
lower the water level in the turbine casing to clear 
the turbine runner of water.  When operated in this 
way, the machines can reach full output in seconds, 
providing immediate standby generating capacity.
Two of the machines are connected to a 230 MVA 
transformer, the other two are each connected to a 
150 MVA transformer making three in total.
These oil immersed water cooled transformers  con-
vert the generated voltage of 16,000v to the trans-
mission voltage of 275,000v.
The supergrid transformers are housed in large 
chambers near the main machine hall.

Cruachan Machine Hall
Busbar galleries and cable tunnels connect these 
transformers to switchgear in the machine hall 
and to the cable shaft.
The cable shaft houses the main power 
connections from the station to the transmission 
grid.  There are six 275kV oil filled cables in a 4m 
diameter vertical concrete lined shaft.
These cables emerge near the foot of the dam 
and connect to the terminal tower of a dual 
circuit 275kV transmission line which carries 
the power to the local switching sub station at 
Dalmally and then on to Windyhill near Glasgow.  
This transmission line is supported along its 
length by 254 steel towers and at its highest 
level, the line reaches 550m above sea level.
When the machines are generating, water flows 
from the upper reservoir through two concrete 
lined shafts, known as penstocks, each of which 
then splits into two steel lined pipes 2m in 
diameter.  On entering the machine hall, these 
steel lined pipes are each terminated with a 1.8m 
diameter main inlet valve.  This valve allows the 
water to flow into the turbine and is opened and 
closed every time the machine operates.
The machine hall floor, which is visible from the 
viewing gallery, is 36m below the normal level 
of Loch Awe. There are four further floor levels 
beneath this with the turbine runners sitting 
50m beneath the level of Loch Awe.
After the water passes through the turbines, it 
flows through a steel lined draft tube pipe up 
to a high rectangular surge chamber.  All four 
machines are connected to this single surge 
chamber and from here, the water flows to Loch 
Awe along a 975m long, 7m diameter tail-race 
tunnel.  This tunnel, which is concrete lined and 
horseshoe shaped in section, enters Loch Awe at 
the forebay area next to the visitor centre.  The  
forebay encloses the tunnel exit with screens to 
prevent fish being drawn into the power station.  
When the machines are pumping, the flow of 
water is reversed from Loch Awe to the upper 
reservoir. 
At the entrance to the road tunnel leading to the 
power station stands the administration building.  
Nearby, a purpose-built visitors’ centre and 
parking facilities have also been constructed on 
ground reclaimed from Loch Awe by tipping the 
rock excavated from the tunnel and cavern.

Cruachan’s Timeline
1921 The final report of the Water Power Resources Committee, set up to 
 
investigate potential sources of hydro power in Britain, contained two 
 
schemes, one for Loch Awe, the other for Loch Nant.
1956 A scheme was drawn up for a 400 megawatt development at Cruachan 
 
with four 100 megawatt machines.
1959 The construction of Cruachan began, with the main works taking place 
 
over a six-year period. These started with the excavation of the access 
 
tunnels and adits, and then of the large caverns needed to house the 
 
main machinery and transformers. The massive buttress dam was built 
 
over a period of two years.
1965 Two of the generator/turbine sets were completed by 1965; and on 
 
15 October of the same year Cruachan Power Station was officially 
 
opened by Her Majesty The Queen.
1967 The last of the four generator/turbine sets came into service.
At Drax, we do things differently from other power companies. Most want to 
grow their businesses in wind and solar. These are intermittent renewables, 
reliant on the weather. We will be there when the wind isn’t blowing and the 
sun isn’t shining, with biomass, hydro power and - such as at Cruachan - with 
pumped storage.
We are committed to supporting the UK and Scottish governments meet their 
climate change commitments and move towards a low carbon economy. 
By working together, we are enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
