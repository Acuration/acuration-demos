Section 1: Introduction 
Introduction 
Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) will be critical in helping the UK meet net zero. 
To enable this, we are seeking to develop CCUS clusters with Transport and Storage (T&S) 
networks acting as the enabling infrastructure for a range of capture projects, including gas 
power plants, industry, low carbon hydrogen production, bioenergy, and direct air capture.  
CCUS applications can be an engine to drive clean, sustainable growth in our industrial 
regions and create opportunities for their low carbon economic transformation. It can also 
stimulate the development of new UK supply chains and attract inward investment. The UK 
has the potential to be a world-leader in the global CCUS market, including the use of our 
significant CO₂ storage potential by providing a decarbonisation service to other countries. 
Deploying CCUS technologies in the UK will: 
• support the net zero transition; and 
• contribute to the levelling up of the UK economy. 
To put us on this pathway, our ambition (as stated in the Prime Minister’s recent Ten Point 
Plan1) is to have a CCUS sector with an operational capability of capturing 10 MtCO₂ per year 
by 2030. This is the equivalent of around four million cars’ worth of annual emissions or the 
current industrial emissions of the Humber.  
To achieve this, we will invest up to £1 billion to support the establishment of CCUS in four 
industrial clusters, creating several ‘SuperPlaces’. These will bring together clean industry, 
power, hydrogen, and transport in areas such as the North East, the Humber, the North West, 
Scotland, and Wales. We aim to establish CCUS in two industrial clusters by the mid-2020s 
and in a further two industrial clusters by 2030, subject to Value for Money (VfM) and 
affordability considerations, and we will use consumer subsidies to support construction of at 
least one power CCUS plant to be operational by 2030. In 2021, we will set out our approach 
to deploy CCUS clusters. This will also help support delivering our ambition of deploying 5GW 
of hydrogen by 2030. 
Purpose of this document

update on the proposed commercial frameworks for T&S, power, and Industrial Carbon 
Capture (ICC) business models. A status update on the progress of the hydrogen business 
models is also provided.  
It reaffirms the principles which will guide the development of the CCUS business models as 
well as setting out their objectives. This document also provides an outline of the legal and 
commercial frameworks for CCUS, which we assume will be applicable to all clusters.  
We will continue to extensively engage with prospective developers and wider stakeholders in 
2021 to test and further develop the business model designs outlined in this document. Our 
objective is to create frameworks which deliver on our deployment ambitions and create a 
sustainable market for CCUS infrastructure and capture services.  
The business model update in the document is focused on development of the deployment 
ambition as set out in the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan and the recently published Energy 
White Paper4. As CCUS develops from initial deployment into a mature market at the heart of a 
Net Zero economy we would expect the business models and broader market to evolve 
through the 2020s based on experience and track record.

Section 2: CCUS Deployment 
Introduction 
This section sets out the principles that we will apply in developing the business models. It sets 
out a number of unique challenges to CCUS and how the government aims to address those 
challenges through the design of CCUS business models. 
Principles of business model design 
In the August 2019 government response to the consultation on potential business models for 
CCUS, the following key principles were established: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Decarbonisation 
Policies should incentivise efficient capture, usage and storage of CO2 where production is necessary but should not 
incentivise production of CO2 or result in perverse outcomes. 
Sustainable financing 
Policies should instil confidence among investors and attract new domestic and international entrants to the market 
in a sustainable manner and have the potential to be subsidy free. 
Economy 
Policies should create value to the UK economy and support high-value jobs. 
Cost reductions 
Policies should harness opportunities to drive down cost through innovation, learning by doing and competition as 
appropriate. 
Market and flexibility 
Policies should be market based and minimise distortions in existing markets. They should be compatible with 
existing market frameworks but retain the flexibility to respond to market conditions and public needs as markets 
and the economy evolve.  
Value for money 
Policies should be cost-efficient, providing value for money for taxpayers and consumers, and provide a risk-adjusted 
fair return to investors whilst recognising the first of a kind (FOAK) nature of the sector that with industry, we need 
to develop.  
Fair and reflective costs 
The cost of deploying CCUS should be reflective and fair to users, and not undermine UK industrial competitiveness. 
 
10 
These principles continue to guide our approach to CCUS business model design. Whilst there 
are commonalities between CCUS and other sectors (e.g. T&S networks share similar 
characteristics with regulated infrastructure), the fact that deployment of CCUS in the UK has 
not been commercially demonstrated needs to be reflected in the business model design to 
enable the transition to a fully market-led solution when the industry matures, risks evolve and 
carbon policy is developed.  
A key feature of our work is to ensure that the business models and the CCS Infrastructure 
Fund (CIF) incentivise decarbonisation and cost reductions whilst minimising market distortions 
in a way that achieves VfM for the consumer and taxpayer whilst complying with subsidy 
control regimes and aligning with fiscal rules.  
The CCUS opportunity 
CCUS represents a huge opportunity for the UK economy. It will play an important part in 
reducing the UK’s carbon emissions and reaching net zero by 2050. For some industries, 
CCUS will represent the only viable way of reducing emissions while remaining internationally 
competitive. 
CCUS will require significant investment over the coming decades. This investment will 
develop a new industry and the UK economy will be able to develop new technologies, new 
skills, and high value employment opportunities. CCUS will be a sector in its own right and one 
that will create opportunities for UK firms to export their expertise to other countries. In later 
years CCUS will develop into a market-led technological solution to climate change. UK carbon 
storage could also take carbon from other countries and contribute to global targets and create 
a vibrant new industry for the UK. 
CCUS represents an opportunity for investors to develop a new infrastructure at the core of a 
net zero economy that will provide income over the long-term as the industry develops. 
Government support for CCUS 
The Ten Point Plan, Energy White Paper5 and National Infrastructure Strategy6 set out the 
importance of CCUS in reaching net zero. The deployment of CCUS will be critical, enabling 
‘SuperPlaces’ that bring together renewable energy, CCUS, low carbon industry, and hydrogen 
production. We believe that this will create an attractive investment opportunity for the private 
sector, enabling the decarbonisation of these areas whilst also generating local and national 
economic benefits.  
To support deployment the government has allocated up to £1 billion through creation of the 
CIF. It has also committed to bring forward details in 2021 of a revenue mechanism to attract

private sector investment into ICC and hydrogen via our new business models to support these 
projects. 
Through our work on business models, we will create the sustainable commercial frameworks 
that investors need. Offshore wind deployment in the UK provides an example of how 
government action has encouraged the deployment of low carbon power generation activity, by 
stimulating new technologies and markets and bringing down costs. 
Alongside the new business models for CCUS, we will build on the UK’s global reputation for 
regulatory stability and transparency by establishing independent economic regulation for CO₂ 
T&S networks, enabling investors to earn a fair return under a predictable and stable 
framework and recognising that any economic regulator will have a duty under the relevant 
statutory provisions to ensure that investors can finance their activities and functions.  
Recognising the immature nature of CCUS in the UK, we acknowledge that there are inherent 
risks that currently the market is unable to price, or price efficiently. Where this is the case, 
they impact investment decisions. In recognition of this, we are working to develop an 
appropriate risk allocation framework to underpin the deployment of CCUS this decade.  
We want to ensure that the sector is set up for success to enable our ambition to deploy CCUS 
from the mid-2020s. That is why while the business models are being developed, through the 
Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) and Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge Fund 
(IDCF) we are providing £130 million of funding to support projects on front end project 
development activities such as planning, design, and preparation for project execution. This 
will help ensure that the early phase of prospective projects are deliverable and affordable 
before commitments to provide revenue support are made by the government. 
Our aim is to create a CCUS market that will provide investors with a fair return which 
recognises the nature of initial deployment. However, as the sector develops and confidence 
grows in the market, we would expect to see a reduction in the costs of deployment.  
CCUS Programme objectives 
With these factors in mind, business models have been developed with the following 
overarching objectives:  
• establishing a new CCUS sector; 
• enabling low cost decarbonisation in multiple sectors; and 
• developing a market for carbon capture 
Establishing a new CCUS sector 
We recognise that to attract investment there needs to be a clear and predictable framework 
for project developers and investors. Given the nature of CCUS deployment, there is a need 
for the government to address certain risks that the market, at this stage, would be unable to 
bear. In recognition of this, government support would take several forms including: 
 
12 
• direct capital contribution through the CIF; 
• a set of robust revenue mechanisms; 
• business models that support CO₂ capture; and 
• Economic Regulatory Regime (ERR) for T&S networks.  
Furthermore, a Government Support Package (GSP) is being contemplated that would seek to 
address high impact low probability risks for the T&S network such as stranded asset and 
defined CO₂ leakage risk from the storage facilities. It is intended that this will be structured in 
a way which overtime enables and stimulates market-based solutions to those risks, with the 
aim that the required level of support may be reduced.  
We expect elements of government support such as capital contributions and the GSP to 
evolve over time. For example, as the market builds confidence in CCUS project development 
and in the capture business models, we would expect the degree of government support would 
reduce in later CCUS projects. This means government capital contribution support may be 
most effective in early stages of the CCUS sector to kickstart the sector and build momentum 
and confidence in the sector. We need to further assess private sector risk appetite in order to 
make an assessment of the extent of necessary government intervention. 
Enabling low cost decarbonisation in multiple sectors  
CCUS can both play a critical role in the sustainability of UK industry and become a key 
contributor to the levelling up of the UK economy by enabling ‘SuperPlaces’, sharing common 
CO₂ T&S networks so as to enable key sectors to be competitive in a net zero economy.  
An integrated model will be designed to accommodate all relevant sectors and therefore be 
attractive to investors. CCUS also enables a source of low carbon power generation and 
hydrogen production, the latter of which can be used for various purposes across the 
economy. In order to achieve this, we are considering the following in the design of the 
business models:  
• reuse of existing assets and government capital contributions where appropriate; 
• efficient allocation of risk (i.e. risk allocated to the party most appropriate to manage it);  
• effective competition at appropriate stages, promoting clean growth whilst not damaging 
international competitiveness;  
• development of a model that will incentivise deployment of early projects, avoiding 
excessive costs for early users (via government capital contributions), whilst having the 
flexibility to evolve for later phases of deployment and being capable of supporting a 
range of projects across different industrial sectors; and  
• the realisation of benefits and sharing of knowledge across subsequent clusters as they 
are developed.  
 
 
 
13 
Developing a market for carbon capture  
When selecting initial clusters, we aim to establish ‘SuperPlaces’ to stimulate broader 
decarbonisation spill over benefits and then expand geographic reach beyond clusters over 
time. Intervention to support the development of a market for private sector investment 
includes the following: 
• a transparent process for the allocation of funding support; 
• creation of a new asset class with multiple investment entry points depending on risk 
appetite; 
• long-term inflation linked revenue streams which provide a predictable revenue profile 
over the life of an investment; 
• a stable and coherent regulatory regime with transparent guidance on the approach to 
regulatory decision making; and  
• a mechanism for enabling expansion of the T&S network to meet growing demand.  
Document Structure 
The remainder of this document explains how we have continued to develop the business 
models that seek to deliver our ambitions and objectives. A summary of each section is set out 
below.  
Section 3: CO₂ Transport and Storage Regulatory Investment (TRI) Business Model 
The development of T&S networks will be fundamental to the delivery of CCUS. Initially there 
will be a need for greater government intervention to support private sector investment in a 
new and nascent sector, including potentially ensuring that T&S networks are right-sized to 
accommodate expected future growth in CO₂ volumes captured for storage. The regulatory 
framework will support a stable, predictable, and index-linked model which will underpin 
investor returns, so that carbon capture can play a role in the UK’s economy for decades to 
come supported, where needed, by appropriate levels of government intervention.  
Section 4: Dispatchable Power Agreement (DPA) for Power CCUS 
We have designed the DPA business model to incentivise a power CCUS plant to operate in a 
dispatchable mode, where the plant should be incentivised to react to market prices and 
generate during periods where this is required to meet demand. Conversely, this means that 
the plant should reduce generation output during periods of low prices, and should not displace 
low cost, low carbon generation capacity such as renewables or nuclear. The flexibility of 
power CCUS should allow it to complement the intermittency of renewables by adjusting output 
to meet changes in electricity demand whilst still capturing emissions from generation. Section 
4 sets out how the business model has been designed to create an attractive investment 
proposition in CCUS power.  
 
14 
Section 5: Industrial Carbon Capture (ICC) Contract for Industrial Carbon Capture 
The proposed ICC business model has been designed to incentivise the deployment of carbon 
capture technology for industrial users who often have no other option to achieve deep 
decarbonisation. We expect the model to proceed with an ICC Contract which covers 
operational expenses, T&S fees and rate of return on capital investment, with an element of 
capital co-funding for initial projects. This is intended for first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects and we 
expect it to evolve as the technology and investment confidence matures. In the long-term we 
anticipate a competitive allocation process and a market-driven carbon price to promote 
permanent CO₂ abatement. In Section 5, we set out our ‘minded-to’ position on the commercial 
concept to incentivise ICC in the UK, funding mechanisms to deliver early ICC projects and 
detail on key commercial policy terms for inclusion in our proposed ICC Contract. 
Section 6: Low Carbon Hydrogen 
This section provides an update on the government’s approach to addressing policy 
development relating to low carbon hydrogen business models. This builds on the response to 
the previous CCUS business models consultation that included a chapter on hydrogen and the 
Frontier Economics report on low carbon hydrogen production business models, published in 
August 20207. The update notes our intention to support the development of both  
CCUS-enabled and electrolytic hydrogen production technologies, key considerations relating 
to policy development, and our preference at this stage for contractual over regulatory support 
mechanisms for large scale hydrogen production. We will consult on our preferred hydrogen 
business models in 2021.

Section 3: CO₂ Transport and Storage 
Regulatory Investment Model 
Introduction 
The T&S business model (‘TRI Model’) is based on an economic regulation funding model. 
This approach seeks to balance the need to provide long term confidence to investors with 
predictable and stable returns within a broadly bounded range. The features set out below are 
derived from a range of precedents including utility regulation. We have sought to consider 
how the framework can be best adapted to projects with the characteristics of CCUS 
infrastructure and will be refining and developing the approach further based on engagement 
with key stakeholders including project developers and potential investors.  
This chapter is structured to cover the following elements of the TRI Model: 
• the objectives of the TRI Model; 
• revenue model; 
• ERR; 
• GSP; and 
• consideration of risks. 
We envisage that Transport and Storage Company (T&SCo) will be responsible for the 
development, construction, financing, operation, maintenance, expansion, and 
decommissioning of the T&S network. We will continue to give consideration of the ownership 
model of the T&SCo as consulted in summer 2019. It will be responsible for the plant, 
equipment, and operational resources required to ensure that the transportation and long-term 
storage of CO₂ is safe, efficient, and compliant with defined requirements. We have outlined 
T&SCo’s key roles below and note that further work is required to refine the roles of asset 
owner and system operator including the following: 
• Asset Owner: T&SCo will own the onshore and offshore network, and obtain the 
licence for the storage site; and 
• System Operator: T&SCo will operate the T&S network to ensure the operational 
parameters are within specified limits, manage network access, perform network 
planning, and administrate sector specific tasks (such as relevant connection codes). 
As part of delivering these roles, we envisage T&SCo would review the CO₂ metering and 
compositional analysis equipment installed by the users at the point of connection. T&SCo 
would be responsible for health, safety, and environmental compliance related to the T&S 
network.  
 
16 
Objectives of the TRI Model 
We believe that T&S networks represent a unique investment opportunity to support the UK’s 
green industrial revolution and enable the transition to net zero carbon emissions, as outlined 
in Box 1 below.  
Box 1: The CCUS T&S network investment proposition 
An Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) focused opportunity… 
• CCUS is essential to achieve the UK’s net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.  
• The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) project that by 2050 storage of 70 to 180 
MtCO₂ per year will be needed in 2050,8 highlighting the expected scale of demand 
for T&S networks.  
• In addition to transporting and storing CO₂ captured in the UK, the T&S network has 
the potential to benefit from global decarbonisation agenda through the provision of 
a decarbonisation service (i.e. storage of CO₂) to other countries. 
… with the potential to contribute to economic growth… 
• A T&S network holds the key to unlocking clean growth potential in the UK and to 
levelling up opportunities. 
• Establishing T&S networks provides a strategic opportunity for other sectors to use 
their skills and expertise to drive the energy transition.  
• Furthermore, T&S networks provide an opportunity to leverage delivery expertise in 
construction and position the UK as a market leader in CCUS supply chain, 
procurement, and construction management services.  
… in a strategic sector with potential growth… 
• T&S networks will attract investment from a wider pool of capital as technological 
feasibility and financial sustainability are established. Creating T&S networks will 
unlock strategic opportunities such as industrial decarbonisation, blue hydrogen, and 
power CCUS, and enhance the resilience of existing commodity value chains. 
• T&S networks have significant opportunities in the future to expand their network 
and hence asset base to meet a growing demand of their services as part of the net 
zero transition. 
… underpinned by a robust policy and regulatory framework  
• T&S investors will receive a long-term inflation linked revenue stream, providing 
investors with revenue and cash flow predictability. Revenue will be paid by T&S

users that are in receipt of an ICC Contract or DPA to begin with, providing further 
confidence in the reliability of the revenue stream. 
• Allowed revenues will be determined based on efficient and economic costs incurred 
and consideration of events within T&SCo reasonable control.  
• The independent economic regulator (the Regulator) will operate and exercise its 
functions within a defined regulatory framework, including a duty to ensure that an 
efficient T&SCo can finance its operation and to support delivery of Government’s 
objectives for CCUS deployment. Regulatory guidance will be provided to clarify 
how the Regulator intends to approach any regulatory decision making providing 
greater visibility to investors. 
• T&SCo investors will earn returns that are commensurate with the risks that they 
bear, with an opportunity to earn additional returns when outperforming target 
performance. 
• T&SCo investors will be incentivised to maintain the availability of the T&S network 
and attract new users to connect to the T&S network. The design of such an 
incentive to attract new users will be further considered to take into account what is 
in the control of T&SCo.  
  
We have developed the TRI Model to unlock investment in T&S networks and deliver our 
objectives for the CCUS programme (as set out in Section 2). We have drawn on learnings 
from other industries (e.g. regulated utilities), the government’s former CCS Commercialisation 
competition, international programmes, recommendations from the CCUS Advisory Group 
(CAG), and our consultation on CCUS business models.  
Our key objectives for the TRI Model and their implications for the design of the TRI Model are 
discussed below. 
• Attracting investment in the T&S network to establish a new CCUS sector 
In order to establish a commercial framework that enables and supports stable investment in 
projects that are likely to have long operating lives, it is vital that suitable financing structures 
and funding structures are developed. This will ensure that investors have clear sight of the 
long-term revenue model to ensure they can earn a reasonable regulated return on their 
investment.  
• Enabling low cost decarbonisation in multiple sectors 
Each T&S network must be able to accommodate multiple and different types of users with 
varying demand profiles and be sufficiently flexible to implement various potential network 
designs and growth profiles. Developers, investors, and users of T&S networks need visibility 
over the allocation of T&S specific risks such as stranded asset risks, varying build out rates 
between a capture plant and T&S network and potential long-term storage leaks.  
 
18 
We understand the importance of balancing the need for anticipatory investment to address 
future demand on the T&S network with the economic attractiveness of the network to near 
term users. We will also consider how T&SCo can be incentivised to attract more users to their 
T&S network in support of decarbonisation. 
• Developing a market for carbon capture – a long-term vision 
The Regulator will administer the ERR and ensure that costs are economic and efficient whilst 
also incentivising T&SCo to attract more users into the T&S network to drive higher utilisation 
and therefore spread the costs and benefit from economies of scale. The ERR would be 
designed to have sufficient flexibility to allow for future CO₂ market expansion (potentially 
including shipped CO₂) whilst ensuring affordability and VfM for the users.  
Design implications 
For T&SCo to attract stable investment, the TRI Model needs to recognise that the investment 
proposition will evolve as the T&S network moves through different stages/phases of the 
project/asset lifecycle and as the CCUS market develops. For initial T&S projects in the UK we: 
• believe that the construction of the T&S network requires that techniques and skills tried 
and tested in other sectors are applied in a new sector;  
• consider the construction phase as the period between Final Investment Decision (FID) 
and end of commissioning of the T&S network (i.e. Commercial Operational Date 
(COD)) unless otherwise stated; 
• assume the risk profile will change in the post-construction phase, once operation of the 
T&S network and the resulting revenue streams are well established; and 
• assume the risk profile during the steady state operational phase for T&SCo will be 
comparable with but may not be identical to the ongoing operation of other network 
assets.  
The engagement with stakeholders to date has identified a number of characteristics of CCUS 
deployment which need to be addressed in developing a sustainable business model 
(discussed below). The objective of the outline TRI Model in this document is to provide a 
framework for addressing these risks. The risk allocation in the business model will inform the 
level of potential returns available for the construction and operation of the infrastructure.  
We will continue to assess risk appetite of various sources of finance in order to make an 
assessment of the extent of necessary government intervention during the early period of 
CCUS deployment.  
Benefits of the TRI Model 
In achieving the aforementioned objectives, the TRI Model has the benefit of being able to 
address the following risks to provide greater investment confidence: 
 
19 
• revenue risks: uncertain demand and potentially a small userbase initially means that 
T&SCo may face a higher degree of underutilisation and counterparty risks than existing 
gas and electricity networks; 
• user timing mismatch risk: we envisage CO₂ capture and T&S projects being 
developed simultaneously, which means there is a risk that anticipated early users may 
connect to the T&S network later than planned; and 
• CO₂ leakage risk: the long-term storage of CO₂ and the low probability of leaks from 
the store give rise to some unique risks for T&SCo. 
Noting the objectives and challenges outlined previously, and building on the government’s 
response to the consultation on potential business models for CCUS published in August 2020, 
this section sets out the government’s latest position on the following elements of the TRI 
Model including: 
• revenue model: a route for T&S fees to be collected from users of the T&S network and 
potential recourse to consumers and taxpayers in limited circumstances; 
• ERR: a framework set out in the licence for determining the allowed revenue including 
return to T&SCo. This would be based on efficient and economic costs incurred by 
T&SCo in respect of its duties and outputs and subject to appropriate performance 
targets underpinned by appropriate risk allocation between T&SCo and the users; and 
• GSP: a package providing protection, through a set of contractual arrangements for 
investors and users against specific high impact low probability risks. 
Details of each element are described below. The section concludes by outlining how the 
proposed TRI Model delivers the government’s objectives, including how it addresses the key 
challenges to a successful TRI Model. 
Revenue model 
The User Pays revenue model 
We believe that the revenue stream for T&SCo needs to: 
• provide confidence to investors that it is a reliable way to channel revenue so that 
T&SCo is able to finance its functions;  
• provide a predictable cost allocation which is commensurate with capacity and volume 
to ensure that those who use or directly benefit from the T&S network make payments 
to T&SCo for doing so; and 
• enable future users to join the T&S network and be flexible in response to how markets 
might change in the future. 
The proposed revenue model for T&SCo is a User Pays model. Under this model, T&SCo’s 
revenue stream will be made up of payments from those who use the T&S network to have 
their captured CO₂ transported and stored. T&SCo would also have contingent recourse to 
 
20 
consumers and/or taxpayer support to ensure the revenue stream from users is predictable 
and robust from a financing perspective. This is covered in further detail below.  
The User Pays model can also be extended to accommodate the import of CO₂ from sources 
external to the T&S network (i.e. by injecting CO₂ at a T&S network or storage access point) or 
enable the reuse of CO₂ in the future, (i.e. those who connect to the T&S network to offtake 
CO₂ will make payments to T&SCo too).  
Figure 1 an illustration of the User Pays revenue model in the steady state operational phase 
and associated assumptions are set out below 
 
* LCCC is being considered as a potential counterparty.  
** Revenue models for ‘blue’ hydrogen and negative emissions (i.e. bioenergy and direct air 
capture) under development. 
The User Pays model consists of the following elements: 
• T&S fees: fees that are paid by users to T&SCo for using the T&S network and storage 
site; 
• DPA revenue and ICC Contract revenue: power and industrial users of the T&S 
network who have entered into DPA and ICC Contract will be entitled to revenue under 
those contracts. See Sections 4 and 5 for further details about the DPA and ICC 
Contract respectively. The contract price would take account of the cost of the T&S fees 
through indexation; and  
• consumer payments and taxpayer payments: for example, consumers and taxpayers 
will ultimately contribute to the cost of the DPA and ICC Contract, or directly through the 
 
21 
TRI Model in the event of contingent resource being required in certain limited 
circumstances. 
T&S fees 
The allowed revenue would be determined under the ERR under the economic licence and 
largely represents the cost of establishing and operating the T&S network including any 
incentives. Further details of the ERR are set up in section below. 
Once the allowed revenue is established, T&SCo will collect its revenue through T&S fees paid 
by users of the T&S network. We expect the T&S fees will be determined using a methodology 
initially developed by the government and the Regulator, informed by a set of guiding principles 
and in consultation with industry. We expect T&SCo would administrate the methodology in the 
future once the CCUS sector is established, including making updates to the methodology in 
consultation with users and seeking ultimate approval from the Regulator (this is similar to 
practices in other regulated network sectors such as gas and electricity). In addition, T&SCo 
would have contingent recourse to taxpayers and/or consumers if there is a revenue gap to 
ensure that T&SCo would receive income at the level of allowed revenue. 
Further work will be undertaken on the design of the T&S fees that all users will pay, but it 
could be structured similarly to gas network charges and include the following elements: 
Potential elements of the T&S fees 
The inclusion of a capacity component and a volumetric component within the overall T&S fees 
is important to reflect the fact that T&SCo will incur both costs driven by the capacity of the 
T&S network and costs driven by the volume of the CO₂ transported and stored. Similarly, the 
inclusion of a connection fee is important to reflect the specific cost associated with connecting 
a user (or a group of users) at that specific location when the T&S network and its userbase is 
expanding. 
Establishing a robust revenue model 
The User Pays model will be a sustainable revenue model for T&SCo once the CCUS cluster 
has matured (i.e. in a steady state operational phase), as is the case for gas and electricity 
networks. However, we recognise that there are a number of areas where T&SCo may be 
 
22 
exposed to risk which need to be considered in developing a robust revenue model. These are 
considered further below:  
a) utilisation build-up during the early operational phase; 
b) timing mismatch of when capture projects connect; 
c) underutilisation of the network; and 
d) bad debt of users. 
The model includes various measures such as a contingent funding mechanism from 
consumers and taxpayers in the event of non-payment by users of the network.  
a) Utilisation build-up during the early operational phase 
It is likely that the T&S network would initially be sized to take account of future users joining 
the T&S network and to retain the benefit of economies of scale. We expect users will be 
scheduled to join the T&S network in phases with the result that initially, the T&S network will 
not be fully utilised.  
This means that if initial users pay T&S fees that reflect the proportion of their use of the T&S 
network, the amount of revenue that T&SCo collects during the early operational phase could 
be less than its total allowed revenue (as illustrated in the diagram below) for the T&S network 
as a whole. This is because a proportion of the T&S network capacity will not be used and no 
user will be charged for that proportion, yet T&SCo will still incur costs related to that 
proportion of T&S network capacity, (e.g. finance and maintenance costs). This creates a 
potential revenue gap. 
Figure 2: illustration of the impact of planned underutilisation during early operational phase 
 
In order to close this potential “revenue gap” between T&SCo’s total allowed revenue and the 
revenue it collects from users, the government is considering the following list of potential 
options – which are not intended to be mutually exclusive nor is this an exhaustive list of 
potential options: 
 
23 
• upfront capital contribution through the CIF: the provision of upfront capital funding 
through the CIF would reduce the capital cost incurred by T&SCo which it has to 
finance, and in turn this would reduce T&SCo’s annual revenue required. We are 
considering the different forms of government capital through the CIF;  
• TRI Model design: the allowed revenue profile overtime could be shaped to match the 
expected utilisation profile of the T&S network, i.e. deferring revenue from the early 
operational phase to later in the operational phase. For example, we are considering the 
potential for profiling of the depreciation of the regulated asset value (RAV) (as is the 
case for gas distribution networks under the RIIO regulatory regime), as opposed to 
using straight-line depreciation. Similarly, the decommissioning accrual profile could be 
profiled instead of using a straight-line subject to further work as part of wider CCUS 
decommissioning policy development;  
• T&SCo’s utilisation incentive: the ERR may contain incentives for T&SCo to find 
and/or connect more users to the T&S network, in addition to the anchor projects9. 
Calibration of the incentive would require further consideration including government 
support on capture projects recognising limitation on T&SCo’s control; and 
• contingent mechanism: if the proposals described above were not sufficient to enable 
T&SCo to recover its allowed revenue, we will explore the potential for consumers or 
taxpayers to pay for any remaining under recovery of allowed revenue. 
b) User timing mismatch risk – Anchor project does not connect on time 
T&SCo will only receive revenue from users when they connect to the T&S network and so no 
T&S fees are payable by users until the first user is connected.  
The risk that the first user(s) does not connect to the T&S network when expected, i.e. its 
connection is delayed (referred to as “user timing mismatch risk”). If this risk were to 
materialise T&SCo would not begin to earn revenue when expected. This would create a 
potential revenue gap equal to T&SCo’s lost revenues due to the delay in the user joining the 
T&S network and lead to a potential cashflow shortfall. This is because T&SCo will still incur 
costs such as finance costs, salaries, and some supply chain cost, despite no T&S fees being 
collected from users. 
Once a user is connected to the T&S network the risk of timing mismatch dissipates as T&SCo 
will begin collecting revenue. Beyond the first user, subsequent users failing to connect would 
be treated as an underutilisation event, discussed further below. 
We expect support from the government for the development of a cluster would be allocated 
on the basis of information provided by T&SCo with regards to the timing of connection, 
especially on the timing of anchor users. However, we understand that T&SCo generally does 
not have significant influence over user’s construction or retrofitting programme. As such it is 
considered that T&SCo should be provided with protection in the event this timing mismatch 
risk materialises. However, in exchange for this protection, there will need to be some form of 
 
9 Anchor projects are capture projects that will be confirmed as the first users of the network when the T&S 
network is being constructed 
 
24 
incentive to bring on the anchor users proposed by T&SCo. The nature of this incentive and 
how it should be calibrated requires further consideration.  
In order to reduce the “revenue gap” that would result if the timing mismatch risk were realised, 
the government is considering the following list of potential options – which are not intended to 
be mutually exclusive nor is this an exhaustive list of potential options: 
• Rolled Up Interest (RUI): the return and depreciation that T&SCo would have been 
able to collect as part of its allowed revenue if the first user had connected to the T&S 
network on time could be deferred and “rolled up” into the allowed revenue that T&SCo 
can recover across the remaining operational life of the T&S network. This mechanism 
would be in place until a user connects to the T&S network;  
• recovery of operating expenditure (opex): T&SCo’s opex (which is determined to be 
efficient by the Regulator) will be paid for each year until a user connects to the T&S 
network. The opex could be paid for by consumers or taxpayers, for example, if a power 
user was supposed to connect first, consumers would pay the opex. We are considering 
the feasibility of this proposal, noting it would have implications for the design of the 
DPA and ICC Contract for industrial capture projects and we will continue to review this 
option. We are also considering the feasibility of payment from the delayed user (e.g. 
power project or Industrial Capture project) to contribute towards opex;  
• incentivising T&SCo to present a robust cluster plan: the allowed revenue could be 
reduced as part of the incentive regime under the ERR until the proposed anchor users 
are connected to the T&S network; and 
• contingent mechanism: if the proposals described above were not sufficient to enable 
T&SCo to recover its allowed revenue, we will explore the potential for consumers or 
taxpayers to pay for any remaining under recovery of allowed revenue. 
Users will also be incentivised to connect to the T&S network as planned through the DPA and 
ICC Contract for power and industry users, respectively. For example, the DPA contains 
provisions to incentivise the commencement of operations within a specific window, with 
delays impacting on the term of the DPA. 
c) Underutilisation risk  
Once the first ‘anchor’ project has connected to the T&S network, the T&S network could still 
risk being underutilised if: an expected user does not connect (on time or at all); a user 
disconnects earlier than expected; or connected users do not inject as much CO₂ into the T&S 
network as expected. 
As T&SCo will collect its revenue largely through the T&S fees, which is expected to include a 
capacity fee and a volumetric fee, any underutilisation will result in T&SCo receiving income 
less than the allowed revenue leading to a potential revenue gap. 
This risk could potentially materialise during the operational life of the T&S network. However, 
the revenue gap that results from any underutilisation may be more significant in the early 
 
25 
operational phase compared to in the steady state operational phase, as the loss of any 
revenue from a small user base could represent a larger proportion of total expected revenue. 
T&SCo does not have the ability to require local emitters to join the T&S network. On that 
basis, it would be appropriate that T&SCo should be provided with protection in the event this 
risk materialises. However, we believe T&SCo could facilitate more emitters to connect to the 
T&S network through promoting the T&S network and proactive engagement with potential 
users including overseas opportunities.  
In order to address the “revenue gap” that would result if the underutilisation risk were realised, 
the government is considering the following list of potential options – which are not intended to 
be mutually exclusive nor is this an exhaustive list of potential options: 
• building a financial reserve: a financial reserve would be included as part of the 
allowed revenue. The reserve could be held in a ring-fenced account and potentially be 
used for mitigation of other risks such as unplanned outage and CO₂ leakage; 
• mutualisation over the remaining userbase: T&S fees for remaining users of the T&S 
network would be increased in order to close the revenue gap. A user’s DPA or ICC 
Contract would be indexed to the T&S fees. This mechanism is more suitable in the 
steady state operational phase when there will be a larger user base over which to 
mutualise the revenue gap, compared to in the early operational phase;  
• T&SCo’s utilisation incentive: the Regulator is expected to provide an incentive to the 
T&SCo to connect more users to the T&S network (refer to the ERR subsection for 
further detail). If the utilisation is below a set target, T&SCo allowed revenue could be 
reduced as part of the incentive regime. Calibration of the incentive would require 
further consideration including government support on capture projects recognising 
limitation on T&SCo’s control; and 
• a contingent mechanism: if the proposals described above were not sufficient to 
enable T&SCo to recover its allowed revenue, we will explore the potential for 
consumers or taxpayers to pay for any remaining under recovery of allowed revenue. 
Figure 3: illustration of how the “revenue gap” could be addressed if there is underutilisation 
 
 
26 
* A user’s ICC Contract and DPA will be adjusted to cover the cost of any of these proposals 
being adopted  
d) Bad debt risk (non-payment) 
Bad debt risk arises when there are unforeseen delays in payment of T&S fees or 
non-payment by users10 (e.g. insolvency of a user). This could result in a revenue gap.  
This risk can be realised at any point during the operational life of the T&S network. However, 
the revenue gap that results from any bad debt may be more significant in the early operational 
phase compared to in the steady state operational phase, as the loss of any revenue from the 
small user base could represent a larger proportion of total expected revenue. 
The likelihood of this risk materialising in the early operational phase may be mitigated 
somewhat as it is expected that most users of the T&S network will receive DPA revenue or 
ICC Contract revenue for a period of time, which will cover the costs of the T&S fees.  
T&SCo will not have control over the financial operations of users and T&SCo should be 
provided some protection in the event this risk materialises. In order to reduce the “revenue 
gap” that would result if the bad debt risk were realised, the government is considering the 
following list of potential options – which are not intended to be mutually exclusive nor is this 
an exhaustive list of potential options: 
• collateral: users of the T&S network could be required to post collateral equal to a 
certain percentage of their expected annual T&S fees or users could buy insurance (if 
available) against not being able to pay T&S fees. T&SCo would use the collateral that 
has been posted or the money paid out from the insurance policy to close the revenue 
gap. The right size of collateral or the appropriate insurance policy requires further 
consideration;  
• bad debt allowance: the ERR would include a “use it or lose it” bad debt allowance in 
the calculation for T&SCo’s allowed revenue. T&SCo would use the allowance to close 
the revenue gap if instances of bad debt arise, but they would not be able to use the 
allowance otherwise. The right size bad debt allowance required may be based on 
practice in other sectors;  
• mutualisation over the remaining userbase: T&S fees for users of the T&S network 
(including any user that has not been paying their T&S fees) could be increased in order 
to close the revenue gap. A user’s DPA or ICC Contract would be indexed to the T&S 
fees. This mechanism is more suitable in the steady state operational phase, compared 
to in the early operational phase; and 
• contingent mechanism: if the proposals described above were not sufficient to enable 
T&SCo to recover its allowed revenue, we will explore the potential for consumers or 
taxpayers to pay for any remaining under recovery of allowed revenue.

Economic Regulatory Regime (ERR) 
The ERR is a framework that provides an annual allowed revenue to T&SCo, reflecting 
efficient costs and a reasonable rate of return. As well as containing the measures described 
above, it is also envisaged that the ERR may also include a suite of performance targets 
(‘outputs’) and mechanisms (‘incentives’) to allocate and manage risks. It is envisaged that the 
ERR will establish the overall framework that sets the allowed revenues and defines T&SCo’s 
business activities monitored by the Regulator through regular price controls. The features 
outlined below are based on a number of precedents including utility regulation with adaptions 
for CCUS. 
The following content sets out the key building blocks of the ERR, covering the construction 
phase and operational phase. 
1. Economic Regulator (“the Regulator”) 
The Regulator’s role is to establish the ERR that provides the framework for T&SCo to earn 
revenues for the services it provides to users. Administrative fees for the Regulator would be 
paid by T&SCo and from revenues collected from users and potentially consumers and 
taxpayers.  
In practical terms this means that:  
• an independent body (the Regulator) would be established in statute to regulate the 
T&S sector, and its duties and objectives would be prescribed in legislation; 
• the Regulator would be able to authorise (via a licence) T&S network companies, in this 
case T&SCo, to perform certain activities for certain users – which would be defined 
through a price control process; and 
• a licenced T&SCo would be authorised to charge its network users for the services it 
provides.  
 
28 
The duties and objectives of the Regulator are being considered further but could include 
duties for the Regulator to protect the interests of current and future users of the T&S network, 
to enable an economic and efficient T&SCo to finance its activities and to support the 
deployment of CCUS to meet governments Net Zero target. The Regulator is obliged to act in 
line with its statutory duties and obligations. The Regulator would develop full detail on the 
licence and building blocks of the business model, ahead of a FID to provide clarity and 
transparency to T&SCo, users and investors. Furthermore, the Regulator will develop a 
guidance to clarify its approach to the ERR (an example of this type of guidance can be 
observed in Ofwat’s guidance for Thames Tideway Tunnel)11.  
2. Periodic price controls 
Periodic price controls are the framework of rules that determine T&SCo’s activities, the level 
of service expected and the allowed efficient and economic costs. The allowed revenue would 
be collected from users through T&S fees and potentially consumers and taxpayers. The 
approved price control settlement would offer revenue certainty to T&SCo over the duration of 
the relevant settlement period subject to system availability and pre-defined revenue 
adjustments.  
The duration of each price control is being considered further. During the price control period, 
in addition to some parameters of allowed revenue which are indexed, there may be a set of 
very limited and defined in-period reopeners for elements that could not be efficiently estimated 
during the price control review or for Force Majeure type events.  
3. Allowed revenue 
The allowed revenue is the revenue to which T&SCo is entitled in each year of the price control 
period to fund T&SCo’s activities. The allowed revenue is a function of a number of ‘building 
blocks’ as set out below: 
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴 = (𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑥𝑥 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅) + 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟 + 𝑂𝑂𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑥𝑥 + 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷 +  𝑇𝑇𝐷𝐷𝑥𝑥 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 
• RWACC: the Regulated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (RWACC) during operations 
to compensate T&SCo for the cost of capital investment. RWACC is discussed in more 
detail below;  
• RAV: returns to T&SCo’s debt and equity investors would be provided through a RAV x 
WACC building block based on established regulatory precedent. The RAV is the 
efficiently incurred capital investment into the project including construction, asset 
expansion and a ‘rolled up’ cost of capital (i.e. Interest During Construction (IDC)). RAV 
is discussed in more detail below; 
• Depreciation: the revenue collected from users to cover asset depreciation over the 
operational period. This could be profiled to reduce payments early in the early 
operational period to support the initial stages of the project; 
 
11 https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/publication/ofwat-guidance-on-approach-to-the-economic-regulation-of-the-
infrastructure-provider-for-the-thames-tideway-tunnel/  
 
29 
• Decom: an allowance to cover the decommissioning cost of the T&S network at the end 
asset life (see further explanation on the proposed decommissioning regime below); and 
• Adjustments: items that adjust the allowed revenue and includes pass-through costs 
(e.g. insurance costs), any required true-ups and incentives such as for leakage, timely 
connections and availability. 
Decommissioning (includes monitoring) 
T&SCo, as with other infrastructure owners in the oil and gas sector, is responsible for 
decommissioning activities at the end of the project’s life. These may include asset removal, 
sealing wells, and monitoring the integrity of the CO₂ store. Decommissioning activities would 
be subject to regulatory and government scrutiny, and international obligations such as the 
Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR 
Convention) Decision 98/3.  
Decommissioning costs are allowed as part of the building blocks forming the allowed revenue. 
The money collected for decommissioning would build up a reserve over the operational period 
following a short period after COD. T&SCo would be required to ring-fence the 
decommissioning revenues to meet the future decommissioning obligation. We are considering 
further how to address a potential shortfall in the decommissioning reserve if there is an early 
closure of the T&S network, as part of wider CCUS decommissioning regime work. 
Where existing oil and gas assets are transferred into the TRI Model for CCUS application, the 
total decommissioning liability would be separated into two components: i) non-CCUS 
decommissioning liability for hydrocarbon extraction-related activities and ii) decommissioning 
liability associated with re-use or modification for CCUS activities. The TRI Model would only 
fund the decommissioning liability related to CCUS activities, as is the case for new build T&S 
assets. We are considering how the non-CCUS decommissioning liability would be covered as 
part of wider reuse transfer.  
We will undertake further work to develop a holistic decommissioning regime for the CCUS 
sector and consult the proposed design in 2021. 
RAV 
The RAV is a regulatory construct that reflects T&SCo investment. It is calculated as follows: 
𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷 𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑒𝑒𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴) = ∑ 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑥𝑥 + ∑ 𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑥𝑥 + ∑ 𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷𝑅𝑅 − ∑ 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟  
It is considered that these investments would be established in real terms (with inflation 
factored into their values) and on a cumulative basis (e.g. cumulative capex). Practically this 
means an inflation uplift is added to the revenues. Development expenditure (Devex) is 
development spend and capex is capital spend.  
The Regulator would verify the opening RAV for the beginning of the operational phase 
following successful commissioning of the T&S network. We are considering the feasibility of a 
combined ex-ante and ex-post assessment of the construction for the same project. 
 
30 
• Ex-ante assessment of the construction of transport facilities: the Regulator would 
perform an ex-ante assessment of T&SCo’s proposed costs for the transport facilities 
and set a base case to inform the starting RAV before FID. A post-construction review 
would be performed by the Regulator to adjust the associated transport assets RAV 
under a very limited and defined set of conditions that are considered outside of 
T&SCo’s reasonable control. 
• Ex-post assessment of the construction of storage facilities: the Regulator would 
assess the efficiency of T&SCo’s spend on storage facilities on an ex-post basis. This is 
because construction of storage facilities could have a high degree of uncertainty, 
compared to the transport facilities. T&SCo could price in significant risk contingency if 
the construction cost were to be estimated on an ex-ante basis, potentially leading to an 
overall higher cost to the users. 
The assessment would not be a simple pass-through and the Regulator would not allow 
any non-economic or efficient costs to be logged into the RAV. The Regulator would 
seek to provide a base expectation at the start of construction, or assessment principles 
for interpreting what is considered as an efficient and economic cost, to support 
developers in managing the construction programme under an ex-post assessment. As 
with interconnectors and Offshore Transmission Owner (OFTO) regime, the timing of 
this ex-post assessment could be near construction completion, though the final actual 
value will depend on the spend profile and time required for the assessment.  
• Ex-post assessment of transferred existing assets for CCUS application: assets 
previously deployed in the oil and gas industry may be utilised/transferred as part of 
setting up the CCUS T&S network to save costs from building a new T&S network. As 
the asset is already largely constructed, the capital expenditure-based methodology for 
determining RAV as described in the above bullet points would not be suitable to be 
applied directly on the transferred assets. We are considering the methodology for 
determining the transferred assets RAV and would provide an update to the proposed 
methodology in 2021.  
• Interest During Construction (IDC): 
𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷𝑅𝑅 = (𝐵𝐵𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑥𝑥 ∑ (𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅 𝐷𝐷𝑟𝑟 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟 𝐷𝐷ℎ𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴)) + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 
as the T&SCo would not receive revenue until successful commissioning of the T&S 
network, IDC represents an accrued interest on the capital investment in the 
construction phase and would be ‘rolled up’ during construction and added to the 
opening RAV. BWACC is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) during the 
construction phase of the project and RAV is the efficient and economic capital 
expenditure in the construction phase.  
During the operational phase, the RAV would be adjusted to account for further asset 
expansion. It is likely that T&SCo will need to expand the initial T&S network during the 
operational phase to connect new users or construct new storage assets. The Regulator will 
provide ex-ante allowances during the periodic price control process for upcoming 
construction. Where there is uncertainty, the Regulator may use various uncertainty 
 
31 
mechanisms to ensure T&SCo and users are not unnecessarily exposed to risks of excessive 
gains or losses, such as the use of reopeners or potentially volume drivers. 
WACC 
The WACC (including RWACC and BWACC) building block represents the remuneration to the 
T&SCo for the capital investment into the T&S network. The risks of investing in T&SCo may 
vary over time depending on the project’s risk profile and we expect that RWACC would likely 
be different from BWACC. 
We are considering whether BWACC would be set through competition or, more likely for early 
projects, a bespoke process to provide a fair rate of return to investors for the risks they bear.  
A number of factors influence the setting of both BWACC and RWACC including benchmarking 
where possible of analogous industries with similar levels of risk and reward. The process 
would also need to have regard to T&S Co’s ability to finance its operations and deliver on any 
other duties set by the Regulator.  
RWACC would be set periodically by the Regulator through the operational price control review 
process (described above) and similarly to BWACC, the Regulator would take into account 
T&SCo’s financeability in setting RWACC along with any other duties and the associated 
guidance. Other factors typically used in setting RWACC include notional gearing levels, cost 
of capital (both debt and equity), and any adjustments for additional risks.  
We will consider further the methodology for setting BWACC and RWACC next year. In 
particular, we will consider how best to mitigate any uncertainties in the underlying 
assumptions and parameters to provide investors with visibility as T&SCo progresses from 
construction into the steady-state operational phase.  
Refinancing 
Following successful commissioning of the T&S network, T&SCo may look to refinance the 
project. The Regulator would undertake careful consideration of the refinancing opportunity in 
setting RWACC to balance between potential excessive profit and financeability. The 
government is considering the following options (which need not be mutually exclusive):  
• duty to ensure financeability and guidance: we expect the Regulator would have a 
duty to ensure an efficient licensee is able to finance the activities in the economic 
licence. This is similar to other regulated utilities. The Regulator will also set out 
guidance on its approach to regulatory decision making which should provide additional 
clarity to T&SCo; 
• independent dispute resolution: if the T&SCo were to challenge the Regulator’s 
decision, it may require the Regulator to refer the matter to an independent body. This 
would provide an independent dispute resolution route if T&SCo considered the 
regulatory settlement is inappropriate; 
 
32 
• extension of BWACC: the BWACC may be extended into a period following COD 
drawing on precedents such as Thames Tideway Tunnel project specifically only in this 
context. This would provide certainty to T&SCo on the cost of capital until a time where 
the cluster is likely to be more established (e.g. successful operation of the T&S network 
as designed, a robust userbase where revenue risks are reduced etc). BWACC in this 
case would be a blended WACC reflecting the degree of risks borne by the T&SCo in 
the construction and operational phase; 
• gain share mechanism: a reopener may be established to share the benefits of 
refinancing with users. The actual calibration of the gain share mechanism would be 
explored further to achieve the balance between preventing excessive profit and 
incentivising T&SCo to seek lower cost of capital; and/or 
• actual gearing: the Regulator could set the RWACC based on actual financial gearing 
ratio of the T&SCo in the early operational phase. This could potentially limit the 
incentive for T&SCo to seek cheaper sources of capital where it is available. 
 
4. Managing risk through efficient allocation, outputs and incentives  
T&S networks are likely to have similar characteristics to other networks which are also subject 
to economic regulation. As with other networks, in order to encourage companies to innovate 
so they become more efficient, to minimise costs to consumers and taxpayers and invest for 
future needs, we believe there is value in establishing appropriate incentives. Similar to other 
regulated sectors, we consider that establishing a robust set of performance incentives for 
T&SCo would drive better outcomes for users, taxpayers, and consumers. 
The Regulator would set a series of key outputs and incentives through the ERR to help 
ensure T&SCo delivers an economic and efficient service to users and to allocate risks 
between different users. All cost incurred by T&SCo would be linked to specific outputs to 
ensure a clear traceability between users’ cost and benefits that users receive through the 
actions of the T&SCo.  
The section below describes a number of the key outputs and incentives covering the early 
phases of the T&S network. These along with other outputs and incentives, will be developed 
and tested further.  
We divide the key risks, outputs and incentives into construction and operation phases. 
Construction phase: 
a) Incentive to manage construction cost of the transport network 
T&SCo would be responsible for any overspends and underspends relative to the initial 
ex-ante allowance set by the Regulator. Our assessment is that construction risk is best placed 
with the T&SCo developer and that the risks are within the bounds of a typical project. The 
construction period returns (i.e. BWACC) would be calibrated to reflect the specific risks for 
which T&SCo is responsible.  
 
33 
b) Incentive to manage construction cost of the storage facilities 
We are considering the risks associated with construction of new storage facilities and how the 
Regulator should mitigate the risk of inefficient costs during the construction period. Where the 
efficient costs are difficult to estimate by the Regulator, we currently consider that an ex-post 
efficiency assessment by the Regulator may be an appropriate way to calculate those costs. 
The Regulator would only allow efficient and economic cost to be logged onto RAV. 
c) Incentive to complete construction of the T&S network as planned 
Any delay in commissioning the T&S network means a delay in the revenues T&SCo receives 
from users. This forms a natural incentive for T&SCo to deliver on time. A delay in completion 
of the T&S network could lead to a knock-on impact to the users where CO₂ captured cannot 
be transferred away from users. As a result, the government is considering a penalty which 
would reduce the starting RAV under a T&S network construction delay scenario. 
Users would continue to receive support through their funding model such as a DPA and ICC 
Contract, in the event where T&S network COD is delayed. 
d) Incentive to reduce through-life cost when acquiring existing asset for CCUS 
application  
In a scenario where an existing asset is proposed to be transferred into the CCUS regulated 
regime, T&SCo would be incentivised to propose an asset that could provide the most value to 
the users by considering the cost saving potential over the lifecycle of the T&S network. We 
are considering the methodology for determining the transferred assets RAV and will provide 
an update in 2021. 
Operations phase: 
e) Incentive to maintain availability of the T&S network within set target 
The T&S network should be available for users to inject CO₂. There may be planned (e.g. for 
maintenance) and unplanned outages (e.g. caused by damage or capacity constraints). 
T&SCo may be subject to an availability incentive that rewards higher levels of availability than 
what is considered as industry best practice but penalise worse performance relative to a 
pre-set target. The government is considering the following:  
• in-year penalty: when availability falls below the set target, penalties would initially 
reduce allowed revenue for that charging year; 
• multi-years penalty: if availability falls below an in-year penalty threshold (e.g. to a 
level undermining short term cash flow and financeability), T&SCo would continue to 
incur penalties, however these could be spread over subsequent charging years; and  
• penalty floor: if availability falls further below a floor (such that T&SCo’s financeability is 
undermined over the price control period), lower availability would not result in additional 
penalties. Further actions may be taken by the Regulator, with options ranging from a 
 
34 
users’ loan (to be repaid in future price control period) to eventually revoking T&SCo’s 
economic licence if enforcement processes do not resolve the problem.  
If the T&S network is unavailable, users would continue to receive funding support. For 
example, power CCUS users would continue to receive an availability payment but not variable 
payment, while industrial CCUS users would be paid for based on a deemed CO₂ captured 
rate as defined by ICC Contract. 
f) Incentive to maintain leakage rate within set target: 
T&SCo would be responsible for all the cost associated with leaks from the T&S network.  
Similarly, T&SCo would be responsible for the costs associated with leakage from storage 
facilities during operations and following decommissioning until the site is returned to the 
government. We expect that T&SCo would seek to transfer away a degree of leakage risks 
from storage facilities through commercial insurance products. Where private insurance is not 
available, or is prohibitively priced, the government is considering its role through the GSP (see 
GSP section for details).  
In addition, we are considering the feasibility of a reserve from which T&SCo could draw to 
fund part of the costs associated with the leaks associated with the store if the cost is above a 
certain threshold. 
In the event of significant leakage from the storage facilities, the allowed revenue may include 
a cost allowance to support T&SCo to conduct leakage repairs or regulatory intervention.  
g) Incentive to manage expenditure of T&S network expansion (during the operational 
phase) 
T&SCo would be responsible for any expansion of the T&S network where required to connect 
new users or meet an increase in overall demand. Efficient asset expansion would be funded 
by the users as part of regulatory allowances. We expect that T&SCo will be incentivised to 
deliver this efficiently.  
h) Incentive to ensure anchor projects connect to the T&S network as scheduled  
The T&S network will have anchor capture projects. Anchor projects will be expected to 
connect and use the T&S network according to an agreed schedule. Where these users, or 
their demand, do not materialise then T&SCo would incur a small degree of reduction in its 
allowed revenue until all anchor projects (or users of equivalent size) have connected to the 
T&S network. This encourages robust forecasting and submission of a robust future demand 
scenario as part of the cluster selection process to ensure spend and timing of the T&S 
network’s construction is efficient. Calibration of the incentive would require further 
consideration including government support on capture projects recognising limitation on 
T&SCo’s control. 
i) Incentive to provide connection to users within an agreed timeframe 
 
35 
We are considering an incentive mechanism to further encourage T&SCo to ensure new users 
are connected in a timely fashion. 
j) Incentive to seek new users to utilise the T&S network 
We are considering an incentive mechanism to further encourage T&SCo to take a proactive 
approach with new connections. Calibration of the incentive would require further consideration 
including government support on capture projects recognising limitation on T&SCo’s control. 
k) Incentive to maintain the capacity at the level agreed with users 
T&SCo will provide an agreed capacity to users. In the event of T&S network constraints that 
prevent users injecting the agreed level of CO₂, T&SCo will receive less revenue from users to 
account for the lower volumes. In addition, to incentivise T&SCo to manage constraints 
effectively, the Regulator may impose performance penalties on T&SCo. It is intended that 
Users that are constrained would be protected through their funding model, see “T&S capacity 
constraint risk” in Section 4 and 5 for more details on the impact to users. 
l) Incentive/obligation to ensure the T&S network is compliant with wider regulatory, 
safety and legal requirements 
We will consider the interfaces between economic regulation and wider regulation including 
cost allowances for T&SCo to meet the wider regulatory, safety and legal requirements. We 
are considering options such as licence obligations and financial incentives/penalties.  
m) Incentive to manage operation expenditure  
The Regulator will provide an allowance for efficient opex during the operational period. The 
Regulator may consider risk sharing arrangements such as the use of reopeners (which allow 
for adjusting revenues from users to T&SCo) under a narrow set of circumstances. 
In addition we would expect the ERR to include detail on what an appropriate financing 
structure would be for T&SCo – evolving over time as the nature of the asset and market 
evolves.  
Government Support Package (GSP) 
If required, a GSP would offer protection to investors for specified remote high impact low 
probability risks that the private sector would not be able to bear at an efficient price or indeed 
any price. The GSP would also protect users of the T&S network from exposure to these risks. 
These risks are defined leakage events of CO₂ from storage facilities and asset stranding. Our 
intention is for the GSP (if required) to be for very remote risks, for a finite period of time, 
limited in its response, and only for specific events. 
Stranded asset risk 
 
36 
This is the risk that there is a complete and permanent loss of demand for the T&S network 
such that the T&S network assets become redundant or deemed uneconomic. T&SCo would 
lose its user revenues meaning that the T&S asset is no longer economically viable. The 
impact on T&SCo could be the loss of remaining investment; an end to business-as-usual 
operating expenditure, which may be offset by increased operating expenditure to preserve the 
asset for future use, or to prepare it for accelerated decommissioning and an accelerated 
decommissioning process resulting in a shortfall in decommissioning funding. 
The government considers this a low probability risk but recognises that the market may 
currently be unable to bear this risk and that some form of government support to manage it 
may initially be required. The government will ensure taxpayer exposure is sufficiently remote, 
for example by using the below conditions before the GSP could be triggered:  
• where commercial insurance is unavailable or inadequate: commercial insurances 
should be acquired by T&SCo, where available and GSP would only step in as insurer 
of last resort for uninsurable risk or where there is insufficient capacity in the market or 
high deductibles; 
• where the risk has been proactively minimised through new connections: T&SCo 
would be incentivised to seek users through the connection incentive; 
• where regulatory involvement is inadequate: there could be potential regulatory 
interventions at the appropriate time to support either asset repurposing or development 
of an import market (to effectively acquire a new type of user); 
• where further revenue options are exhausted: the options of consumers and 
taxpayer providing revenue support in an underutilisation and timing mismatch scenario 
is being explored; 
• where cost profiles have been adapted to reduce the likelihood of asset stranding: 
adjustments to the depreciation (and decommissioning) profile may be applied to match 
the risk profile of stranded assets over the operational period; and 
• where GSP exposure is offset by asset sale and reduced spend: sales of T&S 
assets to recover any remaining values from the investors, as well as potentially halting 
construction if it becomes clear that users are not demonstrating progress to build 
capture equipment. 
The GSP would only cover the complete stranding of assets in circumstances where it is 
considered outside T&SCo’s reasonable control. Temporary or reduced demand risk (i.e. 
underutilisation) would instead be mitigated through the revenue model. 
We are considering how the GSP might act as an ‘insurer of last resort’ and compensate 
T&SCo up to the remaining RAV, and/or any remaining critical opex associated with 
mothballing or early decommissioning.  
Risk of defined CO₂ leakage from storage facilities 
 
37 
T&SCo’s responsibility for leakage costs would remain until the liability is transferred to the 
government. T&SCo should use the private insurance market where possible to mitigate this 
exposure.  
Where private insurance is not available, the GSP would potentially provide insurance of last 
resort. However, before the GSP would be triggered, the government is considering the 
following but not exhaustive mitigations to ensure taxpayer exposure is sufficiently remote:  
• careful selection of storage sites: T&SCo is required to carry out appropriate due 
diligence and substantiation on the containment integrity of the proposed storage 
facilities. The government would also carry out independent due diligence on proposed 
storage facilities, taking advice from the relevant regulatory authorities as necessary; 
• effective incentive regime: T&SCo would be incentivised to minimise CO₂ leakage and 
bear the risk of CO₂ leakage to a financeability threshold through ERR (see ERR 
section for details); and 
• use of commercial insurance: T&SCo will be required to procure commercial 
insurances where available at an efficient cost to cover transport and storage leakage 
risks where possible, as the government expects a commercial insurance market to 
develop. 
Consideration of risks 
Management and allocation of risks is critical to the investability of the CCUS sector. This 
section sets out how risk which could potentially affect the T&S network are dealt with in the 
TRI Model. This includes cross-chain risks which arise where an event originating in the T&S 
network affects power or industrial users and vice versa. We would continue to develop and 
refine the risk allocation in the future as we engage with stakeholders. 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation  
T&S specific risks 
T&S 
construction 
delay  
Risk that the T&S 
network is not 
completed to 
schedule as agreed 
with the Regulator. 
Delay to completion 
could lead to users 
having no facility to 
transport and store 
CO₂ (i.e. T&S timing 
mismatch risk). 
There would be a delay in T&SCo beginning to receive 
revenue. The Regulator may also impose penalties on 
T&SCo through an adjustment to the opening RAV. 
Users would be protected from T&S timing mismatch 
risk through the corresponding business model. See 
T&S timing mismatch risk in Section 4 and 5 for more 
details on user protection. 
 
38 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation  
Constructio
n cost 
overruns 
Risk that outturn 
construction costs 
are higher than 
base case or 
inefficient 
construction cost 
incurred. 
T&SCo would bear the construction cost overruns 
risks. Overrun above base case in an ex-ante 
assessment for transport facilities, or inefficient cost 
incurred in an ex-post assessment for storage facilities 
would not be logged onto the opening RAV.  
T&S 
construction 
incompletio
n  
Risk that the 
construction of the 
T&S network is not 
completed. 
Incompletion of T&S 
network could lead 
to users’ capture 
plants becoming 
stranded. 
T&SCo would not be receiving any revenue or 
compensated for capital investment if T&S network is 
not completed, with the exception of Force Majeure 
events. 
Users would be protected from stranded asset risk 
through the corresponding business model. See user 
stranded asset risk in Section 4 and 5 for more details 
on user protection. 
T&S 
unplanned 
outage  
T&S network is 
unavailable to 
transport and store 
CO₂ from users. 
T&S unplanned 
outage could result 
in a knock-on 
impact on users 
including unable to 
inject CO₂ into the 
T&S network and 
users were forced to 
emit CO₂ or 
shutdown the entire 
plant. 
T&SCo would bear the majority of unplanned outage 
risk. An availability incentive would reduce allowed 
revenues in-year and across multiple years to 
incentivise T&SCo to maintain the availability within 
the set target. The reduction in allowed revenue would 
be limited to ensure financeability of the T&SCo 
through provision of a penalty floor. 
Users would be protected from unplanned outage 
through their corresponding business model. See T&S 
unplanned outage risk in Section 4 and 5 for more 
details on user protection. 
 
39 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation  
T&S 
capacity 
constraint  
Lower than 
expected level of 
capacity 
(injection/offtake 
rate or storage 
volume) available in 
the transport and/or 
storage facility. This 
could result in a 
knock-on impact on 
users including 
injecting less CO₂ 
into the T&S 
network and users 
could be forced to 
emit CO₂. 
T&SCo would bear the majority of capacity constraint 
risk if within T&SCo’s reasonable control. A capacity 
incentive would reduce allowed revenues for T&SCo if 
the outturn capacity is less the set target.  
Users would be protected from T&S capacity 
constraint risk through their corresponding business 
model. If users were causing the constraint (over 
injection compared to the injection rate agreed with 
T&SCo), users would be subject to a penalty. 
See T&S capacity constraint in Section 4 and 5 for 
more details on user protection. 
User timing 
mismatch 
Timing mismatch 
risk will arise if the 
first users are 
connected to the 
T&S network later 
than planned.  
T&SCo would bear a small degree of user timing 
mismatch risk. T&SCo’s return would be reduced and 
deferred until a user connects to the T&S network. 
T&SCo would be protected from cashflow shortfall 
impacts for opex through compensation from the 
delayed user or recourse from consumers and/or 
taxpayers. 
 
40 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation  
Underutilisat
ion risk  
Risk that T&S 
network utilisation is 
lower than 
expected, leading to 
a shortfall in 
revenue from users 
to T&SCo.  
T&SCo allowed revenue would be subject to a small 
degree of reduction if utilisation is reduced. However, 
underutilisation risk would be shared with users and 
government through potential government capital 
contributions to T&SCo, provision of a financial 
reserve, mutualisation mechanism (only triggers when 
there is a large user base) and contingent recourse to 
consumers and/or taxpayers. 
There are various causes that could lead to 
underutilisation risk including user unplanned outage, 
user construction delay or user construction 
incompletion. Users would bear the majority of these 
risks. See underutilisation risk (users unplanned 
outage, construction incompletion and delay risks) in 
Section 4 and 5 for more details on risk to users.  
T&S 
stranded 
asset risk  
Complete and 
permanent loss of 
demand for the T&S 
network as a result 
of events outside 
the control of 
T&SCo (e.g. change 
of regulation or 
government policy) 
such that the T&S 
network assets 
become 
economically 
redundant.  
T&SCo would be protected from stranded asset risk in 
certain circumstances. GSP would act as ‘insurer of 
last resort’ and compensate T&SCo up to the 
remaining RAV, and/or any remaining critical opex 
associated with mothballing or early decommissioning. 
 
 
41 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation  
CO₂ 
leakage 
from T&S 
network  
Risk of CO₂ leakage 
from the transport or 
storage facilities. 
This could result in 
a knock-on impact 
on users similar to 
T&S unplanned 
outage risk. 
T&SCo would bear the leakage risks from transport 
facilities. For leakage from storage facilities, T&SCo 
would bear the leakage risks up to a very remote 
threshold. T&SCo would be expected to seek 
commercial insurance products in the market. GSP 
would provide insurer of last resort protection to 
T&SCo above the remote threshold. 
Users would be protected from CO₂ leakage from T&S 
network risk through their corresponding business 
model. See T&S unplanned outage risk (due to the 
equivalent impact) in Section 4 and 5 for more details 
on user protection.  
General risks 
Regulatory 
and political 
risk 
General change in 
government policy 
or change of Law 
during construction 
and operation that 
has a material 
impact on the T&S 
network. 
These risks are outside the control of T&SCo and if 
materialise, the Regulator may consider adjustment to 
agreed base case. Further consideration would be 
required to establish the definition and scope of 
regulatory and political risk. 
In the event that stranded asset risk arises from 
change in regulation or change in government policy, 
then T&SCo may be supported by the GSP. 
Developme
nt 
 
Investor risk of 
investing in the 
development of the 
project without the 
certainty of 
regulatory approval. 
Investment would only be recoverable if the 
prospective licensee receives an economic licence 
and spend is deemed efficient by the Regulator. 
Development cost risk may be shared to the extent of 
any government support such as Industrial 
Decarbonisation Challenge fund. 
Force 
Majeure 
Extraordinary and 
unforeseeable risks 
that are beyond 
reasonable control 
by T&SCo. 
Regulatory adjustments to the revenue, provided 
appropriate mitigations were in place. 
 
42 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation  
Inflation 
Risk that costs 
inflate more than 
anticipated by the 
price control, 
impacting expected 
returns. 
T&SCo allowed revenue building blocks would be 
linked to mitigate the risk of inflation. 
Bad debt  
Risk that users 
default on T&S fees 
payments to 
T&SCo. 
T&SCo would be protected from bad debt risk above a 
threshold. T&SCo would have access the following 
measures:  
• users’ collateral; 
• the bad debt allowances; 
• mutualisation over the remaining user base 
once sufficient users established; and  
• potential contingent recourse to consumers 
and/or taxpayers. 
Decommissi
oning 
shortfall risk 
There is a risk 
where the 
decommissioning 
reserve is not 
accrued sufficiently 
to cover the 
decommissioning 
cost. 
T&SCo would bear the decommissioning shortfall risk. 
We are considering how this can be implemented as 
part of the wider CCUS decommissioning regime.  
In a remote scenario where shortfall remains after 
exhausting all T&SCo measures and mitigations. We 
would consider the role of government as a 
‘decommissioner of last resort’.

Section 4: Dispatchable Power Agreement 
for Power CCUS 
Introduction 
Decarbonising the power sector has led the UK’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
In 1990, electricity generation accounted for 25% of UK emissions. In 2018, it was only 15%. 
Thirty years ago, fossil fuels provided nearly 80% of electricity supply. Today, the country gets 
over half of its power from low carbon technologies. The rapid growth of renewables has been 
a critical feature of this transformation. 
The Energy White Paper sets out the government’s view of how to achieve a low cost, low 
carbon electricity system. A low cost system is likely to be composed predominantly of 
renewable electricity. Achieving a low cost system, which is also reliable, means renewables 
need to be complemented by technologies which provide power when the wind is not blowing 
or the sun does not shine. Power CCUS is one of the technologies that can provide this 
capacity.  
Our objective is to develop a business model which enables power CCUS to play a valuable 
mid-merit role in our generation mix. We recognise that a plant acting in dispatchable mode will 
have multiple features which we need to consider in deploying a business model. As power 
CCUS plants incur fuel costs and, using current capture technologies, emit some residual CO₂, 
we believe they should be reactive to the electricity market and should not displace low- or 
zero-marginal cost, low carbon technologies such as renewables or nuclear power. However, if 
we are to allow power CCUS technology to follow market movements, we understand that at 
current carbon prices, power CCUS plants are unlikely to displace higher carbon alternative 
equivalent capacity. A key balance in developing the business model is to provide initial plants 
with sufficient support to give investor confidence, while ensuring that these projects are 
affordable and represent VfM for consumers.  
The business model set out in this section is intended to cover technologies which have CCUS 
technology applied directly to a thermal power plant, including pre-combustion,  
post-combustion, and oxy-fuel technologies. This encompasses both new build CCUS power 
plants and retrofitted CCUS power plants. In addition, hydrogen-fired power plants which are 
standalone from hydrogen production infrastructure could be considered under the power 
CCUS business model discussed, however, this would be dependent on the development of 
an appropriate hydrogen business model. 
We are currently considering a DPA which could be established between the power CCUS 
project company and the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a government company, 
with subsidies which may be funded by consumers through the existing framework of the 
Supplier Obligation. The structure of this mechanism is intended to address key risks and 
challenges associated with deploying CCUS.

4. LCCC acts as counterparty to the DPA 
5. DPA provides the Generator with payments comprising of an availability and variable 
payment 
6. Consumer subsidy funds availability and variable payment 
7. Return on investment back to private sector 
Work undertaken by BEIS, in consultation with expert working groups from industry and 
supporting advisers, has identified a high-level concept for the proposed DPA payment 
mechanism structure, consisting of an availability payment and variable payment. This was set 
out in the government’s response to the consultation CCUS Business Models in August 
2020.12  
Objectives of the DPA for power CCUS 
The following objectives are being used to guide DPA design and address the key challenges 
faced in establishing power CCUS:  
• provide sufficient investor confidence: it is important to balance the inherent 
uncertainty of a dispatchable role with the need for power CCUS to be an investable 
proposition. The design of the DPA availability payment mechanism forms a basis for a 
 
12 https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-ccus-business-models  
 
45 
level of revenue certainty, but investors will need to consider the revenues which they 
can make from the wholesale electricity market and other markets such as those for 
balancing and ancillary services when building a business case. The DPA is designed to 
ensure the investment proposition remains without removing the incentives of the CCUS 
project to participate efficiently in existing markets; 
• incentivising the plant to react to the wholesale electricity market: by providing 
availability payments which are decoupled from dispatch, the plant should be 
incentivised to react to market prices and provide dispatchable output without 
incentivising the power CCUS project to generate at all times, which would displace 
lower-carbon sources of generation such as renewables and nuclear. The flexibility of 
power CCUS projects should allow it to complement the intermittency of renewables by 
adjusting output to meet changes in electricity demand, whilst still capturing emissions 
from generation; 
• displacing comparable unabated generation and reacting to carbon prices: the 
variable payment should be designed to be sufficient to ensure that the power CCUS 
project dispatches ahead of the unabated equivalent reference plant by accounting for 
the difference in costs arising from installing carbon capture equipment. Incentivising a 
power CCUS plant to displace higher carbon alternatives will maximise the contribution 
of these plants to electricity system decarbonisation. The level of the payment should be 
reactive to carbon prices and power plant costs, meaning that it is only paid when 
necessary; and  
• ensuring affordability and value for money for consumers: the link to energy bills 
means any spend should be efficient and look to deliver VfM for consumers through 
minimising unit costs, maximising competition and reducing barriers to entry. 
We are considering the appropriate process for awarding DPAs to bring forward initial plants. 
This could be a negotiated or competitive process and will be dependent, to an extent, on the 
future deployment of CCUS clusters.  
Regardless of the process followed for initial deployment, moving forward we will consider the 
introduction of a competitive award process which, if designed appropriately, could contribute 
to reducing the cost of deployment.  
We will ensure that power CCUS fully participates in existing market frameworks where 
possible, while achieving our objectives for the technology. In future, this participation could 
include using wider market frameworks to drive deployment of power CCUS plants as required 
by the electricity system. We will set out a clearly defined methodology to assess the suitability 
of a potential market-driven approach against our objectives at regular periods. 
Legal and Contractual Framework  
The DPA is based on the contractual framework established for the standard Contract for 
Difference (CfD), but with specific amendments to ensure that the mechanism meets the 
challenges identified. We propose to replicate key provisions from the standard CfD, which 
 
46 
could provide certain protections where these may be important for FOAK projects. An 
overview of the legal and contractual framework, highlighting key differences with the standard 
CfD, is given at Annex C. Alongside this document we have also published the draft Heads of 
Terms (HoT) for the DPA, at Annex D.  
Roles and responsibilities of the power CCUS plant company 
The Generator shall be responsible for the full lifecycle ownership of the power CCUS plant, 
including development, financing, construction (including retrofit, if applicable), operations, 
maintenance, and decommissioning. It is intended that the power CCUS plant shall include the 
power generation facility and carbon capture plant, including the associated auxiliary plant to 
enable dispatchable low carbon power generation.  
Some of the specific areas which the Generator will be responsible for include: 
• construction and commissioning of the power CCUS plant, upon which payments under 
the DPA will commence;  
• installation, configuration, registration, and maintenance of the electrical metering, CO₂ 
metering and gas supply metering in accordance with the relevant codes and standards; 
• installation, configuration, registration, and maintenance of the CO₂ compositional 
analysis equipment; and 
• supplying CO₂ at the entry point to the T&S network within the agreed limits of 
composition, temperature, and pressure and ensuring that any out of specification CO₂ 
is diverted to the atmosphere prior to entry to the T&S network. 
For responsibilities of the T&SCo, refer to Section 3.  
In order to ensure that out-of-specification CO₂ is not allowed into the T&S network, the power 
CCUS plant shall include continuous monitoring of the export CO₂ composition and emergency 
venting system design. The required CO₂ metering and compositional monitoring would be the 
responsibility of the Generator, with data interface also provided to T&SCo and DPA 
counterparty, for payment settlement purposes. 
Payment Mechanism  
The proposed DPA consists of two payments: an availability payment for low carbon 
generation capacity and a variable payment. The availability payment is intended to provide 
investors with a regular payment based on the availability of low carbon generation capacity.  
The proposed formula is based on a constant availability payment rate (APR), but the 
availability payment should be reduced in the case of outages of generation or capture 
equipment, or poor performance against the expected capture rate. The proposed formula can 
be found in Annex C.  
 
47 
The variable payment is intended to incentivise the contracted plant to generate ahead of an 
unabated equivalent plant when demand cannot be met by low marginal cost technologies 
such as renewables and nuclear, at times where the market would not provide sufficient 
incentive for dispatch ahead of such an unabated plant. The variable payment will be 
calculated by considering the difference in short run marginal cost between the power CCUS 
plant as agreed in the DPA contract and a theoretical reference unabated plant.  
The proposed formula, which can be found in Annex C, achieves this aim by taking into 
account the higher gas costs, lower carbon costs, T&S volumetric fees, and other higher costs 
faced by the power CCUS plant, ensuring that its overall short run marginal costs are less than 
the short run marginal costs faced by an equivalent unabated plant in normal operations.  
Further detail on the T&S fees can be found in Section 3. 
Figure 6: the diagram below provides a holistic view of the costs and revenues associated with 
a power CCUS plant and their structure of payment 
   
 
Gain sharing 
A gain sharing mechanism could, in a set number of circumstances, allow for greater fairness 
of financial returns and risk sharing between power CCUS plant investors and consumers, 
provided that this is done in a way which aligns with fiscal rules.

The mechanics of such a mechanism are still to be explored but could be aimed at the 
following types of scenarios:  
• where build costs are lower than projections, particularly for initial projects; 
• where operational costs are lower than projections, due to the high level of technical 
and operational cost uncertainty with initial projects;  
• where operational revenues from the wholesale electricity market and other energy 
markets (including ancillary services) are higher than projections and enable the power 
CCUS plant to recover a significant proportion of its fixed costs without the availability 
payment; and 
• to prevent a generator accessing excess returns that may not align with an appropriate 
level of development risk. 
Financing arrangements 
It is important that the design of the DPA can unlock private sector investment, which will drive 
large scale deployment of power CCUS plants. We believe that the proposed DPA mechanism, 
comprising both availability and variable elements described earlier in this section, will be 
attractive to the private sector. This is because the use of the consumer subsidy provides a 
level of revenue certainty, mitigating the development risks associated with CCUS projects. 
Moreover, the DPA will be based on the framework of the standard CfD, which has a tried and 
tested commercial model.  
In designing the DPA, we want to ensure that the roll out of power CCUS will have access to a 
broad pool of investment in order to maximise competition and innovation. Our expectation is 
that the DPA will attract investment from a range of different investment sources, such as 
power operators, energy companies, infrastructure funds, and debt providers. This reflects our 
experience of the standard CfD in attracting investment. The DPA has been designed to 
provide long-term revenue stability, as well as to provide a degree of certainty over dispatch in 
the wholesale market, both of which mitigate significant risks for potential power CCUS plant 
developers. 
Trade-offs naturally exist between the various sources of finance due to their individual 
requirements and it is likely that the potential pricing available will vary depending on a 
project’s risk profile and investors’ appetite to take on risk. For this reason, the next stage of 
work on the financing approach is to engage with the market to understand the identified 
sources further and to consider the possible availability of each.  
Consideration of risks 
Since publishing the government response, we have been developing a risk allocation for 
power CCUS at each phase of the project. Risks are allocated to the party considered best 
placed to manage the risk. Where this threatens the other objectives, particularly in relation to 
 
49 
power CCUS being financeable, deliverable, and VfM for consumers, some sharing of risk may 
be desirable.  
In this section, we have considered the key risks for the implementation of power CCUS and 
possible mitigations within the business model design. Further discussion on the allocation of 
cross-chain risks is found later in this section. 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation 
Availability and use  
User construction 
delay 
Risk that the 
construction is not 
completed to schedule. 
Delay to completion 
could lead to T&S 
having no utilisation if 
the delayed user is the 
anticipated first user (i.e. 
user timing mismatch 
risk). 
Payments would not be made until 
certain milestone requirements as set 
out in the DPA are met. The Generator 
would agree a Target Commissioning 
Window (TCW) but can commission 
later during a long-stop window, though 
this would result in erosion to the term 
of the DPA (subject to any Force 
Majeure extensions of time).  
The T&S capacity fees would remain 
payable to T&SCo during any period of 
delay beyond the TCW where the T&S 
network has been commissioned. We 
are considering whether this cost could 
be met by consumers. 
If the delayed user is the first user, we 
are considering the feasibility of 
payment from the delayed user to cover 
T&S critical opex. See Section 3 for 
more details on T&SCo protection on 
user timing mismatch risk.  
Development risk 
 
Development 
expenditure is 
committed at risk before 
entry into the DPA.  
The Generator would not be 
compensated for any development 
expenditure if the project is not 
awarded a DPA. 
 
50 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation 
T&S timing 
mismatch 
T&S timing mismatch 
risk will arise if the T&S 
network is not 
completed to schedule 
as agreed with the 
Regulator (i.e. T&S 
construction delay risk), 
with the Generator 
unable to inject CO₂ 
while waiting for the T&S 
network to be 
completed. 
The Generator would be protected from 
commissioning timing mismatch risk by 
the DPA. Availability payments would 
be paid to the Generator if 
commissioned, available and 
performance requirements are met 
during the mismatch period. The 
variable payment would not be paid in 
this event and the Generator would be 
allowed to operate in the market as an 
unabated plant, and would be subject to 
normal carbon pricing arrangements. 
Alternatively, as the Generator’s TCW 
may be extended (e.g. due to a T&S 
delay), the Generator may have the 
choice to instead delay its 
commissioning to match the T&S 
schedule (in which case the Generator 
will not see the DPA term commencing 
(and therefore will not receive any 
payments) until it commissions). 
T&SCo would bear the majority of T&S 
construction overrun risk. See T&S 
construction delay risk in Section 3 for 
more details. 
Demand risk 
Changes in generation 
mix and/ or system 
demand over time result 
in reduced operating 
hours.  
The Generator would be protected 
against a degree of demand risk 
through the availability payment, 
structured such that the Generator 
would receive relatively stable revenue 
over the term of the DPA, subject to 
plant availability and performance. The 
Generator would take demand risk 
above this level.  
 
 
51 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation 
Power CCUS plant 
availability risk 
Planned or unplanned 
outage of power CCUS 
plant (generation and/ or 
capture). 
The Generator takes availability risk. 
Availability payment would be 
calculated relative to availability and 
performance of the Generator (subject 
to any specific outage event relief). 
T&S unplanned 
outage 
Temporary unplanned or 
planned outage of T&S 
network. 
 
The Generator would be protected from 
outages outside of their control through 
the DPA. Availability payments would 
not be reduced for qualifying third party 
outages. These could include those on 
the T&S network, the electricity 
transmission system, or the gas 
transmission system (except in 
instances where the outages are 
caused by the Generator). Variable 
payments will not be received. 
T&SCo would bear the majority of 
unplanned outage risk. See T&S 
unplanned outage risk in Section 3 for 
more details on the impact on T&SCo. 
 
52 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation 
T&S capacity 
constraint 
Lower than expected 
level of capacity 
(injection/ offtake rate or 
storage volume) 
available in the transport 
and/or storage facility 
either due to T&S 
network issues, or the 
Generator injecting CO₂ 
into the T&S network at 
a rate greater than 
agreed, leading to the 
user and/or other users 
being constrained. 
 
The Generator would be protected from 
T&S capacity constraint by the DPA, 
where this is not caused by the 
Generator. The Generator will continue 
to receive the availability payment, 
subject to the power CCUS plant’s 
availability and performance.  
The Generator would be subject to 
penalty (governed in the agreement 
between the Generator and the T&SCo) 
if T&S network capacity constraints are 
caused by over-injection by the 
Generator.  
T&SCo allowed revenue would be 
reduced if capacity level is lower than 
set target. See T&S capacity constraint 
risk in Section 3 for more details on the 
impact on T&SCo.  
User stranded 
asset 
 
If the T&S network fails 
to be constructed or is 
abandoned post-
commissioning, then 
power CCUS plant 
would become stranded. 
The Generator would be protected from 
stranded asset risk through the DPA. If 
the power CCUS plant is available, the 
Generator would continue to receive 
availability payments, but not variable 
payments. If the DPA is terminated, the 
Generator would be compensated for 
their investment at a pre-agreed pay-
out rate as part of the DPA 
(compensation formula TBC). 
See T&S construction incompletion risk 
in Section 3 for more details on the 
impact to T&SCo. 
Performance 
 
53 
Risk 
Description 
Allocation 
Operating 
performance risk 
There is uncertainty over 
the performance of a 
power CCUS plant and 
the impact on variable 
costs. There is also 
uncertainty in how this 
performance may 
change over time.  
The DPA would account for the higher 
gas costs and lower carbon costs of a 
power CCUS plant vs an unabated 
equivalent plant through the variable 
payment. However, the DPA will not 
account for any differences between 
the power CCUS plant operational 
performance and the performance 
parameters agreed in the DPA (see 
Reference plant capturability risk).  
We are considering whether the 
hypothetical reference plant could be 
updated to reflect ongoing technological 
improvements in unabated equivalent 
plants.  
CO₂ quality 
Poor performance of the 
power CCUS capture 
plant could result in CO₂ 
quality that is lower than 
the standard required by 
the T&S network.  
The Generator would be required to 
operate continuous quality monitoring 
and emergency venting system to 
ensure that no out-of-specification CO₂ 
enters the T&S network.  
Any vented CO₂ would not be 
accounted for as captured CO₂ under 
the DPA payment mechanism and 
would be subject to carbon pricing.

Risk 
Description 
Allocation 
Commodity price 
risk 
Risk that the prices for 
carbon and natural gas 
do not follow expected 
trajectories and leave 
the power CCUS plant 
out of merit relative to 
the unabated equivalent 
plant. 
The Generator would be protected by 
the DPA from impacts of commodity 
price risk on the short run marginal cost 
of the power CCUS plant when 
compared to the unabated equivalent 
plant. The natural gas price and carbon 
price will be referenced to market price 
indicators in the variable payment 
formula. The Generator would take 
commodity price capturability risk/ 
reward (see Reference price 
capturability risk). 
 
Reference price 
capturability risk 
Risk that the Generator 
does not capture 
commodity prices 
equivalent to reference 
price indicators.  
The Generator would take reference 
price capturability risk/ reward. The 
DPA will not take account of any 
hedging arrangements, therefore there 
will be an incentive for the Generator to 
trade commodities effectively to capture 
the best possible prices.  
 
Reference plant 
capturability risk 
Risk that the power 
CCUS plant (and 
therefore the formulae 
which calculate the cost 
differential with the 
unabated equivalent 
reference plant) differs 
significantly from the 
asset defined in the 
DPA. 
The Generator would take reference 
plant capturability risk. The DPA would 
incorporate the assumed parameters of 
the power CCUS plant under reference 
conditions, reflecting the final design of 
the plant.  
T&S fees increase  
T&S fees charged to 
users are increased. 
The Generator would be protected from 
an increase in T&S fees by indexation 
of these fees in the DPA. The variable 
payment formula accounts for the T&S 
volumetric fees (unless covered by 
market revenues) and the availability 
payment for the T&S capacity fees.

General 
Regulatory and 
political risk 
Change in government

specific/ discriminatory changes in law, 
with the precise scope to be 
determined) by the DPA. 
Construction cost 
overruns 
Risk that outturn 
construction costs are 
higher than expected at 
time of entry into the 
DPA.  
The Generator takes construction risk/ 
reward. Availability payment rate set at 
point of entry into the DPA.  
Construction 
incompletion 
Risk that construction of 
the power CCUS plant is 
not completed.  
The Generator takes construction 
completion risk. The DPA payments will 
not commence if the power CCUS plant 
construction is not completed.  
Force Majeure risk 
Extraordinary and 
unforeseeable risks that 
are beyond the control 
of the Generator 
(subject to certain 
exceptions). 
The Generator would be entitled to an 
extension to key dates and relief from 
termination for Force Majeure events 
under the DPA.  
Inflation risk 
Risk that costs inflate 
more or less than 
anticipated. 
The Generator would be protected from 
inflation risk under the DPA. We are 
considering full or partial indexation of 
the availability payment. Market 
indicators would be used for the input 
costs in the variable payment formula. 
Consumers would be protected from 
overpayment if inflation lower than 
expected.  
 
56 
Summary: A Power business model to meet our objectives 
The business model will provide investor confidence  
The DPA is designed to overcome the inherent uncertainty of operating in a dispatchable role, 
and to incentivise investment by providing a long-term revenue stream through the availability 
payment. The availability payment forms a basis for revenue certainty, which investors should 
consider in addition to revenues from participating fully in the wholesale market, and balancing 
and ancillary services markets, in building a business case for investment in a power CCUS 
plant.  
The DPA will incentivise the plant to react to and participate in the wholesale electricity 
market 
Payment on the basis of availability, rather than generation output, means that the Generator 
does not have an incentive to constantly dispatch to maximise revenue, displacing other lower 
carbon, low short run marginal cost sources of electricity generation. Instead, it should be 
incentivised to respond to price signals and operate flexibly to generate in those periods in 
which supply from lower carbon alternatives, including intermittent renewables and nuclear, is 
insufficient to meet system demand. 
The DPA will incentivise power CCUS plants to displace comparable unabated 
generation 
The variable payment formula ensures that the power CCUS plant is incentivised to dispatch 
ahead of unabated Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT). The formula takes account of the 
variable input costs of each generator and covers the difference in costs arising from the 
operation of the capture unit. This includes the differences in gas cost, carbon cost, operation 
and maintenance, and volumetric T&S fees. Where the reference plant mechanism works 
accurately, the power CCUS plant should operate as though it were the most efficient 
unabated CCGT on the system, thereby displacing unabated CCGTs from the merit order. 
Our approach to deploying power CCUS will ensure affordability and value for money 
for consumers  
The DPA, and our ongoing approach to deployment of power CCUS technology, will drive 
value for money. The availability payment provides a long-term revenue stream, providing a 
sufficient level of confidence to investors and helping to lower the cost of capital. The variable 
payment will ensure that the plant can displace higher carbon alternatives in the electricity 
system but will only be paid when it is necessary to achieve this. Furthermore, as indicated, 
while initial contracts may be negotiated, we will consider the introduction of a competitive 
framework for awarding DPA contracts which we believe could further contribute to reducing 
the costs of deployment.

Section 5: Industrial Carbon Capture 
Introduction 
Industrial Carbon Capture (ICC) could play a vital role in decarbonising the industrial sector. It 
has the potential to secure the long-term competitiveness of energy intensive industries, 
support clean growth around the UK, protect existing jobs, generate new jobs and economic 
opportunities, and incentivise investment in new industrial sites. Decarbonisation of UK 
industry represents a significant challenge, with few viable options for large scale emissions 
abatement. ICC is seen as one of the most likely routes to providing significant emission 
reductions in the sector.13 
ICC however imposes costs associated with capital investment and financing, ongoing 
operational costs for running the capture equipment and system costs including T&S fees to 
use the T&S network. These costs are combined with no corresponding increase in product 
value for being low carbon. This means that at present, the costs cannot be passed on to the 
industrial facility’s consumers, although there are benefits in terms of avoidance of carbon 
pricing and being well positioned to take account of a low carbon products market, as it 
develops. As a FOAK application in the UK, ICC will initially have higher capital costs and a 
risk premium may be attached to it which creates further risks and uncertainties to potential 
investors. 
In order to overcome these market failures and challenges, we are developing a commercial 
offer to industry through an ICC Contract to drive decarbonisation in the sector and support the 
competitiveness of our industrial base. This offer will be between the owner of the industrial 
facility (or a third party on behalf of the industrial facility) and a private counterparty, acting on 
behalf of the Secretary of State for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial 
Strategy. 
Our objective is to develop a business model that can incentivise: i) existing industrial facilities 
who have a viable future in the UK to invest in carbon capture to decarbonise, while 
maintaining their international competitiveness and delivering value for money for the taxpayer; 
and ii) investment in new industrial facilities in the UK, supporting our ambition to level up the 
UK’s economy. 
Building on our position in summer 2020, and in consultation with the Industrial Carbon 
Capture expert group, bilateral discussions with industry and with our supporting advisers, we 
are able to set out our ‘minded-to’ position on the commercial concept to incentivise FOAK ICC 
in the UK. This provides provisional detail on key commercial policy terms on which detailed 
contractual drafting will be based and which we will discuss in detail with potential projects and 
 
13 All scenarios of ambition in the Committee on Climate Change’s Net Zero Technical Report cite CCUS as the 
largest single contributor to the decarbonisation of industry. 
 
58 
investors. It confirms that capex co-funding will only be available to support construction costs 
for initial projects.  
The model outlined here is reflective of both the initial investment nature of ICC projects, and 
the current immaturity of the low carbon industrial market in the UK. Therefore, the model set 
out is for initial and early-stage ICC projects and we expect it to evolve as the technology, 
investment confidence and market for low carbon products develops, leading to later projects 
following a competitive allocation process and a market-driven reference price in line with that 
which has been established for the standard CfDs in the electricity market. 
We are looking to put in place a commercial framework that is similar to the standard CfD, 
which has been allocated competitively since 2014, but with some alterations and specific 
features that accommodate the sectoral and structural differences. Indicative Heads of Terms 
(HoTs) for the ICC Contract, produced by LCCC at the request of BEIS, shows the initial 
framework for the commercial contractual arrangements. This is included in Annex E and 
development will now start on detailed commercial drafting of the HoTs. 
The proposed business model has been designed to reward permanent storage of CO₂. As 
such, it will enable the export of captured CO₂ to the T&S network, paid for by T&S fees. This 
approach has been adopted on the basis that CO₂ produced from an ICC project should be 
exported to the T&S network. We consider utilisation of CO₂ to be outside the scope of this 
business model unless it leads to permanent abatement of CO2, although we do recognise 
that utilisation could still be important in supporting cost reduction and the economics of 
projects.  
Key commercial components of the proposed business model for industrial carbon 
capture for initial projects 
For early projects the reference price for the ICC Contract will be a fixed trajectory that 
will be defined in advance of contract negotiation and provide a stable analogue to the 
carbon market price so that industry can price for projected carbon costs. The agreement 
will see ETS free allowance certificates forfeited in line with capture volumes and 
monetised against the reference price14, while residual emissions (and any remaining 
free allowance certificates) will remain subject to the ETS. As carbon capture is 
established and the low carbon market matures, it is intended that the reference price 
would evolve to a market-driven carbon price. 
The strike price will be negotiated bilaterally for initial projects, moving to a competitive 
allocation process as the technology matures, when more CCUS clusters are operational 
and project bid pools are sufficiently large to allow competition. 
 
14 Further detail on treatment of free allowances and how the reference price trajectory will be agreed will be set 
out in 2021 
 
59 
The ICC Contract will have an overall duration of 15-years. We are minded for this to be 
based on a 10-year initial period covering operational expenses for running capture 
equipment, T&S fees, and a rate of return on capital investment. Following the end of this 
initial 10-year period, there could be an additional period of 5 years that will only outlay 
operational costs and T&S fees. This could be delivered through either (i) an option for 
government and the industrial facility of a 5-year extension to the initial 10-year contract 
term, or (ii) an initial contract duration of 15-years, with a reopener on the strike price 
after the initial 10-year period which could take account of the carbon price and 
development of the low carbon products market in the UK by that time. Further work will 
follow in 2021 on the capex repayment period within the 10-year period as well as the 
process for the contract extension or reopener at year 10 to cover years 11-15. 
Capital co-funding grants will only be available to support initial capital investment, with 
the remainder funded through private investment sources and/or by the industrial facility’s 
owner balance sheet. 
The industrial facility will take on risks associated with CO₂ leakage in its part of the 
network, decommissioning of capture plant, supply chain capability and commercial 
financing. The private law contract would protect the industrial facility from certain 
unforeseeable and material policy changes. 
With respect to construction and operating risk, it is anticipated that the private sector will 
be able to manage these risks most effectively, with some provisions to mitigate the risks 
inherent in FOAK projects. For construction risks, this includes providing an element of 
capital grant funding structured on a last spend basis and establishing a Target 
Commissioning Window to provide sufficient flexibility on the operational start date. For 
operating risks, it is anticipated that a potential operating expenditure reopener early on 
in the project may be beneficial to both parties in FOAK projects. Further work will be 
undertaken in these areas. Additionally, the treatment of demand risk is being further 
evaluated, with measures to limit overall cost to the taxpayer as well as potential 
limitations on downside risk for the industrial facility being considered. 
The ICC Contract will be a private law contract between a government-appointed 
counterparty to the ICC Contract and the owner of the industrial facility (or a third party 
on its behalf). This counterparty is anticipated to be the Low Carbon Contracts Company 
(LCCC), subject to agreement and any necessary legal and administrative changes. 
 
The model laid out in this section is under development and represents the government’s 
current ‘minded-to’ position on the commercial offer for, and handling of, the ICC Contract. This 
work is ongoing and further updates will describe additions and clarifications to the 
model during the formulation and drafting of commercial HoTs during 2021. This will build on 
the high-level and indicative HoTs that have been drafted by LCCC on behalf of BEIS. 
 
60 
The engagement with industry stakeholders is, and has been, welcome and essential to this 
process, and will continue throughout the development of the HoTs via our Industrial Carbon 
Capture expert group and bilateral discussions with individual clusters and projects.  
Further updates will focus on detailed commercial drafting of the HoTs in the annex, in addition 
to answering extant policy and delivery questions, including:  
• profiling of the reference price, including additional detail on treatment of free 
allowances and approach to indexation; 
• further developed thinking on the strike price approach, including possible options for 
adjustments, T&S fee handling and sectoral banding; 
• the quantum and form of possible capital grant support on offer such as expected 
sharing proportions, rate of return provisions and possible accelerations of return 
to maximise efficient use of capital; 
• project allocation approach, criteria, and integration with wider cluster selection 
processes; 
• providing guidance on delivery processes and timelines for these policies; and  
• further detail on the proposed risk allocation, in particular on demand risk.  
The following section outlines the current ‘minded-to’ position on the approach and structure to 
the proposed business model to support ICC in the UK. 
Annex E published alongside this document provides an early, indicative outline of the HoTs 
that an ICC Contract could follow and has been developed by the LCCC, coordinating with 
BEIS. 
 
Figure 7: the diagram above presents a simplified illustration of the funding mechanisms 
involved in the delivery of early ICC projects: 
 
61 
• capital co-funding grants will be available to support capital investment for initial ICC 
projects; 
• an ICC Contract will be agreed bilaterally (for initial projects) between the owner of the 
industrial facility (or third party acting on behalf of the industrial facility) and the defined 
HMG counterparty; 
• support payments covering operational expenses for running capture equipment, T&S 
fees, and providing a rate of return on capital investment, are made to the industrial 
facility;15 and 
• metering of carbon captured at different stages will allow appropriate accounting for 
operational payments, and monitoring the quality of gas injected into the T&S network. 
Business Model/Commercial Framework 
Terms 
The Contract: the ICC Contract whose proposed and provisional terms are laid out in this 
document and would be agreed between the owner of the industrial facility, or third party acting 
on behalf of the industrial facility, and the HMG appointed contract counterparty. 
Industrial Carbon Capture (ICC): the on-site capture components of the industrial application of 
carbon capture and storage, not including T&S infrastructure. 
Reference and Strike Price 
Our ‘minded-to’ position is that the reference price will follow a fixed trajectory, defined before 
the start of negotiations. The price could be analogous to the projected carbon market price for 
the contract lifetime, though not necessarily directly derived from it. This will allow the contract 
to predictably imitate the ‘avoided’ costs of the carbon price (i.e. those costs that the industrial 
facility would otherwise pay to buy allowances for their unabated emissions) as well as 
providing predictability of income and outlay for the installation of carbon capture on the 
industrial facility and the government respectively. Detail on how BEIS will set the trajectory will 
be set out in 2021. 
The industrial facility will be expected to give up some portion of its current free allowances 
under the ETS. This reflects that the plant should no longer need these allowances as the 
model offers protection from carbon market risks in respect of abated emissions16. Further 
work on treatment of free allowances will be set out in 2021. 
The strike price will be, in the first projects, negotiated bilaterally and should be based on, and 
reflective of, expected costs of carbon capture for the project (including the T&S fees and a 
 
15 Decisions on routing of T&S payments routed are to be decided in 2021; the illustration of T&S funding via the 
emitter is purely illustrative and we have also shown that T&S payments may be routed directly to the T&S 
operator from the contract counterparty.

return on the capex investment). We will set out further details on this process, including pre-
qualification criteria for entering into bilateral negotiations with BEIS. 
In this way, the overall outlay of the contract will be predictable. In advance of negotiations, 
HMG may set out banded strike prices per industrial sector to guide bilateral negotiations (and 
in future competitive allocation processes). 
We expect bidders to submit strike prices based upon the reference price, their costs of 
capture, avoided carbon costs and expected return for an investment of this risk profile. 
This model is designed to be applied to FOAK ICC projects in the UK; as the ecosystem for 
carbon capture in the UK is established and the low-carbon market matures, the model will 
similarly evolve to using the market price of carbon as the reference price for later projects. 
Similarly, for these later projects we intend that the strike price be set through competitive 
allocation, potentially via an auctioning process, though further work is needed to determine 
potential competitive allocation methods. 
Figure 8: Industrial Carbon Contract Model 
 
 
Our basis for considering this reference price approach was derived from a criteria 
assessment: 
• provides predictability for investors: this reference price option provides predictability 
for both investors and government for the lifetime of the contract and mitigates the 
uncertainty risk that both parties would face were the contract based on a fluctuating 
carbon price; 
• subsidy reduces over time: having the level of support decline over the lifetime of the 
contract will reduce outlay for government as the carbon price increases and low carbon 
products market develops and gradually normalise exposure to standard market 
conditions;

• cost effective in order to reduce overall cost to HM Government: the reference 
price should ensure that the minimum necessary level of subsidy is allocated to the 
industrial facility so as to achieve efficient allocation of public funds which represents 
value for money for the exchequer and should incentivise optimisation of technical and 
operational efficiencies;  
• provides a fair and cost reflective subsidy: the reference price should avoid the risk 
of the industrial facility receiving excessive (or insufficient) subsidy; 
• supports and is compatible with carbon pricing policy: the reference price approach 
should not contradict or undermine, in practice or principle, the UK’s current or future 
carbon pricing approach; 
• simplicity of implementation: basing the reference price on a pre-defined trajectory 
means that the payments are only dependent on the metered tonnage of CO₂ that is 
captured and transferred to the T&S network, simplifying the settlement process and 
reducing the administrative burden both for participants and the contract counterparty; 
and 
• provides cost certainty to the Exchequer: where possible, the reference price should 
provide the Exchequer with a predictable and controllable outlay. 
Payment 
The Contract will be paid on the basis of metered output of CO₂ entering the T&S network. No 
payment will be included for the general availability of the capture equipment. We consider that 
a payment on the basis of metered output of CO₂, covering opex and capex, will be easier to 
administer over the lifetime of the contract.  
T&S fees will be paid as part of the ICC Contract by the counterparty. In principle, the industrial 
facility will be protected from changes in T&S fees outside its control. Further work on T&S 
fees will be undertaken in 2021. 
We considered the alternative option of a payment based on the availability of the capture 
equipment in respect of the capex invested by the industrial facility but concluded that the 
availability of a CCUS-enabled industrial facility would be more difficult to measure than a 
power CCUS plant and could be prone to gaming.  
Contract Term 
The generic ICC Contract will have an overall duration of 15-years. We are minded for this to 
be based on a 10-year initial period covering operational expenses for running capture 
equipment, T&S fees, and a rate of return on capital investment. Following the end of this initial 
10-year period, there could be an additional period of 5 years that will only outlay operational 
costs and T&S fees. This could be delivered through either (i) an option for government and 
the industrial facility of a 5-year extension to an initial 10-year contract term, or (ii) an initial 
contract duration of 15-years, with a reopener on the strike price after the initial 10-year period 
which could take account of the carbon price and development of the low carbon products 
market in the UK by that time. Further work will follow in 2021 on the capex repayment period 
 
64 
within the 10-year period as well as the process for the contract extension or reopener at year 
10 to cover years 11-15. 
Following the completion of the Contract period(s), the expectation is that the market price of 
carbon and a sustainable and thriving low carbon products market means that the ICC project 
will continue to operate without further subsidy support from government. 
In considering contract length, we have taken account of a number of relevant factors, 
including the useful life of the asset and its possible accounting treatment, the potential 
timescale for transition to a subsidy free model, availability and cost of finance, value for 
money and affordability for government, and the implications for T&S. A 15-year term is the 
length of the standard CfD in the electricity market, providing a precedent for the overall 
duration of contract with which the government and the financial community are already 
familiar and comfortable. However, if we are accelerating capex repayment within the first 10 
years, this may have an impact on optimum contract length. We will make a final decision on 
this in 2021. 
Contract Counterparty 
The Contract will be a private law contract between a government-appointed counterparty to 
the Contract and the owner of the industrial facility or third party acting on behalf of the 
industrial facility. This counterparty is anticipated to be LCCC, subject to agreement and any 
necessary legal and administrative changes. Award of the contract under bilateral negotiations 
for initial projects will be on the direction of the BEIS Secretary of State. 
Subsidy Control 
The form of the revenue support for ICC projects is expected to be modelled as a subsidy, with 
contractual terms similar to those in the standard CfD contract, to ensure that participating UK 
industry is able to accommodate the costs associated with carbon capture. As such, the 
policies outlined in this document are provisional on compliance with the relevant applicable 
subsidy control regulations, including those being developed. 
Classification 
The policies and approach outlined here covering revenue and capital support and risk 
allocation are minded-to positions and will undergo further policy development, including a 
detailed analysis of the government balance sheet treatment and may therefore be subject to 
change. It is intended that the balance of risks and rewards associated with the ICC policies 
should lie in the majority with the private sector, reflecting that this programme is fundamentally 
a commercial endeavour, incentivised and supported by government intervention. 
Change in law 
In principle, the ICC Contract will contain change-in-law provisions, the form and scope of 
which remain to be determined, though are anticipated to be similar to those in the standard 
 
65 
CfD in the electricity market. Further detail will be set out as the contract is developed during 
2021. 
Technical arrangements 
Eligibility 
Existing industrial facilities retrofitting carbon capture (including modular carbon capture 
technology) and new industrial facilities with carbon capture technology intrinsic to the process 
will be eligible for an ICC Contract. The intention is for all carbon capture technologies to be 
applicable under the process, this includes post combustion, oxyfuel, pre combustion and 
emerging carbon capture technologies such as calcium looping, membranes, and others. We 
would expect a capture rate (efficiency) of at least 90% of the total flowrate of the flue gas 
stream to be achievable; however, work with technical advisors will define this in more detail in 
2021. 
Metering 
Accurate metering is important for determining the CO₂ capture rate, CO₂ quality and quantity 
of CO₂ captured from the industrial facility and sent for permanent storage. It is also important 
for ensuring accurate payments between parties across the CCUS chain. To meet these 
requirements, the quantity of CO₂ will need to be determined through metering at these points 
(whichever is appropriate for systems finalised upon): 
• the interface between the industrial facility and capture plant (for post-combustion 
capture) – if required by the industrial facility or if owned by a third party; and 
• the interface between the capture plant and the onshore transport network. 
In addition to metering the CO₂ flow rate, it is important to monitor the composition of the 
captured gas entering the T&S network. Other components beyond CO₂ can be captured as 
well, and the presence of contaminants, such as water, oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases, can 
damage downstream pipelines and potentially create issues for the storage site performance. 
Mechanisms will need to be in place to prevent contaminated CO₂ entering the T&S network.  
There will be further work to determine the specifics of metering requirements in 2021, 
particularly relating to specifics on the interfaces between the capture plant and the T&S facility 
and metering in other transportation methods.  
Consideration of risks 
Appropriate risk identification, mitigation, and allocation is critical to ensuring the success of 
ICC projects. This work has been undertaken with the central aim of achieving the right 
incentives, while ensuring that both the private sector and the government are not allocated 
risks that they cannot manage or price for.  
 
66 
Therefore, risks are allocated to the party considered best placed to manage each risk, noting 
that where this threatens the other objectives of CCUS, particularly in relation to ICC being 
financeable, deliverable, and providing value for money, some sharing of risk may be 
necessary. Our approach to risk allocation may evolve as the commercial frameworks mature. 
Based on this we have identified 54 risks grouped into core risks below. The following section 
details key risks relating to ICC, and our ‘minded-to’ position on these risks. Where our 
‘minded-to’ position remains outstanding, we have highlighted this. 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
Construction cost 
overruns 
There is a risk that the owner of the 
industrial facility and the supply 
chain do not have the skills and 
experience to deliver the carbon 
capture plant efficiently to cost 
predictions. 
Furthermore, the novelty of ICC 
means that it is challenging for the 
industrial facility to accurately 
predict capital expenditure, although 
this may be mitigated by detailed 
FEED studies. Therefore, there is a 
risk that there are construction cost 
overruns or savings beyond those 
projected when agreeing the ICC 
Contract and grant funding.  
Further analysis is ongoing, but 
our ‘minded-to’ position is, where 
HMG is providing capital co-
funding, to provide it as “last 
spend” incentivising industry to 
fully exploit other sources of 
capital first, with the HMG grant 
filling any gap between that and 
actual construction costs up to a 
capped amount. If this cap has 
not been reached, the remaining 
portion of the grant would be 
available to repay other sources 
of capital, subject to the grant not 
exceeding a pre-agreed 
percentage of total capital spend. 
 
 
67 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
Other 
construction risks 
Risk to the effective construction of 
the carbon capture plant due to: 
• damage to process plant 
during construction;  
• difficulty of delivering capture 
technology at the relevant 
site; 
• timing delays; and 
• incomplete construction. 
 
The industrial facility will bear the 
risk if there is damage to the 
process plant during construction 
of the carbon capture plant or if 
the carbon capture technology 
cannot be delivered at the 
relevant site.  
In the case of any timing delays, 
we are minded to provide 
flexibility through an appropriate 
Target Commissioning Window, 
with the industrial facility bearing 
the risks for any delays beyond 
this. Delay to completion could 
lead to T&S having no utilisation if 
the delayed user is the anticipated 
first user (i.e. user timing 
mismatch risk). If there are any 
delays as a result of 
unforeseeable circumstances, 
then a Force Majeure clause will 
allow an extension.  
The industrial facility will bear 
construction completion risk. The 
payments will not commence if 
the carbon capture facility’s 
construction is not completed.  
 
68 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
Operating risk: 
costs 
The operating costs for capture 
plants are likely to be significant and 
challenging to predict, particularly 
for first projects.  
This creates a risk for industrial 
carbon capture if the operational 
costs are materially higher or lower 
than forecast. If the subsidy fails to 
cover the additional operating costs 
of running abated then the plant 
may be incentivised to operate 
unabated, especially once the 
capital portion of the ICC Contract 
has ended. Conversely, the ICC 
Contract also risks over-payment if 
forecasted operating costs turn out 
to be much lower once the project is 
operational. 
Our ‘minded-to’ position is to 
provide a single operating 
expenditure reopener early on, 
once the project is in operation. 
This would incentivise 
management of this risk, whilst 
protecting against uncertainty in 
operating costs for FOAK ICC 
projects. The industrial facility will 
bear the risk of increased costs 
after the reopener, although 
consideration will be given to 
providing protection against 
inflation. Further work will be 
undertaken to determine the 
timing and process for the 
reopener. 
 
Operating 
performance risk 
There is uncertainty over the 
technological performance of the 
capture equipment and how this 
performance may change over time 
(linked to operating cost risk). For 
example, poor performance of the 
capture plant could result in CO₂ 
quality that is lower than the 
standard required by the T&S 
network. In addition, the CO2 
capture rate and plant efficiency 
could be lower than forecast. 
The industrial facility would bear 
this risk. The industrial facility 
would be required to operate 
continuous quality monitoring and 
emergency venting system to 
ensure that no out-of-specification 
CO₂ enters the T&S network. The 
industrial facility would also be 
responsible for ensuring minimum 
defined capture rates are met.  
 
 
69 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
Demand risk 
Risk that the industrial facility may 
have uncertain future demand for its 
goods and services, leading to 
uncertainty over the volume of 
carbon it will deliver to the T&S 
network. This includes where: 
• the industrial facility has 
lower demand for its primary 
goods or services than was 
forecast, resulting in 
less CO₂ delivered to 
T&SCo; and 
• the industrial facility has 
higher demand for its primary 
goods or services than was 
forecast, resulting in 
more CO₂ delivered to 
T&SCo. 
We are looking at a variety of 
options including: 
• for lower demand, we could 
potentially adjust payments 
to ensure continued returns 
on capex; 
• for higher demand, we will 
consider the viability of a 
capture cap, restricting 
payments above this cap.  
We will also need to consider 
further the impact on the T&S 
network for both higher and lower 
than estimated CO₂ volumes 
being captured by the industrial 
facility. 
Further detail on our approach to 
demand risk will be set out in 
2021, including the interaction 
with the forthcoming Industrial 
Decarbonisation Strategy and the 
development of the low carbon 
products market. 
User stranded 
asset 
If the T&S network fails to be 
constructed or is abandoned post-
commissioning, then the ICC project 
will become stranded. 
In the event that the T&S network 
is never completed, or completed 
to an unsatisfactory standard, the 
options are still being considered, 
but could include: 
• the industrial facility could 
be reimbursed for 
legitimate costs incurred, 
including the return of any 
carbon allowances 
forfeited. 
 
 
70 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
T&S unplanned 
outage 
Temporary unplanned or planned 
outage of T&S network. 
In the event of a T&S network 
outage, preventing the industrial 
facility from using the T&S 
network and causing captured 
CO₂ to be emitted to the 
atmosphere, the options are still 
being considered, but could 
include: 
• the industrial facility could 
continue to be paid for 
capturing carbon as agreed 
in the contract;  
• the industrial facility could 
be paid the capex return 
payment if the capture 
facility can be turned off; 
and 
• the contract payments 
could be extended by the 
period that the T&S 
network is out. 
T&SCo would bear the majority of 
unplanned outage risk. See T&S 
unplanned outage risk in Section 
3 for more details on the impact 
on T&SCo. 
T&S fees 
increase  
T&S fees charged to industrial 
facilities are increased. 
The industrial facility could be 
protected from an increase in T&S 
fees through a variety of potential 
measures. Further work on T&S 
fees will be undertaken in 2021.  
 
 
 
71 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
T&S timing 
mismatch 
T&S timing mismatch risk will arise 
if the commissioning of the T&S 
network is delayed beyond the 
commissioning dates of the 
industrial capture plant, with the 
capture plant unable to transport 
CO₂ while waiting for the T&S 
network to be completed. 
In the event that the T&S network 
is not completed in time for the 
completion of the capture plant, 
the approach is still under 
consideration, however, it could 
include:  
• the industrial facility could 
receive their payment for 
capturing carbon (post-
commissioning and/or 
dependent on capture 
technology), as agreed in 
the contract; 
• the Target Commissioning 
Window could be moved as 
agreed with the industrial 
facility in order to match 
commissioning T&S 
timelines. 
T&SCo would bear the majority of 
T&S construction overrun risk. 
See T&S construction delay risk 
in Section 3 for more details. 
 
72 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
T&S capacity 
constraint 
Lower than expected volumes of 
CO₂ available in the transport 
and/or storage facility either due to 
T&S network issues, or the capture 
plant injecting CO₂ into the T&S 
network at a rate greater than 
agreed, leading to the industrial 
facility and/or other industrial 
facilities being constrained. 
 
If industrial facilities are 
constrained by a fault in the T&S 
network, then industrial facilities 
could choose to either release 
CO₂ into the atmosphere (which 
would lead to a carbon cost) 
and/or have access to alternative 
injection route (e.g. onsite CO₂ 
storage vessels). The approach is 
still under consideration, but 
industrial facilities could be paid 
for the carbon captured in 
accordance with the contract. 
Industrial facilities will agree a 
capacity with the T&S network 
and a penalty will be applied to 
industrial facilities that cause a 
capacity constraint through over-
injection. 
T&SCo allowed revenue would be 
reduced if capacity level is lower 
than set target. See T&S capacity 
constraint risk in Section 3 for 
more details on the impact on 
T&SCo. 
Change in law or 
policy 
Change in law that impacts the 
costs or deliverability of carbon 
capture. 
The ICC Contract will set out 
appropriate provisions to protect 
the industrial facility from certain 
unforeseeable and material policy 
changes. 
 
73 
Risk  
Description 
Allocation 
Carbon policy 
and pricing 
Changes to the UK ETS or free 
allowances impact the commercial 
return of plant. 
Changes in carbon policies outside 
of UK. 
The industrial facility will not be 
exposed to changes in carbon 
price or free allowance policy in 
respect of the carbon that it 
captures once the contract has 
been signed. It remains exposed 
in respect to any residual 
emissions.  
Leakage risks 
Leakage of CO₂ from the industrial 
facility. 
The industrial facility is expected 
to be responsible for any leakage 
of CO₂ in their part of the network. 
Supply chain risk 
Supply chain does not have the 
capability or capacity to construct or 
operate the capture plant. 
The industrial facility is 
responsible for ensuring that 
contractors have the capability 
and capacity to construct and 
operate the facility. 
Decommissioning Decommissioning costs are higher/ 
lower than forecast. 
The industrial facility is unable to 
carry out the decommissioning 
process. 
The industrial facility is 
responsible for decommissioning 
capture plant in line with relevant 
industry standards. 
 
Commercial risk 
The industrial facility is unable to 
obtain financing on acceptable 
terms. 
The industrial facility has financial 
difficulties during the construction 
phase of the programme. 
The industrial facility is 
responsible for obtaining finance 
and managing its cashflows. 
 
Financing arrangements 
The CIF is currently under development and it is expected that this fund will, in part, support 
the capital funding of some early ICC projects and CO₂ T&S networks. This funding would be 
delivered as capital grants to support, in part, the capital cost of capture projects, with the 
 
74 
remainder funded through private investment sources and/or the industrial facility’s owner 
balance sheet (or a combination of both).  
Further details on the revenue mechanism to deliver industrial carbon capture through the ICC 
Contract will be set out in 2021. 
 
 
75 
Section 6: Update on hydrogen business 
models 
As an energy carrier with a range of potential different applications, low carbon hydrogen is 
expected to play an important role in our plans to reduce the UK’s carbon emissions and reach 
net zero by 2050. The Prime Minister’s recent Ten Point Plan included a number of 
commitments to drive the growth of low carbon hydrogen including: working with industry, with 
the aim of delivering 5GW of installed low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030; 
confirmation of the intent to publish a UK Hydrogen Strategy in 2021 and a £240 million Net 
Zero Hydrogen Fund to provide capital co-investment in early hydrogen production projects. 
Commitments also include a consultation in 2021 on hydrogen business models and plans to 
bring forward, next year, further details on the revenue mechanism to support them.  
In August 2020, the government published a response to the consultation on potential 
business models for CCUS. This confirmed our intention to develop business models to 
overcome the cost gap between low carbon hydrogen and higher carbon counterfactual fuels, 
one of the main barriers to adoption of low carbon hydrogen, and that business models will be 
aimed at supporting both CCUS-enabled and electrolytic hydrogen technologies. Alongside the 
consultation response, we published a BEIS-commissioned report from Frontier Economics 
into possible support mechanisms for large scale hydrogen producers17. Since then, we have 
been building on the work set out in both documents to identify a preferred way forward for low 
carbon hydrogen business model development.  
In August, we committed to providing a short update at the end of 2020 on our work to develop 
the commercial frameworks to bring through low carbon hydrogen projects, ahead of our 
planned consultation in 2021. This update does not cover government’s wider work on low 
carbon hydrogen, including development of the UK hydrogen strategy. 
As of today, hydrogen in the UK is primarily used as a feedstock in certain industrial processes 
and is not low carbon. In future, hydrogen produced via low carbon technologies has potential 
for a wide range of additional uses, such as mobility, high temperature process heat in 
industry, heat in buildings, energy storage and electricity generation.  
By 2050, we envisage a liquid, subsidy-free market for low carbon hydrogen competing with 
other low carbon energy technologies. However, in the intervening period, various market 
barriers will continue to exist. Overcoming the cost difference between low carbon hydrogen 
and the (higher carbon) counterfactual fuel is required to address some of these barriers and 
kick start creation of this potential future low carbon hydrogen market.  
Despite being a nascent sector, various low carbon hydrogen deployment proposals are being 
considered by energy market participants. These primarily include large scale CCUS-enabled

76 
projects as well as standalone electrolytic hydrogen projects and as stated above our intention 
is to support the development of both technologies. Some deployment proposals have a high 
number of interdependencies making it important for projects and policies across CCUS, 
electricity and low carbon hydrogen to develop in a coordinated manner.  
There are a range of policies aimed at decarbonisation across different end use sectors which 
could interact with any specific new commercial frameworks for low carbon hydrogen 
deployment. Examples include the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation in the mobility 
sector, the Green Gas Support Scheme in the heating sector, and the standard CfDs for low 
carbon electricity generation. We are mindful of the need to ensure consistency across 
policies, both between any new framework(s) and existing schemes, and also consistency 
regarding the future of existing policies which do or could have a bearing on deployment of low 
carbon hydrogen. 
Given the complexity of the low carbon hydrogen value chain, our twin track approach to 
supporting CCUS-enabled and electrolytic hydrogen, and the associated policy landscape, we 
intend to take a disaggregated approach to business model design. Different production 
technologies, project scales, and end uses have different technical and economic 
characteristics, and business model policy design needs to reflect these, i.e. there is unlikely to 
be a ‘one size fits all’ approach.  
That said, we consider that different parts of the low carbon value chain will need to develop in 
tandem to enable supply and demand to develop jointly. This will be particularly important in 
the first phase of market creation where risks, including demand risk and offtaker risk, are 
highest. We are considering the available options for producer and end user support to enable 
construction to start on low carbon hydrogen infrastructure projects in the early 2020s. Policy 
interventions are likely to vary depending on the specifics of particular deployment projects, 
including their production scale and target end users and we expect commercial frameworks to 
evolve over time to adapt to market developments. A key aim throughout will be avoiding 
double subsidies and ensuring an appropriate level of financial support. 
With respect to specific models, Frontier Economics concluded that producer subsidies 
through either a contractual or regulatory framework were most likely to incentivise investment 
in hydrogen production. Were this approach to be adopted, our view is that a contractual 
framework would be more appropriate than a regulatory framework, recognising the asset life 
of hydrogen production assets, the likely investor profile, and our long-term aim of a subsidy-
free market for low carbon hydrogen.  
We are aware of the different characteristics of large-scale centralised projects and small-scale 
distributed projects and are considering if separate mechanisms are needed for the latter and 
the feasible options if so.  
This work is also considering options around business model support for distribution and 
storage of low carbon hydrogen where we expect early projects to locate. It will be important to 
retain optionality of future hydrogen deployment beyond initial ‘point-to-point’ applications by 
 
77 
laying the foundations for establishment of a shared infrastructure to connect multiple 
producers and users (in addition to shared T&S networks). 
Other regulatory interventions will also be necessary at various points along the value chain 
and these are being taken forward in parallel to business model design. For example, we are 
progressing work on defining low carbon standards and are exploring options to enable 
blending of hydrogen into the existing gas grid. 
Any business models adopted will be subject to consultation with relevant stakeholders and 
compliance with subsidy control, fiscal rules and other relevant legislation. 
We aim to consult on a ‘preferred’ hydrogen business model, or models, in Q2 2021, in order 
to finalise in 2022. Alongside this, we will bring forward further details in 2021 on the revenue 
mechanism to support the business model(s). 
We will continue to engage with stakeholders via the Hydrogen Advisory Council, Hydrogen 
Business Models Expert Group, the investment community and directly with specific projects 
and organisations, and welcome stakeholders to discuss with us their considerations regarding 
business model policy development18.

Section 7: Next Steps 
This document reflects the work we have done to date to progress the business models design 
following publication of the business models consultation response document. We will continue 
to develop further the detailed structures and mechanisms of the power, T&S and industrial 
carbon capture business models in 2021 with the aim of having completed business models in 
place in 2022 as set out in the Ten Point Plan. 
We will continue to engage with prospective developers of T&S and CO₂ capture projects to 
refine the business models set out in this document. Following publication of this document we 
will undertake a series of targeted engagements with the financial community as potential 
investors in T&S and CO₂ capture projects. 
In order to provide further visibility on the intended development of the business models we are 
planning further updates during the course of 2021, set out below.
