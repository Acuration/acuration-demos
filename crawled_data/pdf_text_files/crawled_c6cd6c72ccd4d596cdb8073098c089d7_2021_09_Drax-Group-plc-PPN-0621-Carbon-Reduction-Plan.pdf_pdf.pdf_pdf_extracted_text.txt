Supplier name: Drax Group plc 
Publication date: 30 September 2021 
Commitment to achieving Net Zero 
Drax Group plc is committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050.  
Baseline Emissions Footprint 
Baseline emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases that have been produced in the 
past and were produced prior to the introduction of any strategies to reduce emissions. 
Baseline emissions are the reference point against which emissions reduction can be 
measured. 
  
Baseline Year: 2020 
Additional Details relating to the Baseline Emissions calculations.  
The current reported year (2020) is the baseline for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

Emissions reduction targets 
In order to continue our progress to achieving Net Zero, we have adopted the following carbon 
reduction targets. 
• 
Our ambition is to become carbon negative by 2030 (scope 1 and 2). 
• 
We are committed to the Science Based Targets initiative and have submitted the 
following targets for validation: “Drax Group plc commits to reducing its scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 42% and its scope 3 emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline 
(excluding emissions from downstream leased assets).” 
 
Carbon Reduction Projects 
Completed Carbon Reduction Initiatives 
The following environmental management measures and projects have been completed or 
implemented: 
• 
Since 2012, Drax Group has reduced its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by >85%. We 
have converted 4 of the 6 generating units at Drax Power Station to biomass, from coal. 
• 
Our UK Generation sites are certified through their respective management systems to 
ISO 14001:2015 and subject to regular external audit. 
• 
We are committed to the Science Based Targets initiative and have submitted the 
following targets for validation: “Drax Group plc commits to reducing its scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 42% and its scope 3 emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline 
(excluding emissions from downstream leased assets).” 
 
In the future we hope to implement further measures such as: 
 
• 
We are developing options for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). 
Subject to the right government support, the first BECCS unit at Drax Power Station could 
be operational in 2027 with a second in 2030, permanently removing at least 8 million 
tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.
