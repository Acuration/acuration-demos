INTRODUCTION 
2.1 
OVERVIEW 
2.1.1. 
This document is the Electrical Infrastructure Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF) Assessment for the Abergelli 
Power Project (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’).  It has been prepared by WSP on behalf of Abergelli 
Power Ltd. 
2.1.2. 
Abergelli Power Ltd is promoting a new Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station on 
rural land at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, near Swansea, Wales.  The Project provisionally includes the following 
electrical infrastructure, based on a single circuit turn-in connection: 
 400 kV transformer compound to be built adjacent to the proposed Generating Equipment Site 
 One three phase, 400 kV underground cable connection from the transformer compound to a gas-
insulated switchgear (GIS) bay at National Grid’s Swansea North Substation. 
2.1.3. 
Figure 1 shows the proposed location of the transformer compound to be built adjacent to the proposed 
Generating Equipment Site and the proposed single underground cable radial connection to Swansea North 
Substation. 
2.1.4. 
This report presents an assessment of the changes in EMFs that would result from the development of the 
new 400 kV electrical infrastructure. 
2.1.5. 
It is anticipated that some of the information included within this report will be used within the ‘Other Effects’ 
Chapter of the Environmental Statement.

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECTS 
 
3.1 
INTRODUCTION TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS 
3.1.1. 
Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs), and the associated electromagnetic forces, are a fundamental part of the 
physical world. Their sources are electric charges (source of the electric field) and the movement of those 
charges (source of the magnetic field). Electromagnetic forces are partly responsible for the cohesion of 
material substances and they mediate all the processes of chemistry, including those of life itself. EMFs occur 
naturally within the body in association with nerve and muscle activity. People are also exposed to the natural 
magnetic field of the Earth (to which a magnetic compass responds) and natural electric fields in the 
atmosphere.  
3.1.2. 
Electric-field strengths are measured in volts per metre (V/m) or kilovolts per metre (kV/m). One kilovolt per 
metre is one thousand volts per metre. The atmospheric electric field at ground level is normally between 10 – 
130 V/m in fine weather and may rise to many thousands of volts per metre during thunderstorms. The Earth’s 
electric field is referred to as static or “dc”. 
3.1.3. 
It has become common practice to report magnetic fields in units of microtesla (µT) or nanotesla (nT). One 
nanotesla is one thousandth of a microtesla. Microtesla is used throughout this chapter. Other units are 
sometimes quoted, for example milligauss, where 1 milligauss = 0.1 µT. 
3.1.4. 
The direction of the Earth’s magnetic field is normally constant, varying in size only slowly over time, and is 
referred to as a static or “dc” field. The Earth’s magnetic field is approximately 50 µT in the UK. Other fields 
that alternate in their intensity more frequently over time are referred to as alternating current or “ac” fields. 
3.1.5. 
All wiring, equipment, and other conductors connected to the electric power system are sources of ac EMFs 
with frequencies in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range. In the UK and Europe the fundamental power 
frequency is 50 Hertz (Hz). AC fields add to (or modulate) the Earth's steady natural fields. The strength (or 
amplitude) of the electric-field modulation depends on the voltage of the transmission equipment. As the 
voltage level supplied to power conductors is regulated, the electric field remains more or less constant as 
long as the equipment is energised. Conversely, the strength of the magnetic-field modulation depends on the 
current (often referred to as the load) carried by the equipment, which varies according to the demand for 
power at any given time. 
3.2 
EMF EXPOSURE GUIDELINES 
3.2.1. 
In the UK, there are presently no statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to power-frequency 
electric or magnetic fields. However, in 2004 the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) provided 
advice to Government [ref 1], recommending the adoption in the UK of guidelines published in 1998 by the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) [ref 2]. These guidelines are 
designed to set conservative exposure levels for the general public to 50 Hz electric and magnetic fields, and 
they are endorsed by Public Health England (formerly the Health Protection Agency, formerly NRPB), the 
World Health Organisation, and the UK Government. A summary of the 1998 ICNIRP guidelines for general 
public exposure is provided below in Table 1.

3.2.2. 
Item 1 in Table 1 indicates the ICNIRP ‘Basic Restriction’ which the EU recommend as the maximum current 
density to be inducted in the central nervous system of an individual [ref 3] . 
3.2.3. 
Current density, however, is a quantity that cannot realistically be measured in people, so Public Health 
England (formerly Health Protection Agency) also provided a second, more practical, guideline for EMF 
strengths as per item 2 in Table 1 which indicates field strength types that are measurable practically and the 
values considered to correspond to the ‘Basic Restriction’. 
3.2.4. 
Item 3 in Table 1, Reference Level field strengths, are yet more conservative values that would, under all 
normal circumstances, be expected to induce current densities significantly less than the ‘Basic Restriction’. 
Research by Dimbylow [ref 4] indicates that, for overhead power lines, the field strengths quoted as 
corresponding to the ‘Basic Restriction’ (item 2) act as good, if slightly conservative, equivalents to the 1998 
ICNIRP Basic Restriction for the general public, and for this reason the ‘Basic Restriction’ figures in item 2 of 
Table 1 are generally considered more relevant to overhead lines than the ‘Reference Level field strengths’ of 
item 3. 
3.2.5. 
The UK has implemented the EU recommendation [ref 3], and has stated that compliance with the general 
public exposure limits is considered to be required at locations where the public may spend significant time, for 
example residential buildings, as defined in the UK Voluntary Code of Practice [ref 5]. It is the policy of 
National Grid to ensure that all new assets comply with public exposure guidelines unless there are 
exceptional circumstances.

APPRAISAL METHODOLOGY 
 
4.1 
GENERAL  
4.1.1. 
The appraisal methodology has been based upon the industry Code of Practice on Compliance [ref 5] which 
specifies that compliance should be specifically demonstrated for 400 kV underground cables. Conversely, it 
recognises that some equipment is inherently compliant with exposure guidelines and appropriate evidence is 
maintained on the Energy Networks Association (ENA) website1,2. The evidence hosted on the ENA website 
demonstrates that the transformer compound, which does not include air-cored reactors, is inherently 
compliant. 
4.1.2. 
In this present assessment, electric and magnetic field strengths due to the existing nearby overhead line and 
proposed underground cable were calculated using standard equations based on fundamental properties. All 
electric and magnetic fields were calculated based upon guidance outlined in the aforementioned Code of 
Practice. Accordingly, the calculations of EMF are always referenced to a height of 1 m above ground level. 
4.1.3. 
Mention of field strengths later in this document will mean the root-mean-square amplitude of the power-
frequency modulation of the total field, which is the conventional way of expressing these quantities.  
4.1.4. 
The acceptability of the prospective field strengths was judged by comparing the results of the calculations 
with the appropriate ICNIRP guidelines. 
4.1.5. 
High-voltage transmission lines can create, or channel, electromagnetic emissions over a wide range of 
frequencies, however, this report only considers 50 Hz electromagnetic fields. 
4.2 
ELECTRIC FIELDS 
4.2.1. 
The electric field due to the transformer compound is inherently compliant with the public exposure limits as 
discussed in section 4.1. Electric fields diminish within the vicinity of earthed objects and structures. The 
proposed transformer compound would be surrounded by an earthed metal fence and consequently the 
electric field outside of this fence would certainly comply with ICNIRP exposure guidelines for the public. 
4.2.2. 
There are no external electric fields associated with underground cables as explained in the BICC Electric 
Cables Handbook [ref 6].  Electric fields associated with underground cable are contained by the sheath of the 
cable itself. The public would thus not be exposed to electric fields from the proposed underground cables. 
4.3 
MAGNETIC FIELDS 
4.3.1. 
Some equipment within the transformer compound would produce magnetic fields, but these fields tend to 
diminish rapidly with increasing distance from the equipment. Magnetic fields outside the transformer 
compound due to these items of equipment are inherently compliant with public exposure limits, as discussed 
in section 4.1.  
4.3.2. 
There will be a magnetic field due to the underground cable from the cable sealing ends beside the existing 
overhead line to the proposed transformer compound. 
4.4 
BASELINE CONDITIONS 
4.4.1. 
The existing 400 kV 4YW overhead line from Swansea to Clifynydd passes close to the route of the cable 
between the proposed transformer compound and the point of connection at Swansea North substation. The 
field strengths due to this L6 tower transmission line have been calculated to compare with those associated 
with the Project. Detailed overhead line parameters are tabulated in Appendix A.  
4.4.2. 
The pre-fault continuous current rating of the existing 400 kV 4YW overhead line is 3180 MVA corresponding 
to 4590 Amps.

4.4.3. 
Table 2 presents the calculated maximum field strengths due to the existing 400 kV 4YW overhead line. These 
are based upon the surveyed minimum ground clearance (9.4 metres) for the 400 kV conductors in the nearby 
spans (spans between towers 252-253 and 253-254). The field strengths corresponding to the ICNIRP public 
exposure basic restriction are also included in the table. It may be seen that the maximum field strengths due 
to the existing 400 kV 4YW overhead line comply with the basic restriction levels.

IMPACT APPRAISAL 
4.5.1. 
The fields due to the transformer compound are inherently compliant. 
4.5.2. 
The impact appraisal has included evaluation of the maximum field strengths due to the 400 kV underground 
cable connection from the transformer compound to National Grid’s Swansea North substation. 
4.5.3. 
For the purposes of this appraisal, the calculations have assumed that the current flowing in each phase of the 
proposed underground cable is 477 Amps. This assumption corresponds to operating at a minimum voltage of 
380 kV (95% x 400 kV) and the maximum export from the generator which is to be rated at 314 MVA. 
4.5.4. 
Detailed parameters including the assumed cable laying arrangement are provided in Appendix A. 
4.5.5. 
Calculated maximum field strengths are tabulated in Table 3. 
4.5.6. 
Since the proposed underground cable from the transformer compound to National Grid’s Swansea North 
Substation does not produce an external electric field, the expected maximum electric field strength above the 
cable will be due to the existing nearby 400 kV 4YW overhead line. 
4.5.7. 
The prospective maximum magnetic field strength due to the proposed underground cable circuit from the 
transformer compound to National Grid’s Swansea North Substation is below the public exposure basic 
restriction level and is significantly less than that due to the existing 400 kV 4YW line.   
4.5.8. 
There is potential for the magnetic field due to the proposed underground cable circuit from the transformer 
compound to National Grid’s Swansea North substation to add to that of the existing 4YW overhead line 
because the proposed cable route passes underneath the existing overhead line. These magnetic fields are 
vectors which vary in magnitude and direction because they come from different sources. The theoretical 
maximum sum of the fields is calculated by adding the field magnitudes arithmetically corresponding to both 
fields being totally aligned. The average of the combined fields, corresponding to the fields being at right 
angles, would be less and calculated as the root sum of the squares of the field magnitudes. Based on the 
magnetic field values given in Table 3, the maximum sum of the fields is 85.4 µT (82.3 + 3.1) and is below the 
public exposure basic restriction level.

MITIGATION / BEST PRACTICE 
4.6.1. 
Since the calculated prospective maximum electric and magnetic field strengths expected due to the 
underground cable connection fall within the ICNIRP EMF exposure guidelines, the development designs 
would be considered to follow best practice for electricity transmission installations as defined in the UK 
Voluntary Code of Practice [ref 5]. As the proposed development complies with the current public exposure 
guidelines, EN-5 [ref 7] states that "no further mitigation should be necessary". 
4.7 
SUMMARY 
4.7.1. 
Although the maximum magnetic field strengths due to the proposed underground cable connection is greater 
than that due to the existing overhead line running nearby the proposed cable route, it is within nationally and 
internationally accepted guidelines. 
4.7.2. 
The change in the electric and magnetic field strengths due to the establishment of the transformer compound 
would constitute a ‘Minor’ effect.
