INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for the proposed 
Abergelli Power Project (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’). The PEIR 
has been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff on behalf of Abergelli Power 
Limited (APL). 
1.1.2 
The Project proposed is a gas-fired ‘peaking’ plant which is designed to 
operate when there is a surge in demand for electricity associated with 
a particular stress event (e.g where there is a sudden demand in power 
required by consumers or a sudden drop in power being generated by 
plants which are constantly operational such as a sudden outage).  The 
principal elements of the Project are:  
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle 
Gas Turbine (SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating 
station fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing a rated 
electrical output of 50 - 299 Megawatts (MW) comprising:  
o 
The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine 
Generators and Balance of Plant which are located on 
the Generating Equipment Site (see Figure 1.3); 
o 
A new purpose built Access Road either from the Rhyd-
y-pandy Road to the north (Access Road – Option 1) or 
the B4489 to the west (Access Road – Option 2) to the 
Generating Equipment Site; and  
o 
During construction a temporary construction compound 
(the Laydown Area).   
 
A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS); and 
 
A new Electrical Connection to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS). 
1.1.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are 
together known as the Power Generation Plant, and are located within 
the Power Generation Plant Site.   
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
are all integral to the generation of electricity’. The land upon which the 
Abergelli Power Project

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to 
facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project 
Site’ (see Figure 1.1 and 1.2). Diagram 1.1 shows how the elements of 
the project relate to each other. 
 
Diagram 1.1: Project Description  
1.1.5 
The Project would be situated on farmland located north of Swansea 
within the administrative area of the City and County of Swansea Council 
(CCS), approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 m west of 
Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach (see Figure 1.1). The 
approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 
201431. 
1.1.6 
The Project is described in more detail in Chapter 2, including the options 
currently under consideration for the Access Road. 
1.2 
Purpose and Structure of the PEIR 
1.2.1 
Preliminary Environmental Information is defined in the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 as:  
‘information referred to in Part 1 of Schedule 4 (information for inclusion 
in environmental statements) which: 
(a) has been compiled by the applicant; and 
(b) is reasonably required to assess the environmental effects of the 
development (and of any associated development)’. 
1.2.2 
The purpose of the PEIR is to enable consultees, including the local 
community, to understand the environmental effects of the Project so 
they can provide a comprehensive response.

1.2.3 
This document presents the environmental information collected to date 
and an assessment, on a preliminary basis, of the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project.  The planned activities which still 
need to be undertaken to complete the EIA include:   
 
concluding baseline environmental surveys;  
 
completing the assessment of the Project and confirming the final 
design, informed by, inter alia, feedback from stakeholders and 
public consultation; and 
 
designing possible mitigation to address adverse effects. 
1.2.4 
Once complete, the findings of the EIA will be reported in full in the 
Environmental Statement (ES) to be submitted with the Application for a 
Development Consent Order (refer to Section 1.3). 
1.2.5 
The PEIR is structured in a similar way to the way the ES will be 
structured.  Chapter 2 provides a description of the Project and the 
elements that are currently known.  Chapter 3 provides a brief summary 
of the legislation and policy relevant to the EIA of the Project. Chapter 4 
describes the generic methodology to be used in assessing the likely 
significant environmental effects.  Chapter 5 describes the alternatives 
considered so far in the design of the Project.  Chapters 6 to 14 set out 
the methodology, baseline information collected so far and preliminary 
assessment of likely significant environmental effects for each specialist 
topic area, including the cumulative effects.  Chapter 15 provides a brief 
summary and conclusion.  
1.3 
Application for a Development Consent Order 
1.3.1 
In Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is considered to be a 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the Planning 
Act 20081 (PA 2008) if its generating capacity is more than 50 MW. As 
the proposed Power Generation Plant will have an electrical generating 
capacity of at least 50 MW, it will be classified as a NSIP under Section 
14(1)a and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008. Under Section 31 of the PA 
2008, a Development Consent Order is required for development that is 
or forms part of a NSIP and therefore it is intended that an Application 
for a Development Consent Order will be submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate for examination on behalf of the Secretary of State (SoS). 
1.4 
Consultation Strategy 
Non-Statutory Consultation

1.4.1 
Informal public consultation was carried out on 19th to 21st June 2014 
through public exhibitions at Clydach, Felindre and Tircoed.   
Statutory Consultation 
1.4.2 
Statutory pre-application consultation with those living in the vicinity of 
the Project is a requirement under section 47 of the PA 2008. This PEIR 
has been published in the manner described in the Applicant’s Statement 
of Community Consultation (SoCC), which explains how APL proposes 
to consult people living in the vicinity of the Project. The SoCC also 
explains how feedback can be given about the Project and the content 
of this PEIR. The SoCC is available on the APL website 
(www.abergellipower.co.uk). 
1.4.3 
Public exhibitions will be held at Llangyfelach, Felindre, Clydach and 
Tircoed between 22nd and 25th October 2014. 
1.4.4 
The Project is still being developed and refined.  Feedback received 
during the consultation process will help inform the development of the 
Project and the decisions on its design still to be made. 
1.4.5 
Under Section 42 (‘Duty to Consult’) of the PA 2008, there is a duty 
placed on developers to consult certain prescribed bodies as well as 
local communities. In this respect, APL first met CCS to discuss the 
Project in April 2014 and will continue to consult with them throughout all 
phases of the Project. 
1.4.6 
All representations made during the consultation process are being 
considered carefully and APL will have regard to all relevant responses 
prior to submission of the Application for a Development Consent Order. 
The consultation process will be described in the Consultation Report to 
be submitted with the Application. 
1.5

1.5.3 
WPL currently has two other 299 MW projects being brought forward 
through the planning process. They are Progress Power Ltd at Eye 
Airfield in Suffolk (www.progresspower.co.uk) and Hirwaun Power Ltd at 
Hirwaun in South Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk). Both projects are 
now in the examination phase following acceptance of the Applications 
for Development Consent Orders by the Planning Inspectorate. 
1.5.4 
WPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. APL recognises the need 
to balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and 
concerns of energy projects and believes this can be responsibly 
delivered at a local level. The Project and supporting infrastructure will 
be designed and developed to high quality, safety and environmental 
standards.

1.6 
Needs and Benefits of the Project 
1.6.1 
There is considerable national need for this type of development, 
acknowledged at all levels of Government policy. National planning 
policy supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the 
current ageing and inevitable closure of older coal fired power plants and 
the likely increase in demand for electricity over the coming decades.  
1.6.2 
The overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1)2 
states that ‘gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-
carbon generation and to maintain security of supply’ (paragraph 3.6.2).  
1.6.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as 
being essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s 
energy security. In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project 
provide back-up to power generation from renewable sources, 
particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired power plants are among the 
most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity power generation.   
1.6.4 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to 
the nature of the electricity generation mix on the NETS. There is 
therefore a clear and significant requirement for further capacity to meet 
the projected need for reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated gas fired 
peaking plant such as the Project could allow for the rapid provision of

PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
The Project Site and elements of the Project are described below. The 
description is based on a ‘Rochdale Envelope’ approach (i.e. a single 
project with a range of parameters). The scope of each of the technical 
assessments has been based on the parameters provided below. 
Assessing a worst-case realistic configuration from within the 
parameters enables an assessment of the ‘realistic worst case’ likely 
significant environmental effects within each technical assessment. 
Section 4.9 below explains the approch to identifying and assessing the 
worst case scenario for each topic chapter in this PEIR. It is 
acknowledged that the parameters may be refined during the design 
process for the Project and as a consequence of the feedback received 
following consultation. If this occurs the modified parameters will be 
described and taken into account in the EIA as appropriate. 
2.2 
The Project Site 
2.2.1 
The Project Site (see Figure 1.1) is located on farmland north of 
Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 m west of 
Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The land is currently used 
for sheep and horse grazing as well as horse training and breeding. The 
western extent of the Project Site encompasses National Grid’s 
‘Swansea North’ electrical substation (comprising a 132kv and 400kv 
substation) and Felindre Gas Compressor Station. In addition, areas 
within the Project Site have, in the past, been subject to a variety of 
permissions for mineral extraction, inert landfill and other commercial 
activities. 
2.2.2 
The Project Site will be accessed from Junction 46 of the M4.   From the 
M4 there are two access options being considered at this stage (as 
shown in Figure 1.1 and Diagram 2.1): Option 1 from the north via the 
Rhyd-y-pandy Road utilising the existing farm road which runs 
north/south through Abergelli Farm; or Option 2 from the west via the 
B4489 utilising the existing National Grid road and then via agricultural 
land to the west of the Generating Equipment Site and land following the 
southern boundary of the Gas Compressor Station. 
2.2.3 
Ground levels at the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m AOD in 
the north-west corner to 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter with 
ground levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction 
towards the Afon Llan and its tributaries.

2.2.4 
The Power Generation Plant Site will be located primarily within fields 
used for grazing bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and 
defunct hedgerows with substantial gaps in them. The Generating 
Equipment Site and Laydown Area are divided into two areas by a soft 
surface horse training track known as ‘the gallops’ with a block of 
broadleaved woodland to the east classified as Ancient Woodland and a 
Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). There are also 
further blocks of Ancient Woodland to the west surrounding Swansea 
North electrical substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the 
access road leading to these facilities from the B4490. The land within 
the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m above 
Ordnance Datum (AOD) and gently slopes down towards the south. 
2.2.5 
The Gas Connection will follow a route corridor as shown on Figure 1.1 
and Diagram 2.1 located to the north of the Generating Equipment Site 
crossing grazing fields bound by hedgerows and ditches. It will vary 
between 30 m and 100 m in width depending on the working area 
required.  The fields are interspersed by small deciduous copses, some 
of which are classified as Ancient Woodland and SINCs to the north, 
northeast and northwest of the Generating Equipment Site, as identified 
on Figure 8.1 and 8.2.   
2.2.6 
The Electrical Connection will follow a route corridor of approximately 30 
m in width identified in Figure 1.1 and Diagram 2.1. It will be located to 
the southwest of the Generating Equipment Site passing through grass 
fields and following the southern boundary of the Gas Compressor 
Station.

The Surrounding Area 
2.3.1 
The area surrounding the Project Site is partly rural with some urban 
fringe development (e.g. Park and Ride Facilities) and a substantial 
amount of utilities infrastructure in the area. Gas NTS Pipelines, and a 
water pipeline cross the Project Site and there is also a network of 
electricity pylons which lead to and from National Grid’s two electrical 
substations to the southwest of Abergelli Farm. Furthermore a Water 
Treatment Works is located to the northwest while the Cefn Betingau 
Solar Park is located to the east of Project Site.   
2.3.2 
The closest residential dwellings to the Project Site are:  
 
Abergelli Farmhouse approximately 620 m to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site;  
 
Llwynhelig approximately 590 m to the south east of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
 
Felin Wen Farm approximately 830 m to the east of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
 
Lletty Morfil Farm approximately 740 m to the west of the 
Generating Equipment Site;  
 
Cefn-betingau approximately 650 m to the north east of the 
Generating Equipment Site; and  
 
Maes-eglwys approximately 440 m to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site.   
2.3.3 
These dwellings are identified on Figure 1 of Appendix 7.1 as Noise 
Sensitive Receptors. 
2.3.4 
Within the Project Site there is a small landfill and the remains of Aber-
gelli Colliery, both of which are located north of Abergelli Farmhouse.  
2.3.5 
Other features of the area include a number of existing public footpaths, 
bridleways and tracks located in and around the Project Site, linking it to 
the wider area. In addition, within the Project Site there are a number of 
springs with their associated streams and drainage ditches which 
discharge into the Afon Llan.  The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and 
the River Loughor, which discharges into the Bristol Channel. 
2.4 
Relevant Planning History 
2.4.1 
Abergelli Farm has previously been subject to a series of planning 
applications for mineral extraction, inert landfill and other commercial 
activities.

2.4.2 
Swansea City Waste Disposal Company Ltd gained planning permission 
for ‘excavation and removal of inert material from landfill site and 
restoration’ at Abergelli Farm in February 2003 (CCS Ref: 2002/0312).  
This consent was subsequently extended to allow the excavation and 
removal of inert material until 31st December 2010 (2007/0907). 
2.4.3 
In May 2003, planning permission was granted for the change of use of 
land at Abergelli Farm from agricultural use to a horse racing 
training/facility ground (CCS Ref: 2003/0561).  Subsequently, CCS 
granted planning permission for the construction of a stable block in 
August 2004 (CCS Ref: 2004/0415) and for the construction of two 
detached dwelling houses to provide Horse Trainers and Stable Hands 
accommodation (CCS Ref: 2004/0329). 
2.4.4 
Abergelli Glas Ltd gained planning permission for a 10MW solar farm at 
land at Abergelli Farm, adjacent to the north-east of the Project Site, in 
May 2013 (CCS Ref: 2013/0135).  This consent has since been the 
subject of a Non-Material Amendment (NMA) application to reduce the 
number of buildings, solar panels, height of fence, height of framework 
and to omit the met mast (SCC Ref: 2014/1313/NMA). 
2.4.5 
As a result of recent planning applications, the Project Site at Abergelli 
Farm currently comprises fields and farmland used for sheep and horse 
grazing as well as horse training and breeding. 
2.4.6 
The area surrounding the Project Site is predominantly rural but is 
characterised by a substantial amount of utilities infrastructure.   
2.4.7 
In August 2008, National Grid Electricity Transmission PLC gained 
planning permission for the construction of a new 400kV electricity 
substation at a site approximately 1km to the south-west of the Project 
Site, at Heol Llangyfelach in Felindre, (CCS Ref: 2007/2733).  
Subsequently, the proposals were modified and planning permission 
was granted for the amended scheme in November 2008 (CCS Ref: 
2008/1685).  In association with the 400kV electricity substation, 
planning permission was granted for an overhead electricity line 
diversion in April 2008 (CCS Ref: 2007/2827) the construction of an 
amenity building in July 2010 (CCS Ref: 2010/0539). 
2.4.8 
A 9 MW solar park, consisting of 135,000 PV panels, 9 
inverter/transformer cabins and a single control building at land at Cefn 
Betingau Farm, approximately 1.5km to the south-east of the Project 
Site, was granted planning permission in August 2013 (CCS Ref: 
2013/0865).

2.5 
Power Generation Plant 
2.5.1 
The Generating Equipment will be designed as a SCGT peaking plant.  
A peaking plant is designed to operate when there is a surge in demand 
for electricity associated with a particular stress event (e.g. where may 
people across the country boil kettles following the end of a popular 
television programme or where there is a sudden drop in power being 
generated from plants which are constantly operational such as a 
sudden outage).  It will be fired by natural gas supplied by a new 
underground gas pipeline connecting the Power Generation Plant to the 
existing NTS. It will have a rated electrical output of between 50 - 299 
MW (enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes).  
2.5.2 
The main equipment in a SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising 
the following components:  
 
Inlet air filter; 
 
Air compressor; 
 
Combustion chamber; 
 
Power turbine(s); and  
 
Exhaust silencer.   
2.5.3 
Air on entering the gas turbines, will be compressed and natural gas 
injected into the air. The natural gas will then burn in the combustion 
chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas will then expand 
across the blades of the gas turbine driving the electrical generators to 
produce electricity.   
2.5.4 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process will then be 
released to the atmosphere via between one and five stacks (chimneys). 
The stack(s) will contain equipment which will reduce emissions released 
to the atmosphere.  Diagram 2.2 shows a simple schematic of a SCGT 
operation.

2.5.5 
The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site will be 6 ha. The 
Generating Equipment may be sited in a number of locations within the 
wider Generating Equipment Site depending on its final design. The 
Generating Equipment Site may also be reduced in size during the 
design process with any changes acknowledged in the ES.  Table 2.1 
provides indicative dimensions for the main plant items which will be 
present at the Generating Equipment Site.

2.5.6 
A temporary Laydown Area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction will be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site 
as shown in Figure 1.1. It is not proposed that land will be required for a 
permanent maintenance/laydown area during operation.   
2.5.7 
A new purpose built Access Road will be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site. Two options are being considered for access to 
the Generating Equipment Site via Junction 46 of the M4 (see Section 
2.11). 
2.6 
Gas Connection 
2.6.1 
The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new underground gas 
pipeline connection (the Pipeline) and above ground installation (AGI) 
and is required to connect the Generating Equipment to the existing high 
pressure NTS Pipeline (Feeder 28) in order to provide a reliable supply 
of fuel. 
2.6.2 
Connection of the Pipeline to the NTS will require an Above Ground 
Installation (AGI) to be installed which will comprise: a Minimum Offtake 
Connection (MOC) facility, which will be owned by National Grid 
Company (NGC); and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) Trap Facility 
(PTF) which will be owned by APL. 
2.6.3 
The MOC (approximately 40 m x 30 m) will contain: 
 
Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
2.6.4 
The PTF (approximately 40 m x 30 m) will contain:  
 
PIG launching facility;

 
Emergency control valve (possible); 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and  
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
2.6.5 
Termination of the Gas Connection will be at a PTF on the Generating 
Equipment Site. A further facility known as the Gas Receiving Facility 
(GRF) will be situated downstream of the PTF within the Generating 
Equipment Site. The PTF will contain the following equipment:  
 
PIG receiving facility;  
 
Emergency control valve (possible); and  
 
Isolation valves.  
2.6.6 
The GRF will contain the following equipment:  
 
Metering, 
heating, 
filtering, 
compression 
and 
pressure 
regulation equipment; 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Electricity supply kiosk; and  
 
Control and instrumentation kiosks. 
2.6.7 
The PTF and GRF will be sited close to each other and if possible they 
will be joined on a single plot. 
2.6.8 
The AGI (both the MOC and PTF) will be located in the north of the 
Project Site, on the southern side of the Rhyd-y-pandy road leading to 
Felindre.  Once complete, maintenance access will be taken from that 
road.  The Gas Connection will then follow a route corridor shown on 
Figure 1.1 running in southerly direction to the Generating Equipment 
Site.  It will be approximately 1.4 km in length.  It will cross the NTS in 
two locations. 
2.6.9 
The laying of the Gas Connection will involve the excavation of a trench, 
temporary stockpiling of the soil and then subsequent backfilling with 
soil. 
2.7 
Electrical Connection 
2.7.1 
The Electrical Connection will comprise all the necessary elements to 
enable power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the 
NETS such as new electrical circuits in the form of an underground cable.  
The terminal point between National Grid and APL is assumed to be the 
Abergelli Power Project

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
400kV circuit breaker in the Swansea North 400kv substation.  The 
Electrical Connection will be approximately 900 m in length. 
2.7.2 
The route (see Figure 5.1) leaves the Generating Equipment Site 
passing through farmland to the east and south-east of the National Grid 
Gas Compressor Station.  The route crosses into National Grid’s land to 
the east of tower 4YW251 heading towards the National Grid Swansea 
North substation.  Once within National Grid’s land the Electrical 
Connection turns to the north-west to run outside the substation and 
parallel with the substation fence line through what is understood to have 
been part of the site works area during construction.  The Electrical 
Connection then turns into the substation close to the northern corner. 
2.7.3 
The route is known to pass under 400 kV overhead transmission lines 
and under wood pole overhead distribution lines.  The route crosses 
watercourses, in the form of streams or drainage ditches, at a number of 
locations.  The route is understood to cross a local transmission service 
high pressure gas pipeline within the field to the east of tower 4YW251; 
this crossing will be at close to a right-angle. 
2.7.4 
It is anticipated that the underground cable circuit will be installed using 
a single open cut trench along the route. Where the route enters National 
Grid land it may be necessary, due to the slope, and crossing of a 
watercourse and hedgerow, for the cable to be installed underground by 
directional drilling, for around 70 m in length. Directional drilling is used 
to avoid obstacles.  A bore is made between two points on the surface 
and a polymeric pipe is pulled through to form a duct.  The cable can 
then be pulled into the duct.   
2.7.5 
Due to the change in elevation, a special cable support construction, 
such as the use of clamps with cable snaking to support the weight of 
the cable up the slope, may be required where the route rises from the 
boundary of the National Grid substation to the north-east corner of the 
substation. Within the National Grid substation it is likely that the cables 
will be installed in filled surface troughs. 
2.7.6 
The Electrical Connection will cross an existing Public Right of Way 
(PRoW) shown on Figure 12.4.  During construction, a bridge will be 
installed so that disruption to the users of the PRoW will be minimised. 
2.8 
Carbon Capture Readiness and Carbon Capture and Storage 
2.8.1 
With a rated electrical output of less than 300MW, the Project will be 
below the threshold set out in Directive 2009/31/EC3 (as transposed by

when operators of combustion plants are required to have assessed the 
feasibility of: a storage site, transport facilities and economic 
considerations of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a 
result of the combustion process. Therefore it is not considered 
necessary to assess the viability of CO2 capture or include it further in 
this report. 
2.9 
Waste 
2.9.1 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be 
prepared for approval by the local authority prior to commencement of 
construction. Measures for controlling waste will include, amongst 
others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and testing for Waste 
Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used on- or off-
site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from de-
watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
2.9.2 
All construction waste will be dealt with in a manner that complies with 
relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project Site) waste will be 
treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. 
2.9.3 
The laying of the Electrical Connection will involve the excavation of a 
trench or directional drilling, temporary stockpiling of the soil and then 
subsequent backfilling with soil. No significant surplus waste materials 
are expected to arise from this activity. 
2.9.4 
The laying of the Gas Connection will involve the excavation of a trench, 
temporary stockpiling of the soil and then subsequent backfilling with 
soil, and the construction of the AGI. No significant surplus waste 
materials are expected to arise from this activity. 
2.9.5 
Small amounts of solid waste will arise from the Power Generation Plant 
during operation and will include both hazardous and non-hazardous in 
nature. 
2.9.6 
Final types and volumes have not yet been confirmed but will be 
restricted to the following: 
 
General office wastes; 
 
Used gas turbine air intake filters. These are typically replaced 
annually for generating station operating constantly and hence 
will require much less frequent replacement for a 1,500 
hour/year peaking plant as proposed; 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
 
Other miscellaneous wastes; 
 
Small quantities of water from compressor blade washing; 
 
Separated oil/sludge from any oil/water separators on site; and 
 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
2.9.7 
Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste from the above list 
will be stored on the Generating Equipment Site at any time (final types 
and volumes have not yet been confirmed). Such substances will be held 
in secured containers to prevent contaminant migration. All waste 
management practices will be in full accordance with regulatory 
requirements and with industry best practice. Waste will be treated and 
disposed of by licensed contractors. 
2.9.8 
No waste is predicted to arise during the operational phase from the 
Electrical and Gas Connections. 
2.9.9 
A range of waste types are likely to arise during decommissioning and 
will include materials such as structural steel, metal cladding and roofing, 
and block and concrete waste, all of which will be suitable for recovery 
and reuse or recycling. Redundant Generating Equipment will include 
turbines, ducting and pipework, generators and associated machinery 
and controls. These will be dominated by valuable metals and other 
materials suitable for specialist commercial recycling and could also 
involve re-use of equipment elsewhere. It is not predicted that significant 
quantities of residual waste requiring disposal will arise. 
2.9.10 
It is proposed that the cabling associated with the Electrical Connection 
will be left in-situ following end of use. It is proposed that the buried 
pipework, and cabling associated with Gas Connection will be left in-situ 
following end of use. The AGI will be decommissioned and left in situ. 
The MOC will remain live in case it is reused in the future, but everything 
downstream will be isolated from it.  All below ground pipework will be 
nitrogen purged and capped. 
2.9.11 
There is good provision of waste management capacity in South West 
Wales to cover all types of waste arisings. The most up to date 
information is from the Regional Waste Plan 1st Review4 (Neath Port 
Talbot County Borough Council (co-ordinating authority), August 2008). 
2.9.12 
All wastes generated as part of the operational phase will be handled 
and stored under appropriate waste management legislation e.g. 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010.

Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs) 
2.10.1 
There are no external electric fields associated with underground cables 
as explained in the BICC Electric Cables Handbook5. Electric fields 
associated with underground cable are contained by the sheath of the 
cable itself. The public will thus not be exposed to electric fields from the 
proposed underground cables associated with the Project.

2.11.2 
Car parking will be provided within the compound of the Generating 
Equipment Site during construction and decommissioning. The Project 
will consider the Council’s policy on parking standards during the 
operational phase of the Project and consider sustainable transport 
methods. 
2.11.3 
It is estimated that the construction and decommissioning phases will 
result in approximately 200 car or van trips per day and around 150 HGV 
deliveries per day during the peak construction/decommissioning period. 
This assumes a 22 month construction period, as per similar peaking 
plants, with the peak of HGV deliveries occurring during the first quarter 
of construction (months 1 to 3) and the peak of car and van trips 
occurring during the fifth quarter of construction (months 13 to 15). The 
car or van trips would be limited to the start and end of the working day 
whilst HGV trips would be spread across the day.  
2.11.4 
During the operational period, it is anticipated that approximately three 
people would be present on site during each shift. With three shifts per 
day, this would equate to 18 two-way car trips.   
2.12 
Timescales 
2.12.1 
Construction and commissioning of the Project will take approximately 
22 months starting in late 2018. The main works associated with the 
construction phase will be excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations, potential piling (if required) and the laying of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections, as well as construction of the Generating 
Equipment.  
2.12.2 
The Generating Equipment will be designed to have a minimum 
operational life of 25 years, and after its operational life it will be 
decommissioned or re-powered depending on the nature of the 
electricity market and energy mix at the time. For the purposes of the 
EIA, it will be assumed that the Generating Equipment will be 
decommissioned.  It does not make a material difference to the 
assessment how long the operational life is. 
2.12.3 
Decommissioning will comprise the removal of all Generating Equipment 
items and restoration of the Project Site to a similar condition compared 
to before the construction of the Project. This process will also take 
approximately 22 months. It is likely that some underground structures, 
including the Gas and Electrical Connections may be capped and left in 
situ to avoid any adverse environmental effects associated with their 
removal. Due regard will be paid to all best practice guidelines and 
legislation on decommissioning of projects which are relevant at the time

of the decommissioning activities. Where possible, items of plant will be 
recycled or reused. 
2.13 
Embedded Mitigation 
2.13.1 
Mitigation which forms part of the Project is known as embedded 
mitigation and reflects standard practice, particularly during construction.  
This section describes the measures which are considered to be 
embedded mitigation for the purposes of the preliminary assessment. 
Construction 
2.13.2 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be 
prepared to mitigate environmental effects during construction. This will 
include the following dust migitation measures: 
 
Records of dust and air quality complaints to be kept, including 
likely causes and mitigation measures to reduce effects if 
appropriate; 
 
Keep site perimeter, fences etc. clean. 
 
Consideration of weather conditions, dust generating potential 
of material to be excavated prior to commencement of works; 
 
Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles etc. 
to sensitive receptors; 
 
Dusty materials should be removed from site as soon as 
possible. 
 
Loads entering and leaving the site with dust generating 
potential should be covered and wheel washing facilities made 
available; 
 
No idling of vehicles; 
 
Vehicles to comply with site speed limits (15mph on hard 
surfaces, 10mph on unconsolidated surfaces);  
 
Water assisted sweeping of local roads to be undertaken if 
material tracked out of site; and 
 
Install hard surfacing as soon as practicable on site and ensure 
that they are maintained in good condition. 
 
Exposed soils should be revegetated as soon as practicable. 
Near residential properties or sensitive ecosystems (<50m), 
use hessian/mulches etc. where not possible to revegetate or 
cover with topsoil; 
Abergelli Power Project

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
 
Minimise dust generating activities, particularly near residential 
receptors/sensitive ecosystems during prolonged dry, dusty 
weather unless damping / other suppressants are used; 
 
Ensure an adequate water supply to site and use water as dust 
suppressant where applicable; 
 
Ensure any site machinery is well maintained and in full working 
order; 
 
Ensure equipment available for cleaning spills etc available at 
all times; and 
 
Sand and aggregates should be stored away from sensitive 
receptors and screened/shielded. Similarly concrete batching 
should take place away from receptors. 
2.13.3 
The following hydrological measures will also be included: 
 
Any surface water with the potential to be contaminated by 
hydrocarbons to be passed through oil/grit interceptors prior to 
discharge to sewer; 
 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any 
surface water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be 
allowed to enter directly or indirectly any water course, 
underground strata or adjoining land; 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use 
of lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the 
control of drainage and construction materials in order to 
prevent the contamination of ground water. Site personnel will 
be made aware of the potential impact on ground and surface 
water associated with certain aspects of the construction works 
to further reduce the likelihood of accidental effects; 
 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be 
restricted to a designated area with appropriately designed fuel 
tanks and bunds and suitable operating procedures. 
 
Siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to 
avoid pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working 
guidelines to avoid spillages near watercourses; and 
 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are 
stored will be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single 
tanks will be within bunds sized to contain 110 per cent of 
capacity and multiple tanks or drums will be within bunds sized 
to contain the greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the 
largest tank or 25 per cent of the total tanks contents.

2.13.4 
In relation to the Gas Connection, the following measures will also be 
implemented: 
 
Access roads/haul routes will be constructed to effectively 
manage drainage; 
 
Soil bunds will be placed strategically so that drainage 
catchments are not diverted or altered; 
 
Temporary wheel washing facility will be installed to prevent 
transfer of soil onto nearby public roads if necessary; 
 
If deemed necessary, temporary drainage routes/silt fences will 
be constructed (of geo-textile); 
 
Care will be taken during construction to ensure that silt laden 
water does not enter watercourses. This will be achieved by 
plugging existing drains, intercepting surface water above the 
working width and where appropriate by leaving filter strips of 
unstripped topsoil along main watercourses/ditches. Topsoil will 
be replaced over post-construction drains as soon as possible 
to prevent site water from getting into drains; 
 
Any de-watering pumping will be undertaken using an 
appropriately sized pump at such a rate to avoid disturbance or 
erosion of stream banks; 
 
De-watering pipes will be carefully positioned; and 
 
All pumps, pipes and connections used during construction will 
be regularly inspected. 
2.13.5 
Risks to construction workers during the construction phase of the 
Project will be mitigated by the correct implementation of Health and 
Safety measures, such as suitable working methods and the correct use 
of personal protective equipment (PPE).  PPE will be site-specific and 
based 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
residual 
risks 
identified from the human health risk assessment.  This may include, but 
is not limited to the use of hard hat, eye protection, appropriate gloves, 
overalls and hearing protection.  For further guidance, reference should 
be made to the Health and Safety Executive document EH40 Workplace 
Exposure Limits’54. 
2.13.6 
The ground investigation will be undertaken in line with British Standard 
BS5930: The Code of Practice for Site Investigations (BSE, October 
1999) and ISO10175: Investigation of Potentially Contaminated Sites 
(BSE, 2001). 
2.13.7 
The CEMP will include a Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP).

Operation 
2.13.8 
The embedded mitigation for the operational phase of the Project 
involves setting an appropriate stack height to allow sufficient dispersion 
of emissions prior to locations of potential exposure of human and 
ecosystem receptors and the use of sufficient emissions abatement to 
ensure emissions remain within the limits set by the IED.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This Chapter describes the scope of the EIA and structure of related ES 
for the EIA that is being undertaken to accompany the Application for a 
Development Consent Order in accordance with the EIA Regulations.  
4.1.2 
Although the sections below deal with the Project as a whole, it is 
anticipated that the ES technical chapters will be sub-divided allowing 
the assessment of effects during the construction, operation and 
decommissioning phases, description of mitigation measures and 
residual effects to be addressed separately for the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connections as well as together for 
the overall Project. 
4.1.3 
In accordance with the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA 
process for the Project has included the following: 
 
Establishing, through consultation, the scope of the EIA 
including obtaining a Scoping Opinion from the SoS; 
 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives; 
 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the Project Site and the 
relevant study areas for each topic; 
 
Identifying the potential environmental effects resulting from the 
Project; 
 
Determining how the potential environmental effects can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and/or 
further mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
 
Assessing the significance of the potential environmental 
effects in conjunction with other effects arising from the Project 
and those from other reasonably foreseeable neighbouring 
developments and/or sources (cumulative effects); and 
 
Proposing options as to how any significant adverse residual 
effects will be mitigated, managed and monitored.  
4.2 
Screening 
4.2.1 
No formal Screening Opinion has been sought from PINS as the Project 
falls within Schedule 2 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
30 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 200925 and has the potential to result 
in significant environmental effects. 
4.3 
Scoping 
4.3.1 
APL requested a Scoping Opinion from PINS in July 2014. The request 
was supported by a Scoping Report that described the anticipated 
significant environmental issues that will require detailed evaluation as 
part of the EIA process. The formal Scoping Opinion was received in 
August 2014. It has allowed for agreement on the potential likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project and, therefore, the 
aspects of the environment on which the EIA should focus. 
4.3.2 
The Scoping Report26 and Opinion27 can be found on the Planning 
Inspectorate’s website and APL’s website.  The Applicant’s responses to 
the matters raised in the Scoping Opinion are set out in Appendix 4.1. 
4.3.3 
The site that was considered in the Scoping Report is shown in Figure 
1.2. 
4.3.4 
Further consultation with those bodies that commented on the Scoping 
Report was also carried out in August and September 2014 including: 
 Natural Resources Wales; 
 South and West Wales Wildlife Trust; 
 Abertawe Bro Morgannwy; 
 Civil Aviation Authority;  
 Ministry of Defence; 
 CADW; 
 Brecon Beacons National Park Authority; 
 City and County of Swansea Council; 
 Network Rail; and 
 The Coal Authority. 
4.4 
Scope of the Preliminary Assessment 
4.4.1 
The PEIR sets out the findings of the preliminary assessment of the 
Project as explained in Section 1.2.  Each topic chapter describes what

assessment work been undertaken in the PEIR and what further work 
will be undertaken to prepare the ES. 
4.4.2 
To allow for a precautionary approach, the assessments in this PEIR are 
based on a realistic worst case scenario specific to each topic based on 
the Rochdale Envelope parameters as described in Chapter 2. 
4.4.3 
The ES will be accompanied by a ‘No Significant Effects Report’ subject 
to consultation with Natural Resources Wales (NRW).  This is a 
requirement of Regulation 5(2)(l) of the Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2009 and 
assesses all effects on nature conservation and geological features. 
4.5 
Environmental Baseline 
4.5.1 
In undertaking an EIA for any project it is important to identify the 
environmental baseline for the potential receptors which may be affected 
by the Project in respect of, for example, noise, ecology, air quality. In 
the preliminary assessment, this has allowed the effects of the Project to 
be compared and/or combined with the existing quality of the 
environment in order to ensure an informed assessment of the potential 
effects and to allow the identification of the most appropriate mitigation 
which could be employed to minimise any adverse effects. 
4.5.2 
To establish the baseline, a study area that is appropriate for each 
assessment topic has been identified. Next, a range of environmental 
data has been gathered from a combination of sources in respect of the 
study area in order to inform the preliminary assessment. This has 
included: 
 
Documentary information on the Power Generation Plant Site, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection routes, and their 
surroundings within each relevant study area, including 
information available from the previous environmental impact 
assessment work for other projects; 
 
Field survey information, including: Phase 2 ecological surveys; 
landscape character assessments; background noise levels; 
ground conditions/contaminated land assessments, location of 
sensitive receptors and traffic levels on the road network; and 
 
Data held by both statutory and non-statutory consultees. 
4.6 
Assessment Methodology 
4.6.1 
The significance of environmental effects resulting from the construction, 
operation (including all maintenance activities) and decommissioning of 
the Project has been categorised using a series of matrices. These have 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
32 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
been developed in each topic chapter to describe the sensitivity of 
receptors and resources which have the potential to be impacted by the 
Project and the magnitude of any impacts that are likely to arise. The 
sensitivity of receptors and resources and magnitude of impact have 
been cross-referenced to give an overall assessment of the effects for 
any potential impact. Where it is not possible to quantify impacts, 
qualitative assessments have been carried out, based on available 
knowledge and professional judgement.  These will be further developed 
in the ES. 
4.6.2 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of 
effects upon different environmental components, the assessments 
generally follow the structure and use the terminology outlined below in 
Tables 4.1 to 4.3. However, for some sections, significance criteria may 
differ depending on the assessment methodology used. Each technical 
chapter in the PEIR clearly identifies and explains any specific criteria 
used as well as defining what constitutes a significant impact and/or 
effect.

Unless otherwise stated, effects of moderate significance or above are 
considered to be ‘Significant’ for the purposes of the EIA Regulations. 
4.7 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
4.7.1 
Full consideration has been given to the potential mitigation measures 
which could be used to ensure that any potentially significant adverse 
environmental effect of the Project is minimised. 
4.7.2 
In the hierarchy of mitigation, likely significant adverse effects should, in 
the first instance, be avoided altogether; where this is not possible such 
effects should then reduce and, finally, off-set. 
4.7.3 
Potential mitigation measures described in the PEIR include embedded 
mitigation through design/standard control measures (which will be used 
to produce an initial assessment of impact) and any further specific 
mitigation required (which will be taken into account to produce an

assessment of residual effects).  Embedded mitigation is described in 
Section 2.13. 
4.8 
Indirect/Secondary Effects, Impact Interactions and Cumulative 
Effects 
4.8.1 
Indirect and secondary effects are those which arise as a result of a 
direct/primary effect. For example, deterioration of water quality in a 
watercourse due to an effluent discharge (which will be a direct effect) 
could have an indirect/secondary effect on aquatic biodiversity. These 
are considered as an inherent part of the assessment in each topic 
chapter. 
4.8.2 
The interrelationships between impacts will be considered in the ES. 
4.8.3 
Cumulative effects occur when a receptor is subject to multiple impacts 
from multiple schemes. Cumulative and indirect/secondary effects are 
discussed in each topic chapter of this PEIR. 
4.8.4 
Developments considered within the cumulative assessment include 
those that are:  
 
In the process of being built; 
 
Permitted application(s) but not yet implemented; 
 
Submitted application(s) not yet determined; 
 
Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects; 
 
Projects identified in the relevant development plan (and 
emerging development plants – with appropriate weight being 
given as they move closer to adoption) recognising that 
information on the relevant proposals will be limited; and  
 
Projects identified in other plans and programmes (as 
appropriate) which set the framework for future development 
consent 
orders/approvals, 
where 
such 
development 
is 
reasonably likely to come forward. 
4.8.5 
At present, it is anticipated that the following developments will be 
considered as part of the cumulative assessment (see Figure 4.1).   
 
Planning Application 2013/1221 – Installation of 16 wind 
turbines (maximum height to blade tip of 127 metres with a hub 
height of 80 metres), with a maximum generating capacity of 
48MW, associated tracks and ancillary infrastructure at Mynydd 
y Gwair;

 
Planning Application 2013/0795 – Installation of four 5 kW wind 
turbines 120.7 m to tip and associated infrastructure at Myle 
Coch Mawr;  
 
Planning Application 2013/0135 – Installation of ground 
mounted array of solar panels, inverter substations and 2.4 m

be located east of the Gas Connection; 
 
Planning Application 2013/1639 (Rhyd-y-pandy Solar Park) – 
Construction of 7 MW solar park consisting of installation of up 
to 28,250 photovoltaic panels and up to six inverter/transformer 
cabins, a single control building and provision of security 
fencing; 
 
Planning Application 2013/1835 (Felindre Business Park) – 
Construction of park and ride/share car park (approximately 
480 spaces) with new vehicular access, security office, toilet, 
engineering and associated works, including lighting, fencing, 
drainage attenuation and landscaping; and  
 
Planning Application 2014/1022 (Brynwhilach Solar Park) – 
Construction of 12.69MW solar park consisting of installation of 
up to 47,000 pv panels and 8 inverter/transformer stations, 2 
substations, storage container, new access tracks, security 
fencing/cctv and associated equipment and infrastructure work. 
4.8.6 
Further to these individual planning applications, proposed development 
within the Swansea Vale Development Area will also be considered for 
assessment of any significant cumulative effects. Swansea Vale is 
situated approximately 5 km from the Project Site and extends to some 
190 ha south of a railway line and the M4.  
4.8.7 
In addition, during the EIA other developments may be identified if more 
information becomes publicly available and if so the above list will be 
updated. 
4.9 
Project Scenario for Assessment (the "Rochdale Envelope") 
4.9.1 
There are several configuration options of SCGT plant available to 
generate up to 299 MW at the Project Site. These different options mainly 
relate to the number of gas turbine generator units used at the 
Generating Equipment Site. Each gas turbine generator unit consists of 
one or two gas turbines venting to a single stack. The Application will be 
flexible enough to allow APL to achieve a 299 MW Project by building 
between one to five gas turbine generator units.  
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
36 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
4.9.2 
The other integral supporting infrastructure at the Generating Equipment 
Site including water tanks, administration building, stores, electricity 
banking compound, GRF and gatehouse will remain constant, no matter 
how many gas turbine generator units are used.  
4.9.3 
Additionally, the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection route 
corridor options will also remain the same.  Only one route option for the 
Gas connection and the Electrical Connection is considered in this PEIR.  
4.9.4 
Air quality sensitivity tests (Appendix 6.1) have indicated that a minimum 
stack height of 35 m will be required for adequate dispersion of exhaust 
gases and to meet legislative air quality targets (i.e. IED). This takes into 
consideration potential differences in technology choices available from 
different Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), the requirement to 
fit constant emissions monitors (CEMS) and silencers into the stack. This 
height applies to all technology choices and is not dependent on the 
number of units present at the Generating Equipment Site. Therefore if 
one gas turbine generator is used, one stack of 35 m will be required and 
if five gas turbine generators are used, five stacks of 35 m each will be 
required.  A maximum height of 40 m has been assumed for the purpose 
of the Landscape and Visual Impact and Cultural Heritage Assessments 
as a ‘realistic worst-case’ scenario. 
4.9.5 
In accordance with PINS Advice Note 928 (Rochdale Envelope), rather 
than assess every possible iteration for the Project, the assessments 
presented in the PEIR (and the ES when it is prepared) are based on an 
assessment of the realistic 'worst case' scenario from within the Project 
parameters.  This allows flexibility for the Applicant whilst ensuring that 
the likely significant environmental effects are identified. 
4.9.6 
Taking the above into consideration, it has been determined that for all 
topic areas to be addressed in the EIA apart from socio-economics, a 
realistic ‘worst case’ scenario from the perspective of environmental 
effects will be five gas turbine generator units. In addition, for all topic 
areas except air quality, the highest stack height (40 m) represents the 
'worst case'. For air quality the lowest stacks (35 m) represent the 'worst 
case' due to lower dispertion but, in addition to the lowest stack height, 
the highest stack height will be assessed in the air quality chapter of the 
ES so that the EIA contains a complete assessment of the realistic worst 
case scenario. The ES will contain an explanation in each chapter of why 
the scenario assessed represents the worst case for that topic.  
4.9.7 
For the preliminary assessment, it has been assumed that the Power 
Generation Plant will operate for 1500 hours per year in the noise and

air quality assessments.  In the noise assessment, it is assumed that the 
Power Generation Plant will operate at night to represent the worst case 
scenario.  Where there is the possibility that intermittent operation could 
give rise to more significant effects than continuous operation (for 
example start-up noise) this been considered in the noise and air quality 
assessments.  This issue is not relevant to any other topic chapters. 
4.10 
Transboundary Effects 
4.10.1 
Due to the nature and location of the Project, it is considered that there 
will be no effects caused by the Project that will affect any other EU State.  
A Transboundary Screening assessment has been undertaken by the 
Examining Authority which confirms this approach29. 
4.10.2 
The only activity that may result in any effect in another State is if 
construction materials are sourced outside the United Kingdom.  
However, effects at the point of extraction of minerals or point of 
manufacture and transport of materials used in the Project will be 
considered in the EIA for that development and are therefore scoped out 
of this EIA and are not considered further.

ALTERNATIVES 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This Chapter describes the alternative sites and technologies considered 
for the Project so far. 
5.2 
Alternative Project Sites 
5.2.1 
The choice of site for the Power Generation Plant has been carefully 
considered with various sites investigated throughout the country and a 
number of relevant factors looked at during this process in accordance 
with paragraph 4.4.1 of the NPS EN-1 and NPS EN-2. Key factors 
included in the selection of the Power Generation Plant Site are:  
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Electrical Connection point; 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Gas Connection point; 
 
It is in a developed setting dominated by the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and National Grid’s Swansea North 
substation; and 
 
It has a well-developed road network and access to the Project 
Site. 
5.3 
Project Site Boundary 
5.3.1 
Figure 1.2, which was originally in the Scoping Report submitted to PINS 
in July 2014, shows an ‘opportunity area’ for the Gas and Electrical 
Connections.  Following design refinement, one route option has now 
been identified for each of these connections as explained below in 
Section 5.6 and 5.7. 
5.3.2 
The Project Site boundary outlined in red on Figure 1.1 has therefore 
been reduced in size to take account of the decision taken on these route 
options.  The Applicant has also sought to avoid areas which have been 
identified as being environmentally sensitive as a result of ongoing 
ecological surveys, such as an area of woodland to the north east of the 
Power Generation Plant Site and the area of Rhos pasture to the north 
west. 
5.4 
Power Generation Plant 
5.4.1 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment will operate for up to 1,500 
hours per year as decribed in Section 1.1.  
5.4.2 
Given these parameters, it has been determined that a SCGT plant is 
the preferred and most appropriate technology choice for the Project. 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report

5.4.3 
There are several alternative types of SCGT plant available to generate 
up to 299 MW. SCGT plants often use aero-derivative gas turbines (i.e. 
turbines derived from aeronautical applications), primarily because of 
their suitability for frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-
availability maintenance techniques. For the aero-derivative case, APL 
envisages using three, four or five individual aero-derivative turbine 
generators to achieve 299 MW.   
5.4.4 
However, ‘industrial’ type gas turbines can also be used which are 
typically larger and often more suited to longer operational hours. They 
offer similar efficiency but less fast loading flexibility. Industrial gas 
turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the casings, rotors and 
blading are of heavier construction. For the industrial gas turbine case, it 
is anticipated that one or two individual industrial gas turbine generators 
will be used to achieve 299 MW. 
5.4.5 
A stack height sensitivity study (Appendix 6.2) has been undertaken for 
the Project to determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine 
Generators, required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet 
legislative air quality targets. This height will apply to all technology 
choices, as discussed above, and will not be dependent on the number 
of units present at the Generating Equipment Site.  A maximum height 
of 40 m has also been applied as the realistic worst case scenario. 
5.4.6 
The Application will therefore be flexible enough using the Rochdale 
Envelope approach to allow APL to achieve a 299 MW Project by 
building between one to five Gas Turbine Generators, with up to five 
exhaust gas flue stacks. 
5.4.7 
In terms of design evolution of the Project, the following technology 
options were originally considered for the 299 MW Power Generation 
Plant: SCGT plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; and 
Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant. 
5.4.8 
A SCGT is an internal combustion engine which converts heat into work 
using gases as a working medium. Air is compressed in a multi-stage 
bladed compressor, liquid oil or gas fuel is added and burnt in 
combustors and the resulting very hot gases are expanded through 
stages of turbine blades to drive both the compressor and a generator. 
The exhaust gases are discharged to atmosphere. Gas turbines 
are similar in technology to aircraft jet engines. 
5.4.9 
CCGT describes the addition of a steam turbine to the gas turbine cycle 
such that the hot exhaust gases are passed through a Heat Recovery 
Steam Generator (‘HRSG’ or ‘boiler’) to convert pure water to high 
pressure steam which is used to drive a steam turbine generator. This 
cycle can produce around 50% more electricity with no additional fuel.

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
5.4.10 
SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for the 
Project based on the following environmental, technical and feasibility 
considerations:  
 
Visual impact: SCGT plant require shorter stack(s) compared to 
CCGT plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views 
from the surrounding environment; 
 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is 
significantly lower than for a CCGT plant; 
 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant will 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of 
RGE units will be required at the Generating Equipment Site to 
generate up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible and 
the noise levels will overall be lower; 
 
Financial: based on the current electricity market, it is essential 
that the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed is cost 
effective and competitive, as it will be called upon to operate 
flexibly to balance out the National Grid and meet changing 
demands of customers. SCGT plants are better suited to this 
type of operational regime; and  
 
Start-up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down 
much quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, 
therefore, better suited to meeting variable demands.   
5.4.11 
The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was 
also considered. However it is not technically or economically feasible 
with a peaking power station because the profile for the generation of 
electrical energy from the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with 
the required heat demand profile of any potential customer.   
5.5 
Access Road 
5.5.1 
There are two options for road access which are being consulted upon 
at this stage which are described in Section 2.11. 
5.5.2 
Option 1 for the access road is from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road 
and the existing access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm 
which will need to be extended to the Generating Equipment Site, as 
shown on Figure 1.2.  The development of this option would involve 
widening of the existing track to 6 m and localised upgrades along the 
existing road network (see Figure 2.1 to 2.4).  The track crosses the NTS 
Pipeline (Feeder 28).  It runs parallel to a water pipeline but does not 
cross it.

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
5.5.3 
Option 2 is from the west via the B4489, along the access road to 
National Grid’s two electrical substations and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station and then along a purpose built Access Road to be constructed, 
across undeveloped land to the Generating Equipment Site as shown on 
Figure 1.2.  A new track will be constructed along part of the route (see 
Figure 2.1).  The track will cross a 400kv cable, two watercourses and 
an LTS pipeline. 
5.6 
Electrical Connection 
5.6.1 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Project Site in 
March 2014 in order to define and evaluate the options available for 
connecting the Generating Equipment to the NETS. The most suitable 
point of connection is currently anticipated to be a cable terminal 
chamber on the Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) circuit at the point where 
the underground cable emerges to facilitate its connection into the 
NETS. 
5.6.2 
Both underground cables and overhead lines were considered.  
Underground cables were identified as the preferred option due to the 
limited visual impact.  This also takes into account the cumulative effect 
of adding more overhead lines to an area that already includes several 
overhead lines. 
5.6.3 
Due to proximity of the site to the North Swansea 400 kV substation it is 
assumed the connection will be to that substation. 
5.6.4 
The Electrical Connection Opportunity Area (see Figure 2.1), to the south 
west of the Generating Equipment Site, is the area within which the route 
for the Electrical Connection has been identified.  In July 2014, the 
chosen route (as described in Section 2.7) was identified during a site 
walkover of the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area. A limited number 
of route corridor options for the Electrical Connection were considered, 
as the most appropriate option i.e. the shortest, most direct route from 
the Generating Equipment Site to the substation, requiring the least 
amount of land take and avoiding any statutory designated sites or 
valued habitats, was available (see Figure 5.1). This negated the need 
to assess any less favourable options. 
5.6.5 
The suitability of the ground conditions for proposed route and the 
location of utilities will need to be confirmed through site investigation. 
5.6.6 
If Access Option 1 is chosen as the preferred access option, the 
Electrical Connection will be installed below the road in order to reduce 
the amount of land required.

5.7 
Gas Connection 
5.7.1 
A Gas Connection Feasibility Study was undertaken in March 2014 to 
define and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating 
Equipment to a suitable source of fuel gas. This identified Feeder 28 of 
the NTS or a nearby LTS HP Pipeline as possible connection points. The 
location of these in relation to the Project Site is shown on Figure 5.1.   
5.7.2 
Investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the NTS or LTS 
HP Pipelines were carried out. The Gas Connection will be situated 
within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area which extends north and 
south from the Generating Equipment Site as shown on Figure 1.2.   
5.7.3 
Four connection options (shown on Figure 5.2) listed below were 
explored and further refined to a single Gas Connection route during the 
investigations. All routes lead from the AGI at the northern Project Site 
Boundary, across fields to link to the Generating Equipment Site.  Due 
regard has been paid to relevant factors including environmental, 
planning, safety, engineering and constructability in selecting the 
preferred route.  
 
Option 1 was approximately 1.7 km in length including no major 
road crossings, four minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and two minor water crossings.  This Option was a 
feasible route option although it presented some major risks in 
regards to the impacts on protected species and their habitats 
and proximity to the development of two Solar Farms. 
 
Option 2 was approximately 1.2 km in length including no major 
road crossings, one minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and one minor water crossing. This Option was 
preferred as it represented the shortest distance avoiding 
habitats which have been identified as favourable for protected 
species and the risks associated to crossings of major gas 
assets.  Although this route was not favoured due to the 
perceived simplicity of the LTS option, it is the better of the NTS 
options available.  A major risk remains in the possibility of 
routeing either through the proposed solar farm or alongside 
and parallel to Feeder 28. 
 
Option 3 was approximately 1.4 km in length including no major 
road crossings, one minor road crossing, no major water 
crossings and three minor water crossings. Option 3 was 
considered the most viable alternative to Option 2.  The route 
must cross Feeder 28 and must allow for an HDD crossing 
technique.

 
Option 4 was approximately 0.4 km in length including no major 
road crossings, no minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and one minor water crossing. Option 4 is the LTS 
option.  The route is relatively simple with one minor crossing, 
though this comes at the cost of allowing little buffer capacity and 
will require negotiation with Wales and West Utilities in regards to 
their availability of fuel gas capacity. 
5.7.4 
Option 3 was the chosen Gas Connection.  Although it was not the 
shortest route, it had lower risks than Option 2 that were associated with 
routing the Gas Connection between the solar farm to the north and 
Feeder 28.  It also avoided habitats which were identified as having the 
potential for protect species during the Phase One Habitat Survey (see 
Chapter 8). 
5.7.5 
Details of the studies and related assessment undertaken will be 
provided in the ES that will accompany the Application.

AIR QUALITY 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
This chapter provides the air quality preliminary environmental 
assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power Project based upon 
assessment carried out up to end of September 2014.  The Project is set 
out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for the assessment 
carried out to date.   
6.1.2 
The following factors have specifically been taken account of in this 
preliminary assessment.  The project assessment scenario is based on 
the possible worst case land take to accommodate the Project Site, and 
a mimimum stack height of 35 m which presents a worst case scenario 
from an air quality point of view.  The assessment has considered 
potentially significant effects which may be caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project on noise sensitive 
receptors in and around the vicinity of the Project Site. 
6.1.3 
Embedded mitigation in relation to ecology consists of the production of 
a CEMP (see Section 2.13).  Monitoring will ensure the measures are 
effective.

Assessment Methodology 
6.2.2 
The section sets out the assessment methodology and all preliminary 
investigations carried out to inform this PEIR have followed this 
methodology.  Discussions with the Environmental Health Officers 
(EHO) at CCS and NRW are on going to agree the final assessment 
methodology for the ES. 
Study Area 
6.2.3 
In relation to construction and decommissioning impacts, whilst small 
particles (<10 μm) can travel distances in excess of 1 km, the majority of 
large dust particles generated by construction activities (greater than 30 
μm) are deposited within 100 m of sources, and intermediate sized 
particles (10-30 μm) are likely to travel up to 200-500 m.  However, as 
the particles are transported downwind, their concentration reduces 
rapidly due to the action of atmospheric dispersion.   
6.2.4 
Following the IAQM guidance on the assessment of construction dust, 
impacts on human receptors are only considered within 350 m of 
potential dust sources and ecological receptors are only considered 
within 100 m of activities.  The potential dust sources include: areas of 
specific construction activities; the route of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection; and all public and private roads within 500 m of the Project 
Site. Outside of this study area, it is reasonable to conclude that 
construction impacts will be negligible.

6.2.5 
In relation to operational impacts, the study area extends 10 km in all 
directions from the Generating Equipment Site for both ecological and 
human receptors.  This distance conforms to the EA guidelines (H1 – 
Annex F) on the assessment of impacts. There are no operational 
impacts on local air quality anticipated from the Gas and Electrical 
Connections. 
Sources of Baseline Data 
6.2.6 
Baseline air quality in the study area has been assessed with reference 
to the reports prepared by CCS under the requirements of the Local Air 
Quality Management regime and the mapped data provided by Defra 
and APIS. 
6.2.7 
Project specific monitoring has not been undertaken since the existing 
data holdings are sufficient to characterise current air quality in the study 
area, as demonstrated in the following sections. 
Construction Assessment 
6.2.8 
The IAQM guidance on the assessment of construction impacts provides 
distance based criteria for qualitatively assessing dust/particulate matter 
impacts from construction activities. The assessment criteria consider 
the scale and nature of the works, classed as small, medium or large, as 
well as the proximity of the receptors.  The potential for dust emissions 
from four different types of activity are assessed, namely: 
 
Demolition (which is not applicable to this Project); 
 
Earthworks; 
 
Construction; and 
 
Trackout (the movement of dust/mud offsite on haulage vehicles 
wheels and bodies onto the public road network where it may be 
resuspended by other vehicles). 
6.2.9 
The assessment has four stages: 
 
Determination of the magnitude of potential dust generating 
activities of the Project (termed dust emissions class);  
 
Determination of the sensitivity of receptors - identification of 
sensitive land uses, the proximity and number of receptors, 
background PM10 concentrations and site specific factors; 
 
Assessment of the risk of effects in the absence of mitigation; and 
 
Assessment of the significance of the effects following mitigation.

6.2.10 
The assessment uses a matrix based approach and the significance of 
construction dust effects is assessed in accordance with IAQM guidance.  
This explains how the aim for all construction activity should be to 
prevent significant effects on receptors through the use of effective 
mitigation. The assessment of the significance of effects, in accordance 
with IAQM guidance, therefore assumes the principle of mitigation being 
in place at all times, as would be the case on properly managed 
construction sites. 
6.2.11 
The guidance considers that the implementation of effective on-site 
mitigation will be sufficient to ensure that effects are not significant. 
Nonetheless, it is important to consider specific characteristics of the 
Project Site and the surrounding area to ensure a robust assessment of 
dust impacts in relation to this conclusion. 
6.2.12 
For the PEIR report, a high level assessment of risks and potential 
impacts has been undertaken which essentially draws on the 
conclusions of the IAQM guidance that mitigation (the Dust Management 
Plan) will be in place and will prevent significant effects.  For the ES, and 
following the IAQM guidance, a receptor oriented assessment is 
currently being undertaken and will consider in greater detail three 
separate potential effects arising from the emissions of dust and 
particulate matter, namely: 
 
Annoyance/loss of amenity due to dust soiling;  
 
The risk to health due to an increase in exposure to PM10; and 
 
The risk to ecological receptors due to an increase in exposure to 
dust. 
Operational Assessment 
6.2.13 
The air quality assessment for the operational phase follows the EA 
documents ‘Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f): Air Emissions’31 
and the EA Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (AQMAU) ‘Air 
dispersion modelling report requirements (for detailed air dispersion 
modelling)’32. The conversion of NOx to NO2, as applicable for the 
protection of human health under the UK Air Quality Standards 
Regulations 201033, adopts the approach outlined in the AQMAU 
Guidance Note ‘Conversion Ratios for NOX and NO2’ (2006)34.  
6.2.14 
As a peaking plant, the operation of the Generating Equipment will be 
limited through the permitting regime to 1,500 hours per annum. The

assessment is, therefore, based on the operation of the Generating 
Equipment, at full load, for 1,500 hours per annum.   For the purposes of 
the air quality assessment this intermittent operation is assessed by 
assuming full load, continuous operation (to ensure worst case 
meteorological impacts are included in the model) and scaling the 
outputs for periods longer than one hour by likely operating hours i.e. 
1500 out of a possible 8760 hours for annual mean impacts.  No scaling 
is applied to hourly impacts to ensure a conservative approach, since it 
is possible that the operation of the Generating Equipment will coincide 
with poor dispersion conditions. 
6.2.15 
Atmospheric dispersion modelling has been carried out using the 
Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC) Air Dispersion 
Modelling Software (ADMS 5.0). An air dispersion model has been set 
up that considers the effects of terrain and buildings (as appropriate to 
the location of the Generating Equipment), together with the most recent 
available meteorological data covering a consecutive five year period 
(e.g. 2009 to 2013, inclusive) in accordance with current guidance.  This 
model will be refined during the preparation of the ES as further, more 
detailed, 
information 
becomes 
available 
including 
updated 
meteorological data. 
6.2.16 
The modelling assessment estimates the mass concentration of NOx and 
CO at sensitive receptors using the emission limits as specified in Part 2 
of Annex V to the IED. Initial screening runs have been undertaken to 
determine an acceptable stack height suitable for adequate dispersion 
based on predicted maximum short term and long term ground level 
concentrations. The sensitivity tests are presented in Appendix 6.1.  
Detailed atmospheric dispersion modelling will be undertaken for the ES 
on the basis of the selected stack height.  
6.2.17 
The results of the detailed dispersion modelling are compared with 
background levels and relevant standards and guidelines (i.e. the Air 
Quality Standards Regulations 2010). Direct comparison is made 
between the long-term and short-term process contributions from the 
Generating Equipment, the predicted environmental concentrations of 
relevant substances (i.e. process contribution plus background levels) 
and the limits and objectives within the relevant Air Quality Standards 
Regulations 2010.  For the ES, model outputs will also be presented as 
isopleths. 
6.2.18 
The abatement of emissions is discussed in relation to application of Best 
Available Techniques (BAT), in accordance with the EA Sector Guidance 
Note for Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01)35 and the UK’s position with 
regards to the on-going review of the EU IPPC Reference Document on

BAT for Large Combustion Plants36. Should additional mitigation prove 
to be necessary, the severity of impact, frequency of emissions and the 
resultant environmental risk associated with any residual impact will be 
examined in the ES.   
6.2.19 
Changes in air quality levels for NOx are assessed with respect to 
ecology for European, nationally and locally designated habitat sites. An 
initial assessment of the increased deposition of both nutrient nitrogen 
and acid due to nitrogen has been carried out in accordance with the 
methodologies described in the EA AQMAU ‘AQTAG06 Technical 
Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate assessment 
for emissions to air’37.  This modelling is being refined for the ES. 
6.2.20 
It is considered that there will not be any noticeable odours associated 
with the operation of the Generating Equipment at or beyond the 
boundary of the Generating Equipment Site and therefore it is not 
considered necessary to undertake a detailed assessment of odour.   
Assessment Criteria 
6.2.21 
In relation to ambient pollutant concentration, the criteria used for the 
assessment of operational impacts are the air quality objectives and limit 
values set out in Welsh air quality regulation (paragraph 6.2.1). For 
deposition, no comparable regulated standards exist and the impacts are 
assessed against critical loads.  Critical loads are set for effects due to 
eutrophication (nitrogen deposition) and acidification (combined action 
of sulphur and nitrogen deposition).  It is reiterated that the critical loads 
are set at levels below which significant harmful effects do not occur. 
6.2.22 
Critical loads are assigned to habitat classes of the European Nature 
Information System (EUNIS) to enable consistency of habitat 
terminology and understanding across Europe.  They are given as 
ranges (e.g. 10-20 kgN/ha/yr) which reflect variations in ecosystem 
response and soil types across Europe.  In the assessment, a 
conservative approach will be adopted and impacts will be compared to 
the lower limit of the specified range. 
6.2.23 
For acidification, the critical loads are specified through the definition of 
a critical load function (CLF) which identifies the combinations of sulphur 
and nitrogen deposition that will not cause harmful effects.  In the CLF, 
sulphur deposition is plotted against nitrogen deposition (shown below), 
and the risk of acidification impacts is characterised by the three 
following quantities:

6.2.25 
The critical loads for the assessment have been taken from the APIS 
website, using the facility to extract site-specific relevant critical loads38. 
For any local designated sites, critical loads have been extracted using 
the search by location tool and the designated feature for the site. These 
assessment standards will apply to both work undertaken for the PEIR 
and the ES. 
Carbon Dioxide Emissions 
6.2.26 
The Generating Equipment is proposed to be permitted to operate up to 
1,500 hours per annum (actual operational times are likely to be lower, 
typically 500 hours per annum of operation in 2 – 3 hour tranches) and 
would emit approximately 0.22 Mt CO2 per annum, which equates to 
0.13% of UK emissions of CO2 from power stations used for public 
energy supply in 2012 (192.9 Mt CO239), assuming full load operation as 
a worst case. The Generating Equipment will utilise natural gas, 
considered to have lower carbon content than other fossil fuels. 
According to the 2014 Defra emission factors, natural gas emits 0.184

kg CO2 per kW hours, whereas burning diesel would emit 0.246kg CO2 
per kW hours. The use of diesel will increase CO2 emissions to 0.30 Mt. 
Therefore, with technology presently in use in the UK, a gas fuelled plant 
provides the most carbon efficient means of electricity production from 
fossil fuels.    
6.2.27 
The Generating Equipment is designed to provide electricity during peak 
times and potentially supplement power generation when other low 
carbon technologies such as wind are unable to satisfy energy demands. 
According to the UK’s National Policy Statement on Energy (Section 5.2 
of NPS EN-1), maintaining fossil fuel power stations are vital as they can 
ensure reliable electricity supply and provide diversity in the UK’s energy 
mix.  As such, the Project is aligned with the UK climate change goals 
as it is a tool in the transition to a low carbon economy.  
6.2.28 
The UK’s National Policy Statement (paragraph 5.2.2 of NPS EN-1) also 
states that the “Government has determined that CO2 emissions are not 
reasons to prohibit the consenting of projects” and that the “IPC does 
not, therefore, need to assess individual applications in terms of carbon 
emissions against carbon budgets and this section [NPS EN-1, Section 
5.2 Air quality and emissions] does not address CO2 emissions”. The 
proposal’s carbon emissions are considered marginal and therefore, 
considering current policy, impacts on climate change from CO2 
emissions are not considered significant. 
Significance Criteria 
6.2.29 
Table 6.1 shows the significance criteria set by EPUK for assessing local 
air quality impacts.  The significance of any effect is determined by both 
the magnitude of the change in concentration resulting from the Project 
and the total ambient pollution concentration with the Project in 
operation.  The latter criteria can be considered as a proxy for the 
sensitivity of the receiving environment as used in the generic 
significance assessment methodology set out in Section 4 of this PEIR 
i.e. where pollutant concentrations exceed the air quality objective with 
the Project in operation, the receptors can be considered to have very 
high sensitivity to air quality impacts, conversely, where pollutant 
concentrations are well below the objective, the receptors have low 
sensitivity to impacts. 
6.2.30 
Table 6.2 shows that the significance of an impact increases as the total 
pollution level increases. 
6.2.31 
The EPUK criteria apply directly to the assessment of impacts against 
air quality objectives.  For the assessment, their applicability has been 
extended to the assessment of impacts on ecosystems from the 
deposition of nitrogen against critical loads.

6.2.32 
In setting an appropriate stack height for the Generating Equipment, it 
was considered that: 
 
The significance of the effect should be negligible everywhere; 
 
The impact of the operation of the Generating Equipment should be 
imperceptible in magnitude where concentrations/deposition levels 
exceed or are at significant risk of exceeding an air quality objective 
or critical load; and 
 
Where there is a low risk of exceedence of an air quality objective 
or critical load, the magnitude of the ground level impact should be 
medium or less (<10% of any standard) everywhere or else total 
pollutant concentrations should be well below any assessment 
standard.  
6.2.33 
That is to say, any effect should lie within the area shaded in green in 
Table 6.1 and considered not significant in EIA terms for air quality. 
6.2.34 
This approach is consistent with EA guidance (H1 Annex f) on screening 
of significant effects which states that the process contributions can be 
considered insignificant if the long term process contribution is <1% of 
the long term environmental standard.  The guidance further states that 
the 1% threshold is based on the judgement that it is unlikely that an 
emission at this level will make a significance contribution to air quality 
since process contributions will be small in comparison to background 
levels, even if a standard is exceeded. 
Limitations  
6.2.35 
This assessment has the following limitations and assumptions:

The background concentrations considered in the assessment will 
be based on existing data sources as no site specific monitoring 
will be undertaken.  These data are, however, considered to

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Local Air Quality Management 
6.3.2 
In its 2013 Progress Report40, CCS stated that exceedences of the 
annual NO2 objective have been recorded in a number of locations, 
primarily within the City of Swansea. It included the areas of Hafod, 
Sketty and Fforestfach that form part of the existing Air Quality 
Management Area (AQMA) declared for traffic related NO2. Further 
exceedences have been recorded at the areas of Uplands, Mumbles and 
St Thomas. CCS is considering extending the AQMA to include Uplands 
and will undertake further monitoring at Mumbles and the City Centre.  
6.3.3 
The CCS AQMA is located 4.5 km south of the Project Site. 
Concentrations of air pollutants at the Project Site are expected to be 
well within the relevant air quality objectives.   
6.3.4 
There are a number of continuous monitoring stations in CCS. A 
summary of the monitoring data for the most relevant automatic 
monitoring stations is presented in Table 6.2.  
6.3.5 
The monitoring data from the roadside stations (Swansea AURN and 
Morriston Groundhog) show widespread compliance with the annual 
NO2 objective of 40 µg/m3. Recorded concentrations at the Cwm Level 
Park urban background station are slightly lower than the roadside 
stations in 2011 and 2012 and range from 19.6 to 23.4 µg/m3. 
6.3.6 
Concentrations of particulate matter at the two roadside monitoring 
stations show widespread compliance with the annual objective 
of 40 µg/m3.

CCS operates a network of NO2 diffusion tubes focused on roadside 
locations mainly at busy junctions and narrow and congested roads. The 
Project Site is at a rural location and therefore monitoring data from the 
NO2 diffusion tube network are not considered relevant to inform air 
quality baseline at the Project Site. NO2 concentration recorded by 
diffusion tube network, range from 21.8 – 55.5 µg/m3 with the AQMA and 
12.7 – 48.8 µg/m3 outside the AQMA in 2012. The closet diffusion tube 
locations are at Cwmrhydyceirw and Clydach, 2 km south and 3 km east 
of the Project Site respectively. Concentrations at Clydach ranged from 
29.2 – 34.7 µg/m3 in 2012. Concentrations at Cwmrhydyceirw ranged 
from 22.6 – 33.1 µg/m3 in 2012. 
6.3.8 
In summary, NO2 and particulate matter concentrations across the 
operational study area are generally very low, both in rural and suburban 
areas.  At the roadside, outside of urban areas, concentrations are higher 
but likely to be well within the air quality objectives.  In larger urban areas 
(Swansea), pockets of poor air quality exist at the roadside but the 
closest AQMA is more than 4.5 km from the Project Site. 
6.3.9 
No monitoring of pollutants relevant to this assessment including 
nitrogen oxide or carbon monoxide is undertaken by CCS in the study 
area.  Baseline concentrations of these pollutants are presented in the 
following section.

Mapped Background Pollutant Concentrations 
6.3.10 
Defra provides mapped background pollutant concentrations for the UK 
on a 1 km x 1 km grid.  For nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, data 
have been provided by Defra as hindcasts/predictions for all years from 
2010 to 2030.  For CO, data have been provided for 2001 with factors to 
project data to later years. 
6.3.11 
The background pollutant concentrations are currently well within the air 
quality objectives for the protection of human health and ecosystems 
(Table 6.3).  It is anticipated that concentrations will, in general, decrease 
over time as result of a predicted overall reduction in emissions from all 
emission sources and sectors, both in the UK and in Europe.  However, 
the rate of improvement is uncertain, particularly in the short to medium 
term and, as such, the quantitative assessment of impacts does take into 
account this expected improvement in air quality.  Nevertheless, the 
implications for the likely improvement in air quality over time are 
considered qualitatively.

A comparison of the mapped Defra concentrations for 2014 with 
concentrations monitored at automatic monitoring sites by NRW 
indicated that the upper range of mapped data for the study area are 
aligned with concentrations recorded at the roadside and urban 
background locations. It is anticipated that concentrations at the Project 
Site will be significantly lower to concentrations recorded at roadside and 
urban background sites.  This is reflected in the mapped data for the 
Project Site in Table 6.3.  
6.3.13 
Short term background pollutant concentrations (averaging periods <=8 
hours and, on a precautionary basis, 24 hours) will be set to twice the 
annual mean background concentration.  This follows EA/NRW 
guidance.

Ecological sites  
6.3.17 
The area includes numerous nature conservation sites relevant to the air 
quality assessment.  Following the EA Annex F – Air Emissions 
guidance, the assessment should consider the ecological designated 
sites listed in Chapter 8 and shown on Figure 8.1 and 8.2 
6.3.18 
The main ecological value of the Project Site lies with the marshy 
grassland or ‘purple moor-grass and rush pastures’, ‘ponds’ and the 
‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ which are all Section 42 habitats 
under the NERC Act and are located within SINCs.

The ES will consider the potential impacts on human receptors from 
emissions to air from the Project by making reference to the air quality 
objectives (see Table 6.1).  The air quality objectives are health based 
criteria that ensure that pollutant concentrations do no cause adverse 
health effects. Therefore impacts on public heath will be considered as 
part of the assessment of impacts on human receptors.

mitigation measures outlined in Section 2.13 will ensure that any effects 
are, at worst, slight adverse. 
6.9 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
6.9.1 
There are a number of reasonably foreseeable developments in the 
vicinity of the Project Site (see Section 4.8). The most relevant in regards 
to air quality is a solar project located at Abergelli Farm, north east of the 
Project Site. Depending on the construction schedule of the solar project 
and the Project, potential cumulative effects might arise, particularly in 
the residential receptors in Abergelli Farm as well as residential 
properties along the access routes. The cumulative assessment of the 
ES will consider any potential in-combination effects during construction 
in the event that the projects are constructed in parallel. 
6.9.2 
Further consultation with CCS and NRW during the ES preparation will 
confirm whether any further development is anticipated in proximity to 
the Project. 
6.9.3 
It is anticipated that any cumulative effects can be mitigated through the 
implementation of a CEMP (as outlined in Section 2.13) and a CTMP. 
Therefore is reasonable to assume that after mitigation effects will be 
minor adverse and, moreover, temporary.  
Operation 
6.9.4 
The reasonably foreseeable developments presented in Section 4.8 are 
not associated with significant emissions as they are mainly renewable 
energy projects (wind and solar). It is therefore reasonable to assume 
that potential effects from the Power Generating Plant will remain 
unchanged 
after 
considering 
the 
currently 
known 
committed 
developments. Therefore cumulative effects during operations based on 
current knowledge will be minor.   
6.9.5 
Further consultation will be sought with CCS and NRW to determine a 
definitive list of significant emission sources to consider as part of the air 
quality assessment in the ES. 
6.10 
Summary and Conclusions 
6.10.1 
It is considered unlikely that there will be permanent residual effects 
associated with the construction of the Project. The effects relating to 
construction activities are all temporary.

Effects during operation of the Power Generation Plant are not expected 
to be significant i.e. impacts outside of the area shaded in light green in 
the significant table (Table 6.1). A detailed stack sensitivity assessment 
has been undertaken to ensure that dispersion of emissions is sufficient 
and significant effects do not arise in nearby human and ecological 
receptors. In addition stack emission monitoring, undertaken as part of 
the operation of the Generating Equipment to meet Environmental 
Permitting Regulations, will ensure that emissions meet the prescribed 
limits of the IED.

NOISE AND VIBRATION 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
This chapter provides the noise and vibration preliminary environmental 
assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power Project based upon 
assessment carried out up to end of September 2014.  The proposed 
development is set out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for 
the assessment carried out to date.   
7.1.2 
The following factors have specifically been taken account of in this 
preliminary assessment.  The project assessment scenario is based on 
the possible worst case land take to accommodate the Project Site which 
presents a worst case scenario from a noise and vibration point of view.  
The assessment has considered potentially significant effects which may 
be caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project on noise sensitive receptors in and around the vicinity of the 
Project Site. 
7.1.3 
Embedded mitigation in relation to ecology consists of the production of 
a CEMP (see Section 2.13).  Monitoring will ensure the measures are 
effective. 
7.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
7.2.1 
The noise assessment in the PEIR has taken account of planning policy 
and guidance set out in Section 3, as well as the following documents: 
 The Environmental Noise (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2009; 
 The Noise Action Plan for Wales;  
 British Standard (BS) 7445 'Description and Measurement of 
Environmental Noise'; BS 4142 'Method for rating industrial noise 
affecting mixed residential and industrial areas'; EA Horizontal 
Guidance H3 Part 2: Noise assessment and control; 
 
 World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for Community Noise;
 
  
 BS 5228 'Noise and vibration control on construction and open sites';  
 BS 6472 (2008) 'Guide to Evaluation of Human Exposure to 
Vibration in Buildings (1 Hertz (Hz) to 80 Hz)'; and 
 BS 7385 (1993) 'Evaluation and Measurement for Vibration in 
Buildings'.

Assessment Methodology 
7.2.2 
The assessment methodologies used in the PEIR are the same as those 
that will be adopted for the EIA. However, the level of detail available at 
the PEIR stage is only sufficient to form preliminary conclusions and 
more detailed information will be required for the EIA.    
7.2.3 
Construction and decommissioning noise and vibration assessments of 
the Project has been undertaken following the guidance in British 
Standard (BS) 522841. The assessment has been undertaken as a desk 
study and involved:   
 
Identification of construction and decommissioning activities that 
produce significant noise and vibration; and 
 
Prediction of noise and vibration using the methodology 
contained within BS5228.  
7.2.4 
The exact construction and decommissioning methodologies are unlikely 
to be defined until the construction contractor is appointed, which is likely 
to be after the submission of the Application for a Development Consent 
Order. However, in the absence of this information, an outline 
construction programme has been developed based on knowledge and 
experience of other similar developments. Additionally, the typical make 
up of construction equipment at each stage of the Project programme 
has been ascertained in the same way. For ground improvement works 
(e.g. piling) the noise and vibration assessment has paid due regard to 
the ground conditions at the Generating Equipment Site. Where 
uncertainties exist, realistic worst case assumptions have been used.  
7.2.5 
The quantification of impacts has been undertaken by comparison with 
agreed project criteria or limits either from previous schemes and 
relevant guidance and standards such as BS5228, BS647242 and 
BS738543, or local legislative requirements. The desk study has outlined 
suitable 
measures 
for 
the 
mitigation 
of 
construction 
and 
decommissioning impacts, and an assessment of residual effects and 
effects.   
7.2.6 
Table 7.1 sets out the construction noise significance threshold taken 
from BS 5228 for day, night, evening and weekend periods.

7.2.7 
There are various indices for expressing the noise levels produced by 
working sites.  However, the LAeq index is regarded as standard and has 
been used in this assessment. LAeq is the equivalent continuous sound 
level expressed in "A weighted" decibel terms and is, in general, used as 
a description of environmental noise.  It represents the steady sound 
level, which will produce the same energy as a fluctuating sound, over 
the same period of time.   
7.2.8 
Vibration from construction activities may impact on adjacent buildings.  
The criteria used in this assessment relates to the potential for cosmetic 
damage, not structural damage.  The principal concern is generally 
vibration due to impact piling.  Cosmetic damage is most likely to occur 
within the first 20 m of piling activities; damage is less likely to occur at 
greater distance.  Likely levels of vibration at given distances can be 
predicted from existing piling vibration data. 
7.2.9 
BS7385 establishes the basic principles for carrying out vibration 
measurements and processing the data with regard to evaluating 
vibration impacts on buildings.  Table 7.2 provides recommended peak 
particle velocity (PPV) vibration limits for transient excitation for different 
types of buildings (as set out in BS7385: Part 2, 1993).

should not be exceeded.   
7.2.10 
Due to the minimum distance of a 230 m to the closest neighbouring 
structure (NG Compressor Station), a detailed construction vibration 
assessment has not been included in the PEIR. 
7.2.11 
Operational noise for the PEIR has been assessed using preliminary 
data. The operational noise for the EIA will utilise more detailed 
information and assess the impact using the methodology from a 
combination of: BS414244; BS823345; and WHO Guidelines for 
Community Noise46, as appropriate. The likelihood of complaints about 
noise from industrial developments will be predicted using the following 
criteria from BS4142:  
 
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints;  
 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints 
are likely; 
 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance; and 
 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely.  
7.2.12 
The guidance contained in BS8233 will also be used to assess the 
effects on indoor ambient noise levels in living rooms and bedrooms of 
NSRs when they are unoccupied.   
7.2.13 
The WHO ‘Guidelines for Community Noise’ provides health-based 
guidance on suitable noise levels intended to avoid or minimise 
community annoyance by noise. The guidance provides guideline noise 
levels for both indoor and outdoor areas.    
7.2.14 
A baseline noise survey has been undertaken in the vicinity of the Project 
Site to establish the current baseline noise levels. The monitoring 
locations for the baseline survey included a selection of the nearest noise 
sensitive receptors that represents the local area. These locations were 
agreed in advance with CCS. 
7.2.15 
Following baseline noise measurements, a noise model has been 
produced using Cadna software (3-dimensional noise propagation 
software) which models the measured baseline levels at NSRs, together 
with sound power levels of proposed plant (obtained from relevant

suppliers). Where sound power levels for proposed plant were not 
available, suitable data has been substituted, where a realistic worst 
case scenario has been considered. The noise model highlights the main 
noise sources and the associated noise levels at the NSR locations. 
Contour plots will be produced clearly showing noise levels at the Project 
Site, NSRs and surrounding areas in the EIA.   
7.2.16 
If the model (once the more detailed information has been included in 
the EIA) shows that there is potential for a significant effect to be 
generated by noise at any of the NSRs, the level of required noise 
mitigation would be specified, and measures that could be used to 
achieve this level of mitigation will be incorporated into the model, to 
provide a ‘with mitigation’ scenario.  
7.2.17 
The operation of the Gas Connection is not anticipated to cause any 
significant increase in background noise or vibration and therefore this 
element has been scoped out of the assessment.   
7.2.18 
Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has also been scoped 
out as there will be no significant effects associated with the buried 
electrical cable. 
Significance Criteria 
7.2.19 
Significance criteria for construction noise and vibration have been 
derived from BS5228, and BS7385.  An adapted scale for the description

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
7.3.1 
There are currently no sources of significant noise or vibration within 
close proximity to the Project Site other than those associated with 
nearby agricultural activities, Team Force Swansea Paintball Centre and 
a skip hire business as well as the M4 motorway approximately 1.5 km 
to the south.  National Grid’s two electrical substations and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station are assumed to operate within agreed thresholds.   
7.3.2 
The closest NSRs within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau, Llwyncelyn and Felindre. In 
addition there are also isolated dwellings and farmsteads outside of the 
settlements including but not exclusive to:

Baseline Noise Survey 
7.3.3 
Discussions were held with CCS and NRW in August 2014 to agree a 
study area, a noise survey methodology, and suitable locations for the 
survey measurement positions. The Study Area is determined by the 
location of NSRs in relation to the project (see Appendix 7.1, Figure 1). 
7.3.4 
A noise survey was then undertaken to determine the spread of noise in 
the area, a number of attended short term sampling measurements were 
taken at pre-determined NSR over a period of 24hrs.  In addition, two 
unattended long term noise monitors were used, these measured 
statistical broadband noise levels continuously at two NSR locations for 
a period of 7 days. 
7.3.5 
Table 7.5 contains a summary of the NSR measurement locations from 
the baseline survey. The Baseline Survey Report in Appendix 7.1 
describes the exact locations used and provides a location plan to show 
measurement positions used during the survey.

7.3.6 
Baseline noise measurements were taken at each of the NSR’s between 
19th and 26th August 2014.  Weather conditions were conducive to 
successful monitoring with wind speeds less than 5 m/s.  Roads were 
dry, and there was no precipitation at the time of measurement.  The 
measurement microphones were positioned in free field at 1.4 m above 
ground level and well away from any vertical reflective facades.  A wind-
shield was used to minimise the effects of wind noise.  The ambient 
temperature was between 13°C and 21°C during the monitoring period.  
7.3.7 
Each measurement recorded the same five statistical parameters (L90, 
Leq, Lmax, L10, Lmin.) in unweighted third octave bands, with the overall 
figure reported using the A-weighed frequency network. 
7.3.8 
All monitoring was conducted using Class 1 Sound Level Meters.  A field 
calibrator was used to calibrate and check the meter before and after the 
measurement period with no change in level recorded.  Specific details 
of the equipment used, including serial numbers and calibration dates is 
provided in Appendix 7.1. 
7.3.9 
To provide a worst case background noise level to assess against the 
lowest LA90 from either the daytime or night time measurements at each 
NSR have been used.   
7.3.10 
The full results of the baseline noise measurements are presented in the 
noise monitoring forms in Appendix 7.2.  Table 7.6 summarises the 
lowest LA90 measured at each NSR position during the baseline noise 
survey.

Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Construction/Decommissioning 
Vibration from Construction Activities 
7.4.1 
The identified construction plant/equipment items used in this 
assessment are not recognised as sources of high levels of vibration.  
Indeed, even at a close distance of 10 m, PPV levels significantly less 
than 1 mm/s are generated.  For example, a bulldozer will typically 
generate a PPV of approximately 0.6 mm/s and a “heavy lorry on poor 
road surface” will generate a PPV of less than 0.1 mm/s.  These values 
are well below limits at which cosmetic building damage becomes likely 
(15 mm/s). As such, vibration impacts from construction activities are 
considered to be negligible. 
Noise from Construction Activities – Construction Traffic 
7.4.2 
Access roads will be used by construction traffic wherever possible. 
These access roads are identified as Access Options 1 and 2 in Chapter 
2 and the predicted noise impacts for each option are included in Table 
7.8. Accordingly, noise generated by construction traffic will increase 
noise levels on the affected strategic/local roads.   
7.4.3 
However, it is noted that any increases in noise levels will represent a 
temporary increase which will be restricted to the duration of the 
construction activities.   
Noise from Construction Activities – Power Generation Plant Site 
7.4.4 
Individual assessment of each identified construction plant / equipment 
item has been undertaken in order to assess the likely noise level at the 
NSR's.    
7.4.5 
At this stage detailed phasing for construction at the Generating 
Equipment Site is not available. Preliminary calculations have been 
undertaken based on typical representative plant items. Sound power 
level data for each plant item has been taken from BS5228. The

Operation 
Generating Equipment Site 
7.4.9 
A preliminary assessment has been completed using a cumulative sound 
power level for the typical Generating Equipment options identified for 
use. From these preliminary calculations the operational noise level from 
the Generating Equipment Site at each identified NSR location is 
predicted to range between 40 dB to 47 dB LAeq. With no mitigation in 
place these plant noise levels would result in a major noise impact at the 
receptor locations.

Noise from Construction Activities – Construction Traffic 
7.5.1 
Either Access Road Option 1 or 2 will be used for site access. 
Accordingly, noise generated by construction traffic using either Access 
Road Option 1 or 2 will increase noise levels on the affected 
Strategic/Local Roads.   
7.5.2 
It is noted that any increases in noise levels will represent a temporary 
increase which will be restricted to the duration of the construction 
activities.  The noise generated by construction traffic will also vary as 
day-to-day progress is made along the length of the Gas Connection. As 
construction progresses along the length of the route, the construction 
noise sources will move along with it, hence noise levels will reduce. 
Noise from Construction Activities

The detailed construction noise calculations are provided in Appendix

Table 7.10 identifies that predicted noise levels from the Gas Connection

NSR 6 where a major noise impact is predicted.  This major noise impact 
is due to the shorter distance between the noise source and property.

Table 7.14 provides a summary of construction noise impacts and 
mitigation measures for the construction of the main power plant site. 
7.6.9 
The effects from decommissioning are considered to mirror construction 
impacts and therefore they are assessed collectively. 
Table 7.14:  Findings of Preliminary Assessment of Effects of 
Electrical Connection during Construction/Decommissioning 
 
Operation 
7.6.10 
Noise and vibration impacts from the operation of the Electrical 
Connection are considered to be Negligible.  Therefore, no mitigation or 
monitoring measures are considered necessary.

Project (as a whole) 
7.7.1 
The noise and vibration effects of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are comparatively minor so the effects of the Project as a 
whole are the same as described for the Power Generation Plant. 
7.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
7.8.1 
Preliminary calculations have been undertaken to predict the potential 
cumulative noise impacts during the construction phase. These 
calculations provide the predicted noise impact from construction works 
being undertaken concurrently on the Power Generation Plant Site, the 
Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection. The results of the 
cumulative construction noise assessment are presented in Table 7.16.

7.8.2 
The predicted cumulative construction noise levels shown in Table 7.17 
are prior to any mitigation being applied. It is anticipated that effects will 
be reduced to minor at all NSR locations with the application of the noise 
mitigation measures identified in this study. 
7.8.3 
Any cumulative construction activities from other projects will be 
considered in the ES 
Operation 
7.8.4 
Noise impacts from the operation of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are identified in this study as negligible. Therefore, the 
cumulative operational noise impacts will be equal to the Generating 
Equipment running in isolation, identified as minor to moderate impact in 
Table 7.9 (unmitigated).

ECOLOGY 
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 
This chapter provides the Ecological preliminary environmental 
assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power Project based upon 
assessment carried out up to end of September 2014.  The proposed 
development is set out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for 
the assessment carried out to date.   
8.1.2 
The following factors have specifically been taken account of in this 
preliminary assessment.  The project assessment scenario is based on 
the possible works case land take to accommodate the Project Site 
which presents worst case scenario from an ecological point of view.  
The assessment has considered potentially significant effects which may 
be caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project on ecological resources and receptors in and around the vicinity 
of the Project Site. 
8.1.3 
Embedded mitigation in relation to ecology consists of the production of 
a CEMP (see Section 2.13).  Monitoring will ensure the measures are 
effective. 
8.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
8.2.1 
The EcIA in the PEIR has taken account of planning policy and guidance 
set out in Section 3, as well as the following documents: 
 Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010;  
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended); 
 The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW Act);  
 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (NERC Act) 
2006;  
 The Protection of Badgers Act 1992;  
 The Hedgerows Regulations (1997);  
 UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework; and 
 Swansea Biodiversity Action Plan (Swansea BAP).

Assessment Methodology 
8.2.2 
The preliminary EcIA provides an assessment of any potentially 
significant effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated 
sites of ecological or geological conservation importance, on protected 
species and on habitats and other species identified as being of principal 
importance 
for 
the 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity. 
Furthermore 
opportunities will be taken, where practicable, to conserve and enhance 
biodiversity and geological conservation interests. NPS EN-1 also 
requires that lighting effects will be considered on sensitive ecological 
receptors. 
8.2.3 
The full EcIA will be undertaken in accordance with the relevant guidance 
including the Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (Institute of 
Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM), 2006)47. Consultation 
has been undertaken with NRW and CCS to identify any particular issues 
of concern following the scoping stage.   
8.2.4 
The assessment methodology employed for the EcIA involves five key 
stages:  
 
Stage 1: Consultations; consultations so far have concentrated on 
the scoping responses received to date;  
 
Stage 2: Baseline Studies and Evaluation of Ecological 
Receptors;  desk studies, Phase 1 Habitat surveys and Phase 2 
protected species surveys have been undertaken for the Project;   
 
Stage 3: Identification of Valued Ecological Receptors (VER). This 
has been undertaken during the above steps;  
 
Stage 4: Identification and Characterisation of Potential Impacts.  
Initial impacts and effects are outlined in this PEIR and a further 
characterisation of impacts and effects will be provided in the final 
ES; and   
 
Stage 5: Assessment of Significant Effects.  This stage will be 
completed as part of the final ES.   
8.2.5 
For the purposes of the EcIA, sites, species populations, species 
assemblages and habitats will be valued using the geographical scale 
detailed in Table 8.2.  The valuation of sites makes use of any 
established systems, with examples provided in the table.  However, 
professional ecological judgement has been used to attribute value to 
receptors considered to be of district value or below. The potential likely 
significant effects on ecological receptors from the Project during 
construction, operation and decommissioning will be identified and

characterised.  In identifying these effects, a number of parameters are 
taken into account. 
8.2.6 
The parameters used to determine the nature and magnitude of the 
impact are centred upon the: size or intensity of the impact, which is 
measured in relevant terms. For example, the number of individuals lost 
or gained; area of habitat lost or created; or, the degree of change to 
existing conditions such as noise or lighting levels. The magnitude of 
impacts also considered the following: 
 
Positive or negative – whether the impact will result in net loss or 
degradation of a Valued Ecological Receptors (VER) or whether 
it will enhance or improve it; 
 
Magnitude – the size or intensity of the impact measured in 
relevant terms, e.g. number of individuals lost or gained, area of 
habitat lost of created or the degree of change to existing 
conditions (e.g. noise or lighting levels); 
 
Duration – the length of time over which the impact occurs; 
 
Reversibility – the extent to which impacts are reversible either 
through natural regeneration and succession or through active 
mitigation; and 
 
Timing and frequency – consideration of the timing of events in 
relation to ecological change, some impacts may be of greater 
magnitude if they take place at certain times of year (e.g. breeding 
season).  The extent to which an impact is repeated may also be 
of importance. 
8.2.7 
Furthermore, impacts can be permanent or temporary, direct, secondary 
or indirect and can be cumulative.  
8.2.8 
These factors are brought together to assess the magnitude of the 
impact on particular VERs and, wherever possible, the magnitude of the 
impact is quantified. Professional judgment is then used to assign the 
effects on the receptors to one of four classes of magnitude, defined in 
Table 8.1. 
Table 8.1 - Definition of Magnitude 
Magnitude 
Definition 
High 
A permanent or long-term effect on the extent or size or integrity 
of a site, habitat, species assemblage or community, population 
or group. If adverse, this is likely to threaten its sustainability; if 
beneficial, this is likely to enhance its conservation status.

Magnitude 
Definition 
Medium 
A permanent or long-term effect on the extent or size or integrity 
of a site, habitat, species assemblage or community, population 
or group.  A short-term effect which will adversely affect the 
integrity of a receptor in a permanent manner.  If adverse, this is 
unlikely to threaten its sustainability; if beneficial this is likely to be 
sustainable but is unlikely to enhance its conservation status. 
Low 
A permanent, long-term reversible or short-term effect on a site, 
habitat, species assemblage or community, population or group 
whose magnitude is detectable but will not threaten/change its 
conservation status. 
Negligible 
A short-term reversible effect on the extent, size or integrity of a 
site, habitat, species assemblage or community, population or 
group that is within the normal range. 
 
8.2.9 
The value of sites, habitats, species assemblages and populations of 
species is evaluated with reference to both their importance in terms of 
‘biodiversity conservation’ value (which relates to the need to conserve 
representative areas of different habitats and the genetic diversity of 
species populations) and their legal status.   
8.2.10 
A review of the legislation, policy and sensitivity of the ecological receptor 
is undertaken and the value of the receptor was determined within a 
geographical context on the following basis:  
 
International; 
 
UK; 
 
National (Wales); 
 
Regional; 
 
County; 
 
District; 
 
Local;  
 
Neighbourhood/Site; and 
 
Negligible.

Significance Criteria 
8.2.11 
The significance of the predicted effects on VERs arising from the 
identified impacts of the Project, including embedded and additional 
mitigation measures, is assessed.  Significance is assessed as negative, 
positive or not significant. 
Adverse Effects 
8.2.12 
For habitat areas and species, an effect is considered to be significant if 
the conservation status of a VER is compromised by the final design of 
the Prooject.  Conservation status is defined by the Institute of Ecology 
and Environmental Management1 (IEEM) as follows: 
 
Habitats – “conservation status is determined by the sum of the 
influences acting on the habitat and its typical species that may 
affect its long-term distribution, structure and functions as well as 
the long-term survival of its typical species within a given 
geographical area”. 
 
Species – “conservation status is determined by the sum of the 
influences acting on the species concerned that may affect the 
long-term distribution and abundance of its populations within a 
given geographical area”. 
8.2.13 
The decision as to whether the conservation status of a VER is likely to 
be compromised is made using professional judgement based on an 
analysis of the predicted effects of the Project (including consideration of 
the specific parameters outlined above). 
8.2.14 
A similar procedure is used for designated sites that are potentially 
affected by the Project, except that the focus is on the effects on the 
integrity of each site, defined as “the coherence of ecological structure 
and function, across a site’s whole area, that enable it to sustain the 
habitat, complex of habitats and/or levels of populations of species for 
which it was classified”48.  This assessment is made with reference to 
the features for which a site has been classified/notified and involves 
combining assessments of the effects on the conservation status of each 
of these features. 
Beneficial Effects 
8.2.15 
A positive or ‘beneficial’ effect is considered to be significant if the 
Project’s activities cause: 
 
A non-valued ecological receptor to become valued;

 
Restoration 
of 
favourable 
conservation 
status 
for 
a 
habitat/species population; and/or, 
 
Restoration of a site’s integrity (where this has been undermined). 
8.2.16 
Following the assessment of how each VER may be affected and its 
subsequent 
level 
of 
significance, 
relevant 
mitigation 
and/or 
compensation measures (in addition to the embedded mitigation) are 
identified.  Once identified, the mitigation will be designed to reduce 
potential significant negative effects.  With respect to nature 
conservation sites that support protected species, there may also be a 
legal obligation to provide such mitigation. 
8.2.17 
The likely effectiveness of all the mitigation is then assessed and the 
residual effects described. 
8.2.18 
The assumptions used as to whether an effect is significant or not are 
set out in paragraph 4.6.3. 
8.2.19 
It should be noted that the study/survey area used for the baseline 
ecological surveys covered a larger area than that of the final layout to 
allow flexibility in the final design location. Therefore some 
species/habitats recorded mentioned in the baseline reports may not be 
present in the reduced application boundary. 
Desk Study Methodology 
8.2.20 
A desk study was undertaken to review records of protected/notable 
species and habitats within a defined study area.  The study area radius 
was 10 km from the Project Site for all statutory designated sites and bat 
records, 2 km for non-statutory designated sites, and protected/notable 
species.  The respective study area radii were considered suitable for 
the scale and type of the proposed development.   
8.2.21 
The South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) was 
contacted to obtain appropriate data.  The web-based database Multi 
Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC)49 was also 
consulted. 
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Assessment  
8.2.22 
An Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey was undertaken in February and 
July 2014. The survey followed standard methodology published by the 
Joint Nature Conservation Committee50 (2010) with habitat types present

are currently ongoing on and surrounding the Project Site. 
Badgers  
8.2.24 
All potential habitats within and surrounding the Project Site are being 
surveyed in line with methodologies detailed in ‘Surveying Badgers’51.  
The survey includes search for and record characteristic signs of badger 
(Meles meles) activity, including: setts, latrine pits, foraging holes, 
badger hair and paw prints following best practice guidance (‘Best 
Practice Guidelines for Badger Surveys’52 issued by Scottish Natural 
Heritage - these guidelines are also applicable to England and Wales). 
Potential habitat includes areas of woodland, scrub and hedgerows.  
Dormouse 
8.2.25 
A dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) survey is being undertaken 
following a methodology based on those prescribed in best practice 
guidance (Bright et al, 2006)53. The surveys involve the use of dormouse 
boxes and nest tubes in areas of woodland, scrub and hedgerows. The 
survey is designed to detect the presence or absence of dormice.   
Otter and Water Vole 
8.2.26 
A survey for water voles (Arvicola amphibius) and otters (Lutra lutra) 
along the banks of the water courses was carried out in accordance with 
best practice guidelines (Chanin (2003)54 and Strachan et al., (2011)55

respectively). Signs that water voles may be present were indicated by 
the presence of feeding remains, characteristic grass lawns, burrows, 
runs, footprints, latrines and droppings.  Signs that otters may be present 
were indicated by the presence of spraints and footprints. 
Bats 
8.2.27 
A roped-access tree survey is being carried out for trees to be removed 
or modified that have been identified as having potential to support 
roosting bats. Where the potential for bats to roost in a surveyed tree is 
confirmed then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey will be 
carried out to confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the 
status of any roost present.   
8.2.28 
In addition bat activity surveys are being carried out across the Project 
Site in accordance with the guidance provided by Hundt (2012)56 which 
involves walked transect routes carried out monthly between April and 
October 2014 and an automated survey using static bat detectors. These 
surveys will determine the species of bats present on the Project Site as 
well as the spatial distribution and relative activity levels of these species.   
Breeding birds 
8.2.29 
The breeding bird survey focuses on the farmland birds (occurring both 
within the Project Site and a buffer of up to 50 m). Their territories were 
mapped using surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s 
Common Bird Census (CBC)57 methodology with three site visits carried 
out in mid-April, May and June.   
Great Crested Newts  
8.2.30 
Preliminary pond surveys (Habitat Suitability Index Assessment) based 
on the standard approach detailed in the Herpetological Journal 
publication; Evaluating the Suitability of Habitat for the Great Crested 
Newt (Triturus cristatus) (GCN)58 indicated that there are a number of 
ponds within 250 m of the Project Site which are potentially suitable for 
great crested newts. GCN presence/absence surveys were carried out 
using standard methodologies in accordance with the Great Crested 
Newt Mitigation Guidelines59, between mid-March to mid-June 2014 to 
establish presence or absence and to estimate population size if great

crested newts are found during the surveys. More detail on the 
methodology is provided in Appendix 8.4. 
Reptiles 
8.2.31 
A reptile survey is being carried out on the Project Site to establish the 
presence/absence of reptiles, the species present and the approximate 
population size. The survey uses artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and 
corrugated tins) to aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of their 
distribution and abundance, following good practice guidance, including 
that set out in the Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 
200360) and Reptile Survey Guidance (Froglife, 199961).   
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates 
8.2.32 
The block of marshy grassland to the west of Abergelli Farm, has been 
surveyed for marsh fritillary butterflies (Euphydryas aurinia) following 
standard methods62 for walking transects during late May/June looking 
for adults and larval webs during mid-August to mid-September.   
8.2.33 
A survey of Lepidoptera (notably moths) has been undertaken in the 
woodland within the Project Site in late spring and mid-summer. The 
survey will involve two night-time moth surveys using Skinner or 
Robinson moth traps fitted with mercury vapour bulbs. Any species hard 
to identify from external markings alone, and those requiring further 
confirmation, will be retained and dissected if necessary to ascertain 
their identity with the use of a stereoscopic microscope.   
8.2.34 
Beetle assemblages in the woodland within the Project Site will be 
sampled using a method following the Natural England (ISIS) protocol 
(Drake et al, 2007)63 via hand searches, sweep netting and pitfall 
trapping. Subsequent laboratory identification will be required for many 
of the specimens collected.   
8.2.35 
In order to determine the assemblage of aquatic invertebrates present 
on Project Site, the flowing ditches and ponds will be surveyed.   
8.2.36 
Kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates will be undertaken at selected 
locations along ditches or streams. Furthermore the water chemistry 
status will be determined for watercourses by extracting a single water 
sample at three locations within as well as upstream and downstream of

the Project Site. Samples will be dispatched to a UKAS accredited 
laboratory for subsequent analysis.   
8.2.37 
The national pond monitoring survey protocol will be adhered to for 
surveying ponds which involves timed netting and searches for 
invertebrates in summer (but may also cover spring and autumn).   
National Vegetation Classification Survey 
8.2.38 
National Vegetation Classification (NVC) surveys were undertaken for 
the potentially important habitats within the Project Site such as the areas 
within SINCs and Ancient Woodlands.  The survey followed standard 
methodology devised by Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) 
NVC Users Handbook64.   
8.2.39 
Each parcel of land included in the survey was initially walked by the 
surveyor to map the broad community types with the aid of aerial 
photographs. Sample quadrats were then marked out in blocks of 
vegetation that were considered representative of each community type. 
A list of all botanical species within that quadrat was composed, with the 
associated Domin score applied. The lists of species generated were 
evaluated against the keys and community accounts in the relevant 
British Plant Community Volume65 to establish the closest fit to a NVC 
community. 
Invasive Species 
8.2.40 
A walkover survey of the Project Site was carried out to map all locations 
where Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and Himalayan balsam 
(Impatiens glandulifera) are growing. This was done within the period 
June to July when both species are most in evidence. 
Limitations 
8.2.41 
The limitations of the site surveys are set out in the Reports prepared by 
BSG in Appendix 8.1 to 8.5.  The main limitation to all of the surveys was 
lack of access to land surrounding the Project Site outside of the 
applicant’s control.  The robustness of the assessments is discussed in 
detail in the appended species reports. 
8.2.42 
A further limitation of the preliminary assessment set out in the PEIR is 
that not all of the surveys were complete. Where this is the case, interim

Habitats 
8.3.4 
The Project Site is predominantly on pastoral farmland, mostly 
agriculturally improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland 
and interspersed by woodland and scrub. Some of the marshy grassland 
qualifies as a Section 42 habitat ‘purple moor-grass and rush pastures’ 
(under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 
(NERC)66) and is designated as SINCs. Furthermore areas of the 
woodland qualify as Section 42 habitat ‘lowland mixed deciduous 
woodland’, some of which is also classified as Ancient Woodland and 
SINCs. The Ancient Woodland and SINCs are shown on Figure 8.2.  
8.3.5 
The fields are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by 
fences running along the line of defunct hedgerows with large gaps. 
There are numerous watercourses on site, mostly in the form of ditches 
or streams along field boundaries. There is a potential for bats, great 
crested newts, dormice, otters, water voles, reptiles, badger, woodland 
and farmland bird species and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to be 
located within these habitats. Full details of the habitats located within 
the Project Site and the potential for protected species and species of 
conservation importance are provided in Appendix 8.1 to 8.5 and will be 
updated in the ES.

Badgers  
8.3.6 
Signs of badgers were recorded during other surveys so they are known 
to be present in the wider area, however targeted badger surveys are 
still on-going and therefore the presence/absence of this species is not 
currently known.   
Dormouse 
8.3.7 
Dormice 
surveys 
are 
currently 
on-going 
and 
therefore 
the 
presence/absence of this species is not currently known. No dormice 
have been found to date, however further checks are yet to be 
undertaken. 
Otter  
8.3.8 
The desk study provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search 
radius, with the closest record 0.5 km to the south west of the River Llan. 
During the 2014 surveys a single fresh otter spraint was found in the 
stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site. No other 
signs were observed that confirm otter presence in the other water 
courses within the Survey Site. Full details of the survey are provided in 
Appendix 8.2. 
8.3.9 
The habitats on site present potential for resting places and some 
foraging potential however this is limited due to the shallow nature of the 
streams that reduce the likelihood of fish presence.   
Water Vole 
8.3.10 
No recent (within the past 10 years) water vole records were returned by 
the desk study, however historical records (from 1996) were provided 
from the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Project Site. Full 
details of the survey are provided in Appendix 8.2. 
8.3.11 
No field signs were observed during the surveys that clearly establish the 
presence of water vole. Habitats on site present potential for breeding, 
foraging and commuting water voles.  
Bats 
8.3.12 
Roost surveys of buildings within the Survey Site confirmed that at least 
four buildings contained bat droppings and were confirmed as bat roosts. 
Droppings from at least three species of bats (pipistrelle species 
(Pipistrellus sp.), long-eared bat species (Plecotus sp.) and lesser 
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros)) were found. None of 
buildings will be directly affected by the Project.

8.3.13 
35 trees were located within the Survey Site that were considered to 
present potential to support roosting bats. A total of 31 trees were 
climbed using ladders or rope access. Emergence and/or re-entry 
surveys were carried out on eight of these trees and no bats were 
recorded emerging from or entering these potential tree roosts. 
8.3.14 
Activity surveys across the Project Site are currently on-going and 
therefore the status of this species is not currently known. However, 
preliminary activity survey findings recorded at least eight species of bats 
using the Survey Site; common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), 
soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus), Myotis sp., long-eared bat 
species, noctule (Nyctalus noctula), serotine (Eptesicus serotinus), 
lesser horseshoe bat, and greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus 
ferrumequinum).  
8.3.15 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded during every survey 
and occurred in most of the Survey Site. Myotis species were the next 
frequently recorded species with the other species being recorded 
infrequently and in low numbers. The highest numbers of passes were 
recorded along linear features such as hedges or streams, with lower 
activity over open fields. 
Breeding birds 
8.3.16 
Breeding bird surveys have been undertaken between May-June and the 
survey results are summarised here. Seven bird ‘species of principal 
importance for nature conservation’ as referred to in Section 42 of the 
NERC Act 2006 (dunnock (Prunella modularis), house sparrow (Passer 
domesticus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), lesser redpoll (Carduelis 
cabaret), skylark (Alauda arvensis), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), 
and tree pipit (Anthus trivialis)) were considered likely to breed on site. 
All seven S42 species recorded within the Survey Site are also red-listed 
species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009), with the 
exception of dunnock (which is amber-listed). An additional seven 
amber-listed species, bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), mistle thrush (Turdus 
viscivorus), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), reed bunting (Emberiza 
schoeniclus), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), whitethroat 
(Sylvia communis) and willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) were also 
considered to have bred. Full details of the survey are provided in 
Appendix 8.3.   
Great Crested Newts  
8.3.17 
GCN presence/absence surveys have been undertaken and likely 
absence of species was recorded in all waterbodies subject to survey.  
All waterbodies within the Project Site and one pond situated within 250 
m from the Project Site boundary (total of five ponds) were included in 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
105 
Parsons Brinckerhoff

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
the surveys, one pond was considered unsuitable and seven ponds 
within 250 m from the Project Site boundary could not be accessed for 
the 2014 surveys. Given that as the suitable ponds within the Survey Site 
were not occupied by GCNs, and no GCN records have been located 
within 7 km of the Survey Site, it is unlikely that GCNs are present in the 
inaccessible ponds. Therefore for the purposes of this assessment the 
absence of GCN is assumed in all waterbodies within 250 m from the 
Project Site boundary. Full details of the survey are provided in Appendix 
8.4. 
Reptiles 
8.3.18 
Reptile presence/absence surveys across the Project Site are currently 
on-going, however to date common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) and grass 
snakes (Natrix natrix) were found present indicating a high common 
lizard population and a medium sized grass snake population.   
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates 
8.3.19 
Terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate surveys across the Project Site are 
currently on-going and therefore the results for this species group are not 
currently known.  Surveys to date were carried out during June-July 2014 
for moths, marsh fritillary (adults), terrestrial Coleoptera67, and aquatic 
macroinvertebrates (in ponds). A total of 217 species were recorded from 
the Survey Site. One species is Red Data Book (insufficiently known68), 
two are nationally scarce and ten are species of principal importance for 
nature conservation under Section 42. 
8.3.20 
Surveys are ongoing with the second survey (of two) scheduled in 
August (moths), late August-September 2014 (marsh fritillary larvae), 
and September 2014 (terrestrial Coleoptera). A survey of all 
watercourses/streams with running water within the Survey Site is also 
scheduled for September 2014. One survey of all ponds (containing 
water at the time of the survey) within the Survey Site was carried out in 
July and is sufficient for the purposes of the assessment. 
National Vegetation Classification Survey 
8.3.21 
NVC surveys have been undertaken and the survey results are currently 
being analysed. 
                                                      
67 Beetles. 
68 The category insufficiently known refers to species for which insufficient data exists to assign that species to 
another RDB category, e.g. rare or vulnerable.

Invasive Species 
8.3.22 
Invasive species surveys across the Project Site were completed and 
five species of plant included on Part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 
were recorded during the survey: Japanese knotweed (Fallopia 
japonica), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), rhododendron 
(Rhododendron 
ponticum), 
floating 
pennywort 
(Hydrocotyle 
ranunculoides) and montbretia (Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora). The final 
design will seek to avoid the locations where these species were 
recorded where possible. Should this not be possible suitable mitigation 
measures will be put in place. The need and/or extent of required 
mitigation will depend on the final design and cannot be detailed at this 
stage.

noteworthy terrestrial invertebrates were found present and impacts on these 
species and species groups are envisaged to be similar to impacts presented 
for other species and species groups above such as otters and breeding birds.  
Potential mitigation would include measures to reduce disturbance from 
operation activities (lighting schedule will take account of presence of bats).

Project (as a whole) 
8.7.1 
The nature of the impacts on ecological receptors for the Project (as a 
whole) is expected to be as per those detailed in the Tables above.  
However, their effects can not be quantified and assessed at this stage 
given that this will be informed by the indicative design. Impacts at a 
Project level on the European statutory designated sites will be assessed 
in the HRA Screening. 
8.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
8.8.1 
Cumulative effects will be considered in the ES for the three elements of 
the Project together (Project as a whole) as well as in combination with 
other schemes as detailed at Section 4.8.   
8.8.2 
Cumulative effects in combination with the proposed solar farm at 
Abergelli Farm are likely to result in low-medium effects on various 
ecological receptors given its proximity to the project site. 
Operation 
8.8.3 
The neighbouring schemes consist of wind turbines and solar panels 
with very small operational impacts. Given the proximity of one solar 
panel scheme low to medium cumulative effects may occur depending 
on final design however this will be assessed in detail in the ES.

WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
This chapter provides the water quality and resources preliminary 
environmental assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power Project 
based upon assessment carried out up to September 2014.  The Project 
is set out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for the assessment 
carried out to date.   
9.1.2 
The Project assessment scenario is as described in Chapter 2. The 
assessment scenario considers both access road options and assumes 
that surface water abstractions may be required for domestic water uses. 
Gas turbines that require water injection have already been ruled out 
therefore large scale abstraction for process water is not expected. This 
scenario is considered an appropriate worst case for assessment of 
water quality and resources impacts  
9.1.3 
The assessment assumes that sustainable drainage systems in 
accordance with current guidance will be used at the site to minimise 
impacts on flood risk and water quality and standard construction best 
practices will be followed (such as water protection measures in a 
CEMP) to reduce impacts on water quality. Embedded mitigation in the 
Project is described Section 2.13. 
9.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
9.2.1 
The water assessment presented in the PEIR has taken account of 
planning policy and guidance set out in Section 3, as well as the following 
documents: 
 
Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC);  
 
Flood and Water Management Act 2010; 
 
Flood Risk Regulations 2009; and 
 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010.  
Assessment Methodology 
9.2.2 
This preliminary assessment takes account of the existing status of, and 
impacts of the Project on water quality, water resources and physical 
characteristics of the water environment including any potential 
eutrophication impacts. The assessment has been undertaken using a 
risk based approach to determine the level of potential impacts by using 
a Source-Pathway-Receptor model to identify which receptors could 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
128 
Parsons Brinckerhoff

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
realistically be impacted by a given action. This included any sources of 
pollution that have the potential to impact on surface water bodies. 
9.2.3 
This preliminary assessment is based on a site visit and desk-based 
review of potential receptors. Hydrological features have been identified 
from OS mapping with information on geology, water quality and flood 
risk obtained from the Environment Agency website.   
9.2.4 
All aspects of supply, demand and disposal of water and process 
effluents have been addressed for the construction, operational and 
decommissioning phases. For the ES, potential discharge locations for 
site surface waters and process waste waters will be identified and a site 
drainage plan, which may incorporate a sustainable drainage system 
(SUDS), will be discussed at a high level.   
9.2.5 
There are not anticipated to be any significant impacts on key water 
bodies resulting from the Project through physical works to them.  
9.2.6 
Where projects are away from or unlikely to interact with any 
watercourses, it is likely that a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report 
will be scoped out. However, if NRW does require the inclusion of a WFD 
Report, it will be incorporated within the ES.  The requirement for a WFD 
Report will be confirmed with NRW once there is more certainty in the 
proposed layout and need for watercourse crossings. 
9.2.7 
This chapter provides a summary of existing baseline conditions with 
regards to water resources, flood risk and drainage, and assesses the 
potential impacts of the proposed works on water resources, flood risk 
and drainage.  The chapter also advises on recommended mitigation 
measures, if required, and summarises any likely residual effects. 
9.2.8 
The study area generally includes features within 1 km of the Project Site 
boundary. However, more distant features that may be hydraulically 
connected to the Project Site have also been considered. 
Significance Criteria 
9.2.9 
The methodology adopted for the assessment of effects of the Project 
on the water environment is detailed in Chapter 4.  Guidance for 
estimating importance of the attribute, magnitude of the impact and 
significance of the effects is provided in Table 9.1, Table 9.2 below and 
Table 4.3.

Limitations 
9.2.10 
The main limitations of the preliminary assessment are as follows: 
 
More detailed information required to confirm hydrogeological 
pathways and potential for pollutant transport. This preliminary 
assessment assumes a worst case scenario with potential for 
transport of pollutants through hydrogeological pathways. A ground 
investigation will be required to fully confirm hydrologeological 
pathways, which is unlikely to be completed for the ES. However, 
the assessment can be refined when more detailed information is 
available on the Project layout and location of potential pollutant 
sources; 
 
More detailed information required to assess the sensitivity of 
ecological receptors to changes in water quality. This preliminary 
assessment assumes ecological receptors may be sensitive to 
changes in water quality except where the designation indicates 
this is clearly not the case; and 
 
More detailed information required to assess specific impacts on 
flood risk and channel morphology where the Project may encroach 
on existing watercourses.  This will be addressed in the ES when 
there is greater detail available for the Project.

Consultation and Consultation Responses 
9.2.11 
Appendix 4.1 provides a summary of scoping responses and set out the 
actions that have been undertaken, or will be undertaken to address 
them. 
9.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Topography and Land Use 
9.3.2 
The Project Site is reasonably elevated and steeply sloping. Ground 
levels at the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m AOD in the 
north-west corner to 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter with ground 
levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction towards 
the Afon Llan and its tributaries.  
Ground conditions and hydrogeology 
9.3.3 
A full description of ground conditions and hydrogeology is provided in 
Chapter 10. A summary is provided here to understand the possible 
linkages with surface water features.  
9.3.4 
Review of British Geological Survey (BGS) online mapping data 
indicates that the Project Site is mostly underlain by bedrock of the 
Grovesend Formation, comprising mudstone, siltstone and sandstone 
although to the north and east of the Project Site, this may change to 
sandstone (Swansea Member formation). Superficial deposits across the 
Project Site are quite variable, however they largely comprise Till and 
Glaciofluvial deposits (sands and gravels) with a smaller area of Peat. 
The depth of superficial deposit is currently unknown.  
9.3.5 
Bedrock geology within the Project Site and study area is designated as 
Secondary A aquifer with superficial deposits including a mixture of 
Secondary A aquifer and unproductive strata. Secondary A aquifers are 
permeable layers capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather 
than strategic scale and, in some cases, can form an important source 
of base flow to rivers.  Unproductive strata are rock layers or drift 
deposits with low permeability that have negligible significance for water 
supply or river base flow. Soils in the study area are variable, designated 
to have high, intermediate and low leachate potential.  
9.3.6 
Groundwater movement within the underlying geology is likely to be 
limited considering the aquifer destinations as discussed above.  
Although the Project Site is elevated, shallow or perched groundwater 
within the superficial deposits is expected to be reasonably close to the 
surface and in hydraulic connectivity with the land drainage system 
located in this area.

9.3.7 
Groundwater quality in the study area has been assessed against the 
objectives of the WFD. According to the EA website the current 
quantitative quality is good and is predicted to remain so in 2015. The 
current chemical quality is poor and expected to remain so in 2015. 
Monitoring points are located in the vicinity of the study area (closest at 
Felindre) however records have not been obtained for this preliminary 
assessment.  There are no identified designated groundwater Source 
Protection Zones or drinking water Safeguard Zones with regards to 
agricultural activities within 1 km of the Project Site.  
9.3.8 
Seven licensed groundwater abstractions (bedrock aquifer) have been 
identified within 1 km of the Project Site for general farming and domestic 
uses.  
Contaminated land 
9.3.9 
A detailed assessment of contaminated land is included in Chapter 10. 
No desk-based study or intrusive site investigation has been completed 
to inform this assessment. However, as the majority of the Project Site 
is undeveloped it is unlikely to have experienced significant 
contamination.  Current or historic land uses that have a higher potential 
for ground contamination include the disused (inert) landfill and coal 
mine north of Abergelli Farm and the National Grid site towards the south 
west of the Project Site. 
Surface water features 
9.3.10 
Figure 9.1 shows the main surface water features in the vicinity of the 
Project Site considered in the preliminary assessment. The Loughor 
Estuary, alongside other ecological statutory designated sites, are 
shown on Figure 8.1. 
9.3.11 
The main watercourse that traverses the area is Afon Llan which flows 
in a south-westerly direction to the west and south of the Project Site, 
eventually discharging to the Loughor Estuary. This is a designated Main 
River, under the jurisdiction of NRW. The watercourse has been 
assessed under the WFD and Table 9.3 shows the current and 2015 
predicted status.  There are a number of smaller watercourses within the 
vicinity of the Project Site that drain to the Afon Llan, along with a number 
of springs and small ponds.

9.3.13 
With the possible exception of the northern boundary, the Project Site is 
outside of the Afon Lliw topographic catchment and therefore it is 
expected that any direct hydraulic connectivity will be limited. The Afon 
Llan does however join with the Afon Lliw approximately 9 km 
downstream of the Project Site. There may also be some potential for 
cross transfer of shallow groundwater flows between the two 
catchments.   
9.3.14 
Both the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw discharge to the Loughor Estuary west 
of Swansea, approximately 7 km from the Project Site. This has been 
assessed under the WFD as shown in Table 9.5. NRW has identified that 
the Loughor Estuary contains designated Shellfisheries.

1.6 km from the Project Site boundary, which serve the ponds/lakes 
close to Llwyncelyn.

Artificial water features (identified to date) 
9.3.16 
The Felindre water treatment works with covered reservoir is situated 
immediately north of the Project Site. A 48” diameter water main flows 
through the Power Generation Plant Site, in a south-easterly direction 
generally following the line of the existing access track. It is assumed 
that this is part of the water supply route serving Morriston to the south-
east.  
9.3.17 
The Lower Lliw reservoir is situated approximately 1.1 km north of the 
Project Site. The on-line reservoir is located in the adjacent Lliw 
catchment and is part of the water supply infrastructure in the area.  
Ecological designations 
9.3.18 
A detailed description of ecological designations within the study area is 
provided within Chapter 8.  A summary of features relevant to the 
assessment of impacts on the water environment is provided below.  
9.3.19 
The Loughor Estuary is located approximately 7 km west of the Project 
Site and receives water from the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw. It is designated 
as a SSSI with the Burry Inlet further downstream also a designated 
Ramsar site. Both form part of the Carmarthen Bay SAC. 
9.3.20 
Two SSSI sites are located closer to and potentially in hydraulic 
connectivity with the Project Site: the Nant y Crimp, approximately 2.2 
km west, designated for its wet pastures, grassland/woodland habitat 
and Marsh fritillary butterfly; and the Penllergaer railway cutting, 
approximately 3.5 km to the south-west designated for geological 
interest. The Project Site is not located within the catchment of the Nant 
y Crimp, and therefore hydraulic connectivity with the Project Site is 
limited to groundwater flows. An unnamed tributary of the Afon Llan flows 
through the Penllergaer SSSI however it is not considered that the 
Project will impact on its geological designation. Impacts to the SSSI are 
addressed in Chapter 8. 
9.3.21 
There are a number of SINCs situated within and surrounding the Project 
Site. It is understood that the main ecological value of these sites relates 
to marshy grassland/purple moor-grass and rush pastures, ponds and 
lowland mixed deciduous woodland. The SINCs may therefore have 
some sensitivity to changes in surface water runoff, flood risk or water 
quality but this is likely to be variable and will be assessed in greater 
detail for the ES.

Flood risk 
9.3.22 
Review of the Welsh Assembly Development Advice Map (DAM) 
indicates that a small area of the Project Site towards the Afon Llan lies 
within Flood Zone B (areas known to have flooded in the past evidenced 
by sedimentary deposits). Similarly land alongside the un-named drain 
east of the Project Site is situated within Flood Zone B and adjacent to 
Flood Zone C2 (see Figure 9.2). Comparison with the EA Flood Map for 
Planning (Rivers and Sea) indicates that the land within Flood Zone C2 
is located within the high risk Flood Zone 3.  Land within Flood Zone 3 is 
defined as land assessed as having a 1 in 100 or greater annual 
probability of river flooding (>1%).  
 
 Figure 9.2: Extract from Development Advice Map showing Flood 
Zone B (Yellow) and C2 (Blue) 
9.3.23 
Many of the drains flowing through the Project Site are not included in 
the DAM or EA Flood Map for Planning. However, review of the EA Risk 
of Flooding from Surface Water map indicates that land adjacent to these 
watercourses is at risk from pluvial and/or flooding from local 
watercourses. The mapping indicates two main flow routes through the 
Project Site, heading north to south towards the Afon Llan.  
9.3.24 
The lower lying parts of the Project Site may be susceptible to 
groundwater flooding from the shallow aquifers and natural springs in the 
area. BGS groundwater flooding susceptibility areas are located within

50 m of the Project Site and site observations confirmed the potential for 
groundwater emergence. It is likely that shallow groundwaters are in 
hydraulic connectivity with surface water features.   
9.3.25 
NRW undertook an assessment of areas at risk from a reservoir breach. 
The online risk map shows flooding extending the length of the Afon Lliw 
valley does not affect the Project Site. It is assumed this map covers 
scenarios of embankment breaches in the Upper and Lower Lliw 
Reservoirs, including breaches happening in cascade if applicable. This 
will be confirmed with NRW for the ES. 
9.3.26 
A burst of the watermain flowing through the Project Site is a potential 
source of flooding. Flow rates in the watermain will be confirmed with 
Welsh Water (Dwr Cymru) to further quantify the risks for the ES. 
9.3.27 
The flood risk maps included in the Swansea SFCA69 (2010) do not 
provide additional information to that described previously. No historic 
flood incidents are mapped within close proximity to the Project Site 
although as the study area is rural this does not necessarily imply no 
flooding has occurred.  
9.3.28 
The SFCA recommends that the LPA encourages the application of 
SUDS. The SFCA reports that infiltration measures are considered 
feasible to the north of Swansea based on underlying geology, however 
the SFCA acknowledges possible constraints on infiltration for example 
contamination risks and high groundwater table. 
Drainage 
9.3.29 
Detailed drainage plans have not been reviewed for this preliminary 
assessment. Conclusions have therefore been drawn from OS mapping 
and site observations.  
9.3.30 
The majority of the Project Site is undeveloped and it is reasonable to 
assume that surface runoff flows overland and through a network of field 
drains, eventually discharging to the Afon Llan.  There may be some 
piped networks and treatment of runoff (e.g. interceptors) associated 
with the existing farm operations. This will be confirmed, through a site 
survey, in the ES. 
9.3.31 
It is unlikely there are any existing foul sewers on the Project Site. 
Therefore, it is assumed that foul effluent from the farm and residential 
properties is discharged to local cess pits or septic tanks for subsequent 
removal.

Operation 
9.5.3 
It is assumed that ground levels along the route corridor of the Gas 
Connection will be very similar to existing and that any ongoing 
maintenance of the Gas Connection will be negligible. The impact of the 
Gas Connection during the operation phase is therefore considered to 
be limited to the presence of the trench if it has different hydraulic 
properties to the surrounding natural ground. This can be mitigated 
through careful selection and placing of bedding and backfill material to 
try and match the natural ground as far as possible. Transport of 
pollutants associated with previous land uses is addressed in Chapter 
10.  
9.5.4 
It is expected that offtake from the existing NTS will have a small footprint 
(two areas of approximately 90 m2) and the design will include 
appropriate SUDS measures for control and treatment of surface water 
runoff. No effluent discharges are expected for the Gas Connection. It is 
likely that the Gas Connection will be made from the north of the

Operation 
9.6.3 
This section considers the potential impacts that the Electrical 
Connection may have during its operation. It is assumed that ground 
levels along the route of the Electrical Connection will be very similar to 
existing and that any ongoing maintenance of the connection will be 
negligible. The impact of the Electrical Connection during the operation 
phase is therefore considered to be limited to the presence of the trench 
if it has different hydraulic properties to the surrounding natural ground. 
This can be mitigated through careful selection and placing of bedding 
and backfill material to try and match the natural ground as far as 
possible. Transport of pollutants associated with previous land uses is 
addressed in Chapter 10.  
9.6.4 
Effects during operation are unlikely to occur or be significant and 
therefore have been scoped out. 
9.7 
Project (as a whole) 
9.7.1 
The potential receptors are very similar for the Power Generation Plant, 
Gas and Electrical Connections as they cover very similar geographic 
areas. It is not expected that the presence of the other parts of the Project 
will reduce the effectiveness of measures to mitigate the impacts during 
construction. The impacts of the Gas and Electrical Connections during 
operation are expected to be negligible and therefore impacts relate only 
to the Plant Generation Site. The cumulative effects of the proposals for 
the Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections, therefore, 
are not expected to be significantly different from those identified for the 
individual parts of the Project detailed previously. 
9.8 
Cumulative Effects 
9.8.1 
Other developments to be considered for cumulative effects within the

significant cumulative effects on the water environment during

Summary and Conclusions 
9.9.1 
The potential significant impacts of the Project on water resources and 
flood risk have been identified and mitigation measures to reduce the 
effect identified where appropriate.  
9.9.2 
For the most part the Project is not anticipated to have any significant 
residual effects. In some instances the effect is currently assessed as 
moderate, and therefore potentially significant, due to the sensitivity of 
the receptor. However it is anticipated that the scale of impact may be 
reduced in the detailed assessment once more detailed information is 
available on the Project, mitigation measures and hydrogeological 
pathways.

GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY 
10.1 
Introduction 
10.1.1 
This chapter provides the geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology 
preliminary environmental assessement of the proposed Abergelli Power 
Project based upon assessment carried out up to September 2014.  The 
Project is described in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for the 
assessment carried out to date. The following factors have specifically 
been taken account of in this preliminary assessment    
10.1.2 
In respect of geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, the Project 
Scenario that is considered the realistic worst case from within the Power 
Generation Plant is described in Chapter 2. 
10.1.3 
Embedded mitigation will be included from the outset. Further details on 
embedded mitigation are detailed in Section 2.13.   
10.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
10.2.1 
The ground conditions assessment in the PEIR has taken account of 
planning policy and guidance set out in Section 3, as well as the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990. 
Assessment Methodology 
10.2.2 
Guidance contained within R&D Publication 66, EA/NHBC 200870, states 
that off-site features within an area of up to 250 m from the Project Site 
boundary should typically be considered within the hazard identification 
stage of the site assessment.  However, it is considered necessary 
(using professional judgement) to assess an area of up to 1 km from the 
Project Site boundary in which the development of the Project may 
impact on the highly sensitive receptors such as groundwater 
abstractions and source protection zones. 
10.2.3 
The baseline conditions (including the identification of previous land 
uses) described in this PEIR were determined with reference to the 
following: 
 
The GroundSure GeoInsight Report (geological conditions, hazards 
and mining hazards) (GS-1587648 29th July 2014), Appendix 10.1; 
 
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report (groundwater vulnerability, 
landfills and pollution incident records, and sensitive land uses

10.2.4 
In the specific case of assessing impacts from land contamination, a 
conceptual site model approach is used to assess the risks posed by 
contaminants to sensitive receptors using a “Source-Pathway-Receptor” 
model as outlined in CLR11 (EA & Defra, 2004)71; based on the 
following:  
 
Source – potential source of contamination; 
 
Pathway – means by which contamination can reach and 
impact upon a receptor; and  
 
Receptor – that aspect which may be adversely affected by the 
presence of contamination.   
10.2.5 
The assessment of risk is a three stage process commencing with a 
Preliminary Risk Assessment (usually completed after a Desk Study and 
Site Walkover) which comprises a qualitative assessment of the risk. 
This is typically followed by a ground investigation whereby the nature of 
the source is quantified and this can be used in a conservative Generic 
Quantitative Risk Assessment (GQRA). Where potentially unacceptable 
risks are identified, further investigation is typically required and the 
assessment becomes a Detailed Quantitative Risk Assessment (DQRA) 
requiring site specific modelling.

Site Walkover 
10.2.6 
A site walkover was undertaken on 18th July 2014.This was undertaken 
in order to identify potential sources of contamination, and potential 
receptors which may be adversely affected by the presence of 
contamination.   
Significance Criteria 
10.2.7 
The assessment of potential effects to geology and hydrogeology was 
undertaken using criteria set out in Tables 10.1 and 10.2 to define the 
importance/sensitivity of the receptor and the magnitude of change 
respectively. 
10.2.8 
Importance and magnitude are combined to determine the significance 
of each effect as presented in Table 4.3 in Chapter 4.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Current Land Use  
10.3.2 
The Project Site is predominately agricultural land, used for the grazing 
of horses and sheep with associated farm buildings and residential 
properties. No arable farming is understood to take place and as such it 
is anticipated that the agricultural land class is relatively low. 
10.3.3 
Industrial infrastructure across the Project Site includes a number of 
electricity pylons, Swansea North substation, gas compressor station 
and stack. 
10.3.4 
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report indicates National Grid Gas Plc 
currently operates a gas compressor station on the Project Site.  The 
associated integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) permit 
covers the process of combustion of any fuel of greater than or equal to 
50 MW. 
Historic Land Use 
10.3.5

period, comprising argillaceous mudstones and siltstones, with well-
developed coals, and minor lithic sandstones72.   
10.3.8 
The north eastern corner of the Project Site consists of the Swansea 
Member, also from the Westphalian stage, comprising green-grey 
pennant sandstone, with thin mudstone / siltstone and seat earth 
interbeds and mainly thin coals.  This geological formation is overlain 
conformably by the Grovesend Formation. 
10.3.9 
The permeability of the bedrock geology ranges from low to high, 
depending on the degree of fracturing.  There are nine faults across the 
Project Site, two of which have been observed, according to BGS 
records, and the others inferred either as a normal fault or along a coal 
seam. 
Superficial Geology 
10.3.10 
The superficial deposits located across the Project Site comprise 
predominantly glacial till (a diamicton; predominantly clay), and 
glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel. There are also pockets of 
alluvium and peat present locally within the Project Site boundary.  The 
peat is located north west of Abergelli Farm, and within the likely area for 
the Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area.  The permeability of 
the superficial deposits range from very low (within the clays) to very high 
(within the sand and gravel) across the Project Site. 
10.3.11 
There are records of three boreholes formed within the Project Site 
boundary held by the British Geological Survey (BGS); only one of these 
is currently available for viewing online73. The record has a reference of 
SN60SE24 and is located east of Abergelli Farm (NGR 265200, 
201600), in an area mapped as being underlain by Devensian 
glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel. 
10.3.12 
The superficial deposits recorded on the log comprise yellow brown 
gravelly clay to 6 metres below ground level (m bgl), overlying a grey 
brown clayey gravelly sand, clayey sand and sandy clay to 15.8 m bgl of 
likely glaciofluvial deposits that is underlain by firm yellow clay becoming 
stiff grey gravelly clay that is likely to be glacial till; proven to a maximum 
depth of 16.8 m bgl.  Traces of coal where identified at 10.7 m bgl within 
the clayey sand.

Soils and Agriculture 
10.3.13 
There are two different soil classification areas within the Project Site74. 
The predominant soil classification is described as slowly permeable, 
wet, very acidic upland soils with a peaty surface, of low fertility and 
moorland rough grazing and forestry land cover that drains to the stream 
network. Overgrazing could lead to accelerated run-off and soil erosion. 
10.3.14 
Through the centre and north eastern section of the Project Site, the soils 
are described as freely draining, slightly acid loamy soils, of low fertility, 
with arable and grassland land cover that drains to local groundwater 
and rivers.  There is potential for groundwater contamination associated 
with these soils, comprising nitrate, siltation and nutrient enrichment of 
streams from soil erosion.  
10.3.15 
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding the 
Project Site is grade 4 (poor quality agricultural land)75 with severe 
limitations which significantly restricts the range of crops and / or level of 
yields, mainly suited to grass with occasional arable crops76.  The Project 
Site is known to be utilised as improved grazing for sheep and horses, 
with small areas of marshy grassland and woodland copses 
interspersing the improved grassland to the north and east. The 
importance of this receptor is considered low. 
Ground Workings and Mineral Resources 
10.3.16 
According to the GroundSure GeoInsight Report, based on historical 
mapping there have been a number of historical surface ground working 
features on the Project Site.  These comprise refuse heaps, a colliery, 
old gravel pits and unspecified pits and a pond. 
10.3.17 
The GroundSure GeoInsight Report has identified a gravel pit at 
Abergelli Fach that produced sand and gravel. There are also a number 
of surface mineral workings, including sand and gravel, sand, sandstone 
and one underground deep coal working within 1km of the Project Site.  
All operations now have the “ceased” status. 
10.3.18 
The Project Site is not within an area of tin or clay mining, or brine or 
gypsum extraction.

Underground Coal Mining 
10.3.19 
A review of the GroundSure GeoInsight Report identified Abergelli 
Colliery located on the Project Site approximately 500 m north of 
Abergellii Farm operating between 1936 and 1948 that was 
subsequently indicated as disused on 1964 and 1975 historical mapping.  
However, the Coal Mining Report indicates the coal was last worked on 
the Project Site in 1986. A coal pit, shaft, colliery and tunnels have all 
been identified on historical mapping at locations between 480 m and 1 
km from the Project Site boundary (i.e. off-site), 
10.3.20 
Further details on Abergelli Colliery are presented in the Coal Authority 
Mining Report (Appendix 10.2) and are summarised below. 
10.3.21 
The Project Site is in the likely zone of influence from workings in three 
seams of coal, at shallow depth to a depth of 380 m.  The seams were 
last worked in 198677. 
10.3.22 
There are two mine entries on the Project Site, one of which is located in 
the vicinity of Abergelli Colliery (north of Abergelli Fach Farm). The other 
is located south of the National Grid site at (NGR 26498, 20078).  There 
is no record of any treatment to the mine entries. 
10.3.23 
The Project Site is currently not in an area for which the Coal Authority 
is determining to grant a licence to remove coal using underground 
methods, where a licence has been granted, or in an area that is likely 
to be affected at the surface from any planned future workings.  However, 
reserves of coal exist and could be worked in the future. 
Opencast Coal Mining 
10.3.24 
The Coal Authority report states that the Project Site is not within the 
boundary of an opencast site from which coal has been removed by 
opencast methods, and does not lie within 200 m of a boundary of an 
opencast site.  It also states that the Project Site is not within 800 m of 
the boundary of an opencast site for which the Coal Authority are 
determining whether to grant a licence to remove coal by opencast 
methods, or for which a licence to remove coal has been granted.

Abergelli Farm has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of 
the Coal Authority under its emergency surface hazard call out 
procedures. No further information was provided, however two damage 
notices or claims for alleged subsidence damage were made in June 
1995 and November 1996. 
10.3.27 
Geological hazards across the Project Site have been identified in the 
GroundSure GeoInsight Report; these are detailed in Table 10.4.

Radon Hazard 
The Project Site is in a Radon 
Affected Area, as between 3-5% 
of properties are above the Action 
Level. Radon protective measures 
may be necessary in the Project. 
 
10.3.28 
The high hazard associated with compressible ground is mapped and 
presented within the GroundSure GeoInsight Report and presumably 
associated with the peat. One of the high hazard areas is situated in the 
location of the Generating Equipment, along the eastern boundary, and 
the other to the west and north west of Abergelli Farm. 
10.3.29 
Consideration of this hazard will be made in the design of any ground 
works including site investigation, earthworks, de-watering and 
foundation design.  
Hydrogeology 
10.3.30 
The aquifer associated with the superficial geology comprises 
unproductive strata associated with the glacial till, and a Secondary A 
aquifer associated with the glaciofluvial deposits across the Project Site. 
The importance of this receptor is considered medium. 
10.3.31 
The bedrock geology aquifer has been classified as a Secondary A 
aquifer. The importance of this receptor is considered medium. 
10.3.32 
Unproductive strata are rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability 
that have negligible significance for water supply or river base flow.

Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
168 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
10.3.33 
Secondary A aquifers are permeable layers capable of supporting water 
supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in some cases forming 
an important source of base flow to rivers.  
10.3.34 
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report has identified one groundwater 
abstraction licence on the Project Site, associated with Abergelli Farm.  
The licence number is 22/59/4/0027 and is used for general farming and 
domestic purposes.  The version start date was 01/02/1993, as there is 
no end date, it has been assumed to be still active. The importance of 
this receptor is considered high. 
10.3.35 
There are an additional 16 No. groundwater abstraction licences within 
2 km of the Project Site all used for general farming and domestic 
purposes. 
10.3.36 
The Project Site does not lie within a groundwater Source Protection 
Zone (SPZ). Groundwater quality in the study area has been assessed 
against the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). 
According to the EA website the current quantitative quality is good and 
is predicted to remain so in 2015. The current chemical quality is poor 
and expected to remain so in 2015. 
10.3.37 
The closest potable water supply is from the Lower Lliw Reservoir 
approximately 1 km north west of the Project Site.  The original start date 
of abstraction was 09/08/1989. The importance of this receptor is 
considered high, however it is unlikely to be influenced by this Project. 
10.3.38 
Groundwater vulnerability has been identified from the GroundSure 
EnviroInsight Report with a varying classification across the Project Site, 
from low to high leaching potential. Low soil vulnerability is described as 
soils in which pollutants are unlikely to penetrate the soil layer because 
either water movement is largely horizontal, or they have the ability to 
attenuate diffuse pollutants. High soil vulnerability is described as coarse 
or moderately shallow soils which readily transmit non-adsorbed 
pollutants and liquid discharges but have some ability to attenuate 
adsorbed pollutants because of their clay or organic matter content78. 
10.3.39 
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report has identified there are areas 
susceptible to groundwater flooding within 50 m of the Project Site.  This 
is associated with superficial deposits, where shallow unconsolidated 
sedimentary aquifers overlie unproductive strata.  The susceptibility to 
groundwater flooding is potentially at the surface, which means that 
given the geological conditions in the area, groundwater flooding hazard

should be considered in all land-use planning decisions.  The BGS 
confidence rating of this groundwater flooding is classified as ‘high’67. 
Soil and Groundwater Quality 
10.3.40 
The GroundSure GeoInsight Report has identified the estimated 
background soil chemistry across the Project Site.  Estimated 
concentrations where identified are follows: 
 
Arsenic: 25 - 35mg/kg,  
 
Cadmium: <1.8mg/kg,  
 
Chromium: 60 - 90mg/kg 
 
Nickel: 15 - 30mg/kg; and 
 
Lead: <150mg/kg.  
10.3.41 
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report details historical landfill sites, and 
other waste management sites within 500 m of the Project Site. 
10.3.42 
Two historical landfills have been identified at Abergelli Fach Farm, the 
original landfill and the landfill extension, taking non-biodegradeable, 
inert waste.  The size of the landfills was greater than or equal to 75,000 
tonnes. The original landfill has a closed status, and the landfill extension 
now has an expired status.  The issue date for the licences was 
September 1999. There is no information regarding the closing date of 
the landfills. 
10.3.43 
There are also an additional three historical landfills within 400 m of the 
Project Site. Further details are provided in the GroundSure 
EnviroInsight Report. 
10.3.44 
There have been three discharge consents on the Project Site, all now 
expired or revoked: 
 
Discharging to land associated with Abergelli Farm in 1987; 
 
The National Grid site, discharging sewage to an unnamed land 
drain, effective between 2007 and 2010; and  
 
Trade discharges (site drainage) to the Afon Llan, revoked in 2011.  
10.3.45 
Further details of other discharge consents within 500 m of the Project 
Site boundary is presented in the GroundSure EnviroInsight Report. 
10.3.46 
There are five recorded pollution incidents within 500 m of the Project 
Site, three of which were on the Project Site.  Two are associated with 
atmospheric pollutants and effects (smoke) in 2002. The third incident 
concerned polluted soils and clay associated with inert materials and

wastes that occurred on 10/05/2007 in the north western corner of the 
Project Site, potentially associated with the construction works of the 
NTS.  This was classified as category 2, significant impact to the water 
environment, and category 3, minor impact to the land environment. 
Receptors 
10.3.47 
Receptors that have the potential to be impacted by the Project have 
been identified and are discussed above. The importance of receptors 
was classified in accordance with the criteria in Table 10.1 and are 
summarised below. 
10.3.48 
The geology and soils within the Project Site are preliminary assessed 
as being of medium sensitivity given the peat on the Project Site, 
unknown potential of sand, gravel and coal resources, however the 
agricultural land is classified as grade 4 (low sensitivity).   
10.3.49 
The groundwater is assessed as being of high importance, given that 
there is a groundwater abstraction licence on the Project Site used for 
general farming and domestic use. The bedrock aquifer and the 
glaciofluvial deposits are classified as a Secondary A aquifer. The glacial 
till deposits are classified as unproductive strata. This aquifer is 
assessed as having low importance. 
10.3.50 
There are four residential properties on the Project Site.  These residents 
are of high sensitivity.  Construction workers are classified as medium 
sensitivity as are only on site temporarily.

Power Generation Plant Assessment 
Construction/Decommissioning 
10.4.1 
The main effects on geology, soils and hydrogeology anticipated to occur 
during the construction and decommissioning phases of the Power 
Generation Plant, are presented in the table below. Effects during the 
decommissioning works will be temporary and therefore considered 
similar to those for the construction phase. For detail of the significance 
of impacts please refer to paragraph 4.6.3.

impacted from the construction/decommissioning phase through the 
disturbance of potentially contaminated ground and groundwater and 
also, if mine gas or mine water is disturbed through earthworks.  
However, it is considered through working in accordance with best 
practises this potential impact can be minimised.  The risks to human 
health will be refined by developing a conceptual site model within the 
Phase 1 desk study which will be appended to the ES. 
10.8 
Project (as a whole) 
10.8.1 
The summary of effects for the Project as a whole (including the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection) is detailed 
in Table 10.11.  In summary, when considering the effects of the Project 
as a whole, on the geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, the 
effects of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are 
comparatively minor.  Therefore, the effects of the Power Generation 
Plant are similar to that for the Project as a whole. 
10.9 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
10.9.1 
The planning application for the installation of ground mounted array of 
solar panels, inverter substations and 2.4 m high fencing around 
Abergelli Farm is located within the Project Site, within the Gas 
Connection area. It is not anticipated that this development will impact 
significantly on the geology and hydrogeology of the Project Site as it is 
understood there will be limited excavation works. The identified 
potential impacts on the geology and hydrogeology of the Project will 
comprise accidental pollution incidents during the construction phase. 
10.9.2 
It is not anticipated that the other planning applications for the Rhyd-y-
Pandy solar park, and Myle Coch Mawr wind turbines will have an impact 
on geology and hydrogeology such that a cumulative effect will occur 
alongside the Projects effects. 
10.9.3 
The development of the Project or other planned developments within 
the area are not anticipated to have any cumulative effects as they will 
not likely create a larger contamination or ground instability effect than 
the individual projects taken in isolation.  In addition, none of the planned 
developments will remove large amounts of good quality graded 
agricultural land or sites of important geology.

LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL IMPACTS 
11.1 
Introduction 
11.1.1 
This Chapter sets of the findings of preliminary the Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment (LVIA). It considers the likely significant effects 
arising during the construction, operation and decommissioning stages 
on landscape character and resources, designated landscapes, 
registered parks and gardens, and recreational interests; and visual 
amenity. 
11.1.2 
The assessment considers the Power Generation Plant, the Gas 
Connection and the Electrical Connections except for the Access Road 
Options, which have not been assessed further as there are no identified 
landscape and visual impacts arising as a result of utilising the existing 
trackways.  
11.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
11.2.1 
The LVIA has taken account of planning policy and guidance set out in 
Section 3, as well as the following documents: 
 
European Landscape Convention (ELC) 2007; and 
 
Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000. 
11.2.2 
The ELC recognises the importance of landscape and need for proper 
consideration of landscape and visual amenity within the planning 
system. The CRoW Act designated large areas of countryside as Open 
Access areas, where the freedom to roam was enshrined in legislation. 
This has resulted in the need to consider views from these areas of open 
access within landscape and visual impact assessments on a similar 
basis to PRoW. 
11.2.3 
The preliminary assessment has been carried out using current best 
practice and the methodology/guidance from the following sources: 
 
Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (GLVIA), 
3rd Edition, 2013, published by the Landscape Institute/Institute of 
Environmental Management and Assessment;  
 
LANDMAP Information Guidance Series, May 2013, Natural 
Resources Wales; and  
 
Advice Note 01/11: Photography and Photomontage in Landscape 
and Visual Impact Assessment, 2011, Landscape Institute.

Assessment Methodology 
Illustrative Tools 
11.2.4 
The following graphic information has been used to illustrate the visual 
aspects of the Project and will be provided with the ES. 
Visibility Maps  
11.2.5 
A computer generated Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) map has been 
produced for a stack height of 40 m (maximum height) to assist in 
viewpoint selection and to appreciate the extent to which the stacks will 
be seen from neighbouring areas (intervisibility). 
11.2.6 
The ZTV indicates areas from which it might be possible to secure views 
to part or parts of the Project.  
11.2.7 
The ZTV has been compiled using Ordnance Survey Landform Profile 
data comprising spot heights and of contours (within a 10 m resolution) 
to produce a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The DTM has been overlaid 
on a 1:250,000 Ordnance Survey base map to provide details of 
locations and landmark features, which may affect the extent of visibility 
or screening in the landscape. The model takes into account of the height 
of the stacks (worst case scenario of a 40 m stack height) and a radius 
of 15 km from the centre of the Project Site. A 15km radius has been 
selected as appropriate given the height of the proposed stacks and 
location within a valley with restricted visibility. 
Photographs  
11.2.8 
Panorama photograph and photomontage images will be produced to 
illustrate an observer’s view of the existing Project Site and Project 
during operation respectively, from each of the viewpoint locations. 
Discussions with CCS have identified potential photomontage viewpoints 
from key receptors. Photomontages will be created for a representative 
sample of the viewpoints assessed in the LVIA, sufficient to gain an 
appreciation of the likely visual effects and will be presented in the ES. 
NRW will also be consulted on the photomontages.   
11.2.9 
All photographs will be taken with a digital equivalent of a 35 mm SLR 
camera, with 50 mm focal length lens, mounted on a level panoramic 
head tripod. They will record a 90 degree angle of view to illustrate the 
full extent of the Project within the local landscape that will be 
experienced at each viewpoint. 
Wireframes

 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
187 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
11.2.10 
The Project will be shown from the selected viewpoints in wireframe 
format. Ordnance Survey Landform Profile data with a 50 m resolution 
will be used to construct the landform seen in the wireframe view. 
Proposed structures associated with the Project, other nearby built 
development or structures and viewpoint location coordinates will be 
added to the DTM as necessary. The wireframes will be constructed to 
show up to five stacks, each up to a height of 40 m.  The wireframe views 
will be taken from a set viewer height of 2 m above the terrain model (the 
terrain model has an accuracy of 3 m at grid points). 
Photomontages 
11.2.11 
Once the pre-prepared images have been imported and the wireframe 
views overlaid onto the photographs, photomontages of the proposed 
structures associated with the Project will be rendered (white) and 
blended using Adobe Photoshop software to produce a realistic view. 
Other large scale development not directly associated with the Project, 
such as the existing pylons, will be added to the DTM and the horizontal 
spacing and vertical dimensions of these structures matched when 
visible in the panorama. The images will be correctly scaled to the correct 
angle for the final output image size and transferred into CAD software 
to produce the images.  
Gathering Baseline Data 
11.2.12 
Baseline studies for assessing landscape and visual effects require a mix 
of desk study and field work to identify and record the character of the 
landscape and the elements, features and aesthetic and perceptual 
factors, which contribute to it.  
11.2.13 
The visual baseline establishes the area in which the Project may be 
visible, the different groups of people who may experience views of the 
Project, the places where they will be affected and the nature of the views 
and visual amenity at those points. Visual receptors are individuals and/ 
or defined groups of people who have the potential to be affected by a 
proposal such as the Project. 
11.2.14 
The use of Landscape Character Assessments is an important element 
of establishing the current baseline and potential forces for change. 
LANDMAP has been used for this assessment as it covers the necessary 
local area and evaluates each area in terms of its five key aspects, 
geological landscape, landscape habitats, historic landscape, cultural 
landscape, and visual and sensory landscape. 
11.2.15 
LANDMAP is the national information system for Wales, devised and 
managed by the NRW (as successor body to Countryside Council for 
Wales), for taking landscape into account in decision making. Landscape 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
characteristics within the vicinity of the Project Site are described with 
reference to what are termed, ‘Aspect’ data. The following five 
constituent Aspect data sets in LANDMAP are relevant for landscape 
and visual impact assessments:  
 
Visual & Sensory: identifies perceptual landscape qualities as well 
as including information on individual physical attributes of landform 
and land cover, and the relationships between them; 
 
Geological Landscape: identifies those landscape qualities which 
are linked to the control or influence exerted by bedrock, surface 
processes, landforms and hydrology; 
 
Landscape Habitats: Identifies the characteristics and spatial 
relationships of habitats and vegetation; 
 
Historic landscape: Identifies those qualities that depend on key 
historic land uses, patterns and features; and 
 
Cultural Landscape: includes information on the relationship 
between people and places, meaning of places to people, how 
landscape has shaped people’s actions and how people’s actions 
have shaped the landscape. 
11.2.16 
LANDMAP also includes evaluation scores, which are defined as follows: 
Table 11.1 LANDMAP Evaluation 
Overall evaluation score 
Corresponding definition of importance 
Outstanding 
International or national 
High 
Regional or county 
Moderate 
Local 
Low 
Little or no importance 
 
11.2.17 
The comparative landscape evaluations assigned to each Aspect area 
within the five data sets provides additional information to aid the 
assessment of the sensitivity of the landscape. Value does not 
necessarily equate with suitability or lack of suitability for a particular 
development and forms part of the underlying information from which the 
evaluation can be derived. 
11.2.18 
The greatest magnitude of change is likely to occur within Aspect areas 
that cover the Project Site. However, more distant Aspect areas where 
views form part of the area’s key characteristics, or to which the 
landscape of the Project Site serves as an important backdrop, may also 
be affected. Although this may normally be an issue for the Visual and 
Sensory layer, other qualities such as those in historical and cultural 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
189 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
landscapes may also be affected at some distance. These effects will be 
examined in the LVIA. 
Spatial Scope 
11.2.19 
The Study Area for visual effects has been set at 15 km for the ZTV and 
landscape character. Beyond 15 km it is considered that the nature of 
the location of the Project Site in a valley and the 40 m high stacks mean 
that effects are unlikely to be significant.  
Temporal Scope 
11.2.20 
More detailed Project Site studies will be undertaken to establish the 
landscape and visual baseline in the ES.  These will include site visits as 
well as desk based studies.  Landscape and visual impacts will be 
assessed 
for 
the 
construction 
phase, 
at 
operation, 
and 
at 
decommissioning. Visual impacts will be assessed for the winter (i.e. 
worst case) situation when the screening effects of vegetation are least 
effective. 
Significance Criteria 
Sensitivity 
11.2.21 
Sensitivity is a term applied to specific receptors, combining judgements 
of the susceptibility of the receptor to the specific type of change or 
development proposed and the value related to that receptor. The overall 
sensitivity of the landscape can be defined as embracing a combination 
of the sensitivity of the landscape resource (in terms of both its character 
as a whole and the individual elements contributing to character) and the 
visual sensitivity of the landscape.  
11.2.22 
Visual sensitivity is assessed in terms of a combination of factors such 
as views, visibility, the number and nature of people perceiving the 
landscape and the scope to mitigate visual impact. Sensitivity is not 
absolute; it will vary according to the character of the existing landscape 
and the extent and nature of the Project.   
11.2.23 
Visual receptors, such as users of buildings, recreational spaces, 
footpaths and transport routes, have differing sensitivities to their visual 
environment. Generally, this is subjective and dependent upon their 
interest in the visual environment, their viewing opportunity and duration, 
and the context of the views. These factors may be expressed in terms 
of: 
 The value of the view/viewpoint - reflects the intrinsic character and 
scenic qualities of its location and context. Where recognised through 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
190 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
the designation of an area, such as a National Park or National 
Scenic Area, value is increased, while the presence of detracting 
features in a view will generally reduce value. Higher value 
views/viewpoints are likely to be more sensitive to change. 
 The importance of the viewpoint – as indicated by some form of 
recognition, e.g. as noted in a guidebook, marked on the ground by 
a sign or other visible feature. The provision of facilities e.g. seating, 
parking, footpath may also indicate a location of higher importance. 
Views gained from locations where people gather outdoors may also 
be of higher importance. 
11.2.24 
Table 11.2 Landscape Sensitivity and Table 11.3 Visual Sensitivity 
(below) describe differing degrees of sensitivity ranging between low to 
high. LANDMAP provides information on landscape value for an area, 
which is one element of sensitivity. The determination of the sensitivity 
of the landscape resource is based upon an evaluation of each key 
element or characteristic of the landscape. The evaluation will reflect 
such factors as its quality, value, contribution to landscape character, 
and the degree to which the particular element or characteristic can be 
replaced or substituted. The tables are then used to identify sensitivity 
for a specific receptor within the LANDMAP Area. Each of the bullet 
points in Table 11.2 and 11.3 must be fulfilled under each category of 
sensitivity.

physical, cultural or historic interest, beauty spots and picnic 
areas; and 
 Large number of viewers and/or location in highly valued 
landscape could elevate viewer sensitivity to highest level. 
Medium 
 Viewers with moderate interest in their environment, and 
discontinuous and/or irregular viewing periods. Such receptors 
will include: 
 Road or rail users; 
 Users engaged in outdoor sport or recreation other than 
appreciation of the landscape (i.e., hunting, shooting, golf, 
water-based activities); and  
 Users of secondary footpaths or footpaths that may be already 
impacted by intrusive features. 
Low 
 Small number or low sensitivity of viewers assumed. 
 Viewers with a passing interest in their surroundings and 
momentary viewing periods.  Such receptors include: 
 Drivers/travellers and/or passengers of moving vehicles 
including trains; and  
 People at their place of work, including agricultural workers and 
other non-motorised users on most roads or those already 
impacted by intrusive features.

Magnitude 
11.2.25 
Each effect on a receptor needs to be assessed in terms of its size or 
scale, the geographical extent of the area influenced, and its duration 
and reversibility. The assessment will consider the magnitude of change 
the Project will exert on the receptor because of:  
 
The proximity of the Project to the receptor – generally the 
magnitude of effect reduces with increasing distance as it 
progressively exerts less influence; 
 
The extent to which the Project can be seen, and the extent to 
which landform, woodland, buildings etc. intervene; and 
 
The visibility of the Project and its resulting effects on character. 
11.2.26 
The assessment of the magnitude of potential visual impacts is an 
assessment of the extent of change upon visual amenity as a direct result 
of the Project, and depends upon several factors including: 
 
The scale of change in the view with respect to the loss and/or 
addition of new features; 
 
The degree of contrast, or integration of/compatibility with any new 
features with existing features in the view; 
 
The duration of the effect (temporary or permanent, intermittent or 
continuous).  Temporary effects are considered to be less 
significant than longer term or permanent effects; 
 
The distance of the receptor from the source of the effect; 
 
The angle of view and presence of intervening vegetation or 
features; 
 
The dominance of the impact feature in the view, and 
 
Seasonal variation.  
11.2.27 
It is assumed that the visual effects of the Project will reduce as viewing 
distance increases.  The magnitude of visual effects at any given 
distance will vary according to a range of factors.  They include:  
 
The extent of the new buildings and structures that will be visible;  
 
Their position in the view;

 
The presence of other conspicuous features;  
 
The extent to which views of the Project will be screened or filtered 
by intervening landform or by landscape elements such as trees, 
woodlands, hedgerows, or built structures; and  
 
The extent of mitigation planting. 
11.2.28 
The assessment will assume that the change will be seen in clear 
visibility and under appropriate lighting conditions and considers: 
 
The attributes of the landscape where the Project will be sited (i.e. 
the scale and character of the landscape in which it will be viewed; 
the presence or absence of landscape features; and the 
scale/enclosure of the landscape within the field of view); 
 
The design and siting of the Project itself; and 
 
The atmospheric conditions prevalent at the time of viewing. 
11.2.29 
Criteria used to assess the magnitude of predicted landscape and visual 
amenity effects range from no change/negligible to major and are set out 
below in Table 11.4.

Significance of Effect 
11.2.30 
The two principal criteria determining significance are the sensitivity of 
the receptor to change as a result of the Project, and the magnitude of 
the effect.  In order to come to an overall conclusion on the significance 
of landscape and visual effects, the separate judgements about the 
sensitivity of the landscape receptors and the magnitude of the 
landscape impacts are combined as shown in Table 4.3. 
11.2.31 
Judgements on the overall significance of effect need to be determined 
using informed and well-reasoned professional judgement. To help guide 
the judgements the scale of significance and associated descriptions 
provided in Table 11.5 will be used in the assessment. 
Table 11.5: Significance of Effects

Limitations 
11.2.32 
The use of ZTV mapping needs to be qualified on the following basis: 
 There are a number of areas within the ZTV maps from where there 
is potential to view parts of the Project, but which comprise land to 
which the general public do not have access; 
 A ZTV map does not account for the effects of screening and filtering 
of views as a result of intervening features, such as buildings, trees 
and hedgerows; and 
 A ZTV map does not account for the likely orientation of a viewer – 
for example when travelling in a vehicle. 
11.2.33 
The combined effect of these limitations means that ZTV mapping tends 
to over-estimate the extent of visibility – both in terms of the land area 
Abergelli Power Project

196 
Parsons Brinckerhoff

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
from which the Project is visible and the extent of visibility of the Project’s 
structures from a particular viewpoint. 
11.2.34 
This is consistent with the overall approach taken to assess the realistic 
worst case scenario and, although the use of this type of ZTV map is 
considered good practice, a ZTV map does not present an absolute 
measure of visibility or the ‘visual impact’ of the Project. 
Consultation and Consultation Responses 
11.2.35 
Appendix 4.1 provides a summary of scoping responses and set out the 
actions that have been undertaken, or will be undertaken to address 
them. 
11.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Site Context 
11.3.2 
The Project Site is located within a patchwork of woodland and pasture 
with visually prominent utility-based infrastructure in the area. Gas and 
water pipelines cross the Project Site and there is also a network of 
electricity pylons southwest of Abergelli Farm. Furthermore, there is a 
Gas Compressor Station and Water Treatment Works located 
immediately to the northwest, and Cefn Betingau Solar Park to the east 
of the Project Site.  
11.3.3 
The nearest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is the Gower 
AONB which is physically remote from the Project Site being 10 km away 
and visually separated from the Project Site by intervening topography. 
The Brecon Beacons National Park lies over 15 km to the north of the 
Project Site and due to the intervening distance is both physically and 
visually separate. Both protected landscapes have been scoped out of 
the assessment due to the physical and visual separation. However, both 
are noted within the baseline and two viewpoints have been located 
within the Gower AONB in order to support the overall assessment. 
Land Use and Vegetation 
11.3.4 
Pastoral land use is predominant within the wider valley, combined with 
forestry to the south west featuring Penllergaer Forest and other smaller 
scattered broadleaved woodlands, typically scattered throughout the 
valley. 
11.3.5 
A block of broadleaved woodland is located to the east and is classified 
as Ancient Woodland and a SINC. There are also further large blocks of 
woodland to the west, which are also SINCs.

11.3.6 
Fields are medium to small and irregularly shaped, divided by 
combinations of hedge banks, low walls, and ditches. With the exception 
of the road side; hedgerows are generally unmanaged, overgrown and 
contain frequent hedgerow trees. 
11.3.7 
Land within the valley is of poor agricultural value (see Chapter 10) and 
is, poorly draining (see Chapter 9).  
11.3.8 
Other significant land uses within the study area include the following: 
 National Grid Site at Waun Ffyrdd to the west of the Project Site and 
its associated overhead power lines and pylons are frequent and 
dominant features within the valley; 
 Large water treatment works at Waun y Garn-wen, 1 km north of the 
Project Site; 
 Park & Ride at Brynwhilhach, just north of Junction 46 to the south 
west of the Project Site; 
 Morriston Hospital complex at Pant Iasau to the south of the Project 
Site; 
 M4 and rail transport corridor to the north of Junction 46 to the south 
of the Project Site; and 
 Northern edges of Swansea, forming dominant features in the 
southern and south eastern parts of the study area.  
11.3.9 
The combination of undulating land form, woodlands, plantations, 
hedgerows and hedgerow trees combine to give the valley a well 
vegetated character. This character of woodland, rolling topography and 
visual containment helps integrate developments into the rural fabric. 
Landform  
11.3.10 
The Project Site lies centrally within the Afon Llan Valley; that forms a 
wide lowland basin situated at the base of higher ground and steep 
valleys to the north and east. The valley floor is wide and undulating; 
backed to the north by upland moorland areas rising to over 250 m AOD 
and divided by numerous steep narrow valleys. 
Settlement 
11.3.11 
North of the M4 and Swansea, settlements are typically small, dispersed 
villages and scattered farmsteads. Felindre is the largest village, situated 
1km north-west of the Project Site and nestling within the Upper Lliw 
Valley.

11.3.12 
Properties are a mixture of styles with older properties circa 17-18th 
Century typically stone and white washed walls with slate roofs. 
Public Rights of Way & Recreation 
11.3.13 
The study area is well served by PRoW (see Figure 12.4), though not all 
are easily accessible or regularly used. PRoW leading to outlying 
properties often combine as local farm tracks, notably PRoW LC35 and 
to the north, a diverted section of LC35.  
11.3.14 
The Gower Way long distance footpath passes approximately 2-3 km to 
the north of the Project Site along the Afon Llw valley and reservoirs. 
11.3.15 
St Illtyd’s Walk long distance footpath passes approximately 7-8 km to 
the north along the ridge line that takes in Craig Fawr, Pentwyn Mawr, 
and Penlle’r Castell. 
Landscape Character 
11.3.16 
The baseline study includes an appraisal of the landscape within 15 km. 
Information has been gathered through a combination of desk studies 
and field survey. 
11.3.17 
The Project Site is situated in the low lying parts of the Afon Llan Valley 
and consists of very gently sloping land, falling south-south-east. The 
land consists of grazing fields divided in parts by hedgerows with 
occasional trees or fencing. The Project Site has a sense of visual 
enclosure provided by rising ground to the north and north west and from 
existing hedgerows and vegetation associated with the eastern boundary 
stream, woodland to the immediate south of the Project Site and wetland 
vegetation within the valley to the north east.  
11.3.18 
Borrowed distant views out towards upland areas at Mynydd Gelliwastad 
in the east and Banc Maestir-mawr in the north, also adds to the sense 
of place. However, the wide tarmaced track leading to Abergelli Farm 
(previously used as access to former land fill site north west of Abergelli 
Farm) and wide farm tracks surrounding the eastern Project Site, and the 
close presence of overhead power lines and pylons within the valley, 
creates detractors within the landscape and partly reduces the sense of 
remoteness. 
11.3.19 
The Project Site lies within two LANDMAP landscape character areas, 
Rhyd-y-Pandy and Penllergaer Forest. Descriptions of these and other 
adjacent character areas are summarised below (Refer to Figure 11.3 – 
Landscape Character Areas).

11.3.20 
This area (to the east of the Project Site) is described as rolling farmland 
mosaic on land ranging between 60 m and 200 m AOD, with slight upland 
character at these higher elevations generated by the adjacent uplands, 
essentially rural landscape, although criss-crossed by a network of minor 
roads and greater detractor of overhead wires on steel pylons. The 
southern part of this area is also influenced by road noise from the busy 
M4. 
11.3.21 
The sensitivity of this character area to change is considered to be 
medium. This reflects the rural nature of the landscape and the open, 
medium to long distance views that are possible over the surrounding 
landscape, but also acknowledges the presence of numerous detractors 
in the landscape. The high voltage towers associated with electricity 
transmission form a prominent element, as does the M4 motorway and 
developments on the northern edge of Swansea.  
11.3.22 
LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
moderate value. 
Penllergaer Forest 
11.3.23 
This landscape character area (to the west of the Project Site) is 
relatively low lying and is described as rolling farmland dominated by 
conifer woodland. Land cover is dominated by conifer plantation and 
where woodland is interrupted, agriculture is present, with fields set to 
pasture and small to medium sized field compartments. The woodland, 
together with the nature of the landform, provides a strong degree of 
enclosure and shelter. 
11.3.24 
The sensitivity of this character area to change is considered to be low, 
increasing to medium where the landcover opens up. This is primarily a 
result of the degree of visual enclosure provided by the woodland and 
the limited contribution made by views out from the character area. 
11.3.25 
LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
moderate value. 
Other Landscape Character Areas 
Pentwyn Mawr 
11.3.26 
This landscape character area (to the north east of the Project Site) is 
described as having strongly rolling hills of between 250 m and 400 m 
AOD. Land cover is predominantly rough grazing moorland with a 
distinctive upland feel generated by exposure, elevated views, a lack of 
human presence and detractors. Attractive long views of the Gower add 
to a sense of place.

11.3.27 
The sensitivity of this character area to change is considered to be high 
given its generally intact upland character and sense of place and 
accessible picturesque and borrowed views. 
11.3.28 
The LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
high value. 
Mynydd Gelliwastad 
11.3.29 
This landscape character area (to the east of the Project Site) is 
described as upland grazing land. The area is open with views out to 
Clydach and is distinct from surrounding areas, which have a more 
pasture/hedgebank characteristic.  
11.3.30 
The sensitivity of the landscape character area to change is considered 
to be high. This reflects the open nature of land and long distance views 
available from this area. 
11.3.31 
The LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
moderate value. 
West of Clas 
11.3.32 
This landscape character area (to the south of the Project Site) is 
described as rolling farmland on relatively low lying land, with mosaic 
pattern derived from hedges and scattered woodland, mainly broadleaf. 
Urban influence is strong in the southern and eastern sides, where the 
area is encircled by the urban edge. The northern edge borders the M4 
motorway. 
11.3.33 
The sensitivity of this character area to change is considered to be 
medium; reflected by the urban/built influences on the area.  
11.3.34 
The LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
moderate value. 
Settlement 
11.3.35 
Several areas of settlement lie within the study area (see Figure 1.1). 
Within these areas there is a high degree of enclosure provided by built 
development and vegetation which restricts the views over the 
surrounding landscape. However, it is possible that the elevation of the 
land in certain places affords long distance views, particularly in 
Llangyfelach. Land cover is dominated by residential uses, but there are 
industrial, commercial and office premises in some areas. The Driver and 
Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the tallest building in the vicinity and 
forms a dominant presence, both within the built up area and when 
viewed from the surrounding rural landscape.

11.3.37 
The LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
low value. 
Wider Study Area 
11.3.38 
A number of other LANDMAP landscape character areas have been 
identified that lie within the wider study area. These areas are as follows: 
 Penbwl Valley, Graig-neddfwch Woods; 
 Cwm Clydach; 
 North of Clydach; 
 Afon Tawe; 
 Afon Lliw and surrounds; and 
 Surrounding Cwm Dulais. 
11.3.39 
These have not been considered due to the distance from and/or lack of 
intervisibility with the Project Site.  
11.3.40 
LANDMAP also identifies the M4 Corridor as a landscape character 
area, comprising a large road corridor with associated signage, lighting, 
embankments, cuttings and overbridges. Noise and movement are major 
detractors. [The area is considered to have minimal landscape value.  
The LANDMAP overall evaluation of landscape character for this area is 
Low value.] 
Visual Receptors 
11.3.41 
Residential receptors within 1 km of the Project Site include those within 
the nearby settlements of Morriston, Pant-lasau and Llwyncelyn and 
Felindre. The closest residential dwellings to the Project Site are 
Abergelli Farm, Cefn-betingau to the west and Maes-eglwys to the 
southwest. In addition there are also isolated dwellings and farmsteads 
outside of the settlements including but not exclusive to:  
 
Abergelli Farm; 


11.3.42 
The potential visual amenity effects arising from the Project have been 
considered throughout the study area. A preliminary survey was carried 
out to identify useful viewpoints to propose for the impact assessment. A 
wide variety of locations were initially selected as they offered a potential 
range of appropriate receptors, provided good coverage of the local area 
and seemed likely to provide views of the Project Site. However, once 
out on site it was clear that much of the Project Site is not visible or only 
partially visible from many of the potential receptors. In particular, views 
from nearby properties in the valley are obscured by topography and/or 
vegetation.  
11.3.43 
Although properties on the edge of Morriston (northern suburbs of 
Swansea) are on the rising ground overlooking the Project Site, there are 
few public vantage points from where views can be confirmed and/ or 
assessed.

Power Generation Plant Assessment 
11.4.1 
The construction and commissioning of the Power Generation Plant will 
include all areas required for the permanent works as well as temporary 
construction areas. During this time potential adverse temporary 
landscape and visual effects will arise from the following activities: 
 
Site clearance, removal of vegetation and topsoil stripping from the 
Project Site;  
 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
 
Construction of an internal road for access to the buildings and 
storage area; 
 
Movement of construction related traffic including delivery and 
removal of materials to and from site, off-site road traffic including 
workers travelling to and from site; 
 
General construction activities including the movement of large scale 
construction equipment, i.e. tower cranes, smaller cranes, batching 
plants drilling rigs; site compounds and temporary buildings required 
for construction and parking on site materials stockpiles; presence 
of temporary hoardings and protective fencing; temporary hoardings 
and protective fencing; and signage;  
 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months;  


For visual amenity considerations a maximum stack height of 40 m has 
been used for each of a maximum of five stacks. This is considered the 
worst case scenario. Table 11.8 provides the initial assessment of the 
impacts of the Power Generation Plant during operation with and without 
mitigation. Where potential residual effects are stated, this sets out what 
might be the effect once the site is operational and any landscape 
scheme has had 15 years to mature.

important. There maybe some remaining residual effects arising from 
vegetation loss as a result of clearance work prior to construction. 
11.7.2 
During operation there will be some significant effects where the Project 
is visible, in particular from southern receptor points. Route identification, 
reinstatement of underground infrastructure, screening of above ground 
infrastructure will be important in mitigating these effects, reducing the 
potential for residual effects. 
11.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
11.8.1 
Construction and decommissioning effects will be determined by the 
proposed site works programmes. Construction of the Mynydd y Gwair 
Wind Farm will be 3km north of the Project Site and although a proposed 
access route to the wind turbine site is along the Craig y Bedw ridge, it 
is unlikely to be noticeable in and around or in combination with the 
Project Site.  
11.8.2 
The Felindre Business Park is currently under construction and is 
therefore likely to be complete before the construction of the Project 
commences (other than minor works).  
11.8.3 
The solar park is at planning application stage and it is feasible that it 
maybe be underway on site at the same time as the Project. Although 
some cumulative effects can be expected, for most receptors there will 
be no effect as intervisibility with the Project Site at ground level (where 
most of the construction activities will be taking place) is limited. 
Operation 
11.8.4 
The area identified for the Mynydd y Gwair Wind Farm is not within the 
Zone of Visual Influence for the Project. Preliminary viewpoint pVP6 is 
located on the northern side of the wind farm and as it is expected that 
the Project Site will be out of view from this location, there will be no 
cumulative effects from viewpoints in the north. Views from the south 
looking northwards to the Project Site will have the wind farm as a 
backdrop. The addition of the stacks associated with the Project will 
increase the amount of utility infrastructure in the view. However, these 
are different types of vertical structures (stacks/wind turbine) and will be 
perceived as different types of development in the landscape. It is 
expected that there will be some cumulative visual effects on viewpoints 
south of the Project Site. 
11.8.5 
Felindre Business Park is currently under construction with the main 
infrastructure works being implemented on the ground in order to 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
214

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
facilitate development of the individual plots. The Felindre sustainable 
urban village is also planned to link in with the business park. The Project 
will be located to the north east of these sites and is visually contained 
within its woodland context. It sits within an existing landscape of pylons, 
wires and substations. Views from pVP1 and pVP11 will afford broad 
views north of the Business Park and the proposed urban village. The 
Project will be seen as an addition to the existing substations and 
electrical infrastructure in the area, rather than an integral part of the 
Business Park & Village. Any cumulative visual effects are not likely to 
be significant due to the differing nature of the developments and the 
existing character of the area.  
11.8.6 
The Solar Park at Brynwhilach Farm is adjacent to the southern 
boundary of the Project. The area is wooded and contained visually and 
therefore, despite the size of the proposed solar park, it is unlikely that it 
will be visible from the majority of receptors to the north, east and west. 
For receptors to the south, notably pVP1 and pVP11 it is likely that the 
solar panels will be fully or partially visible and seen in combination with 
the Project. Although the characteristics of the two developments are 
different, any cumulative visual effects are likely to be significant from the 
south. 
11.9 
Summary and Conclusions 
11.9.1 
The expectation is that the main visually prominent element of the Project 
will be the up to 40 m high stacks. These vertical elements are expected 
to have adverse effects on some medium distance receptors. However, 
much of the Project Site itself will be screened by existing vegetation and 
local topography and this will reduce the visual effects of the main 
generators. This could be strengthened with planting as part of a 
landscape mitigation strategy. The Gas and Electrical Connections are 
predominantly underground and are not expected to have significant 
effects other than where there is above ground infrastructure.

TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
12.1 
Introduction 
12.1.1 
This chapter provides the traffic, transport and access preliminary 
environmental assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power Project 
based upon assessment carried out up to September 2014. The 
proposed development is set out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary 
basis for the assessment carried out to date.  
12.1.2 
The following factors have specifically been taken account of in this 
preliminary assessment: a Power Generation Plant capable of 
generating ~299MW, a Gas Connection, and an Electrical Connection. 
The worst case considers a plant with up to 5 generators and stacks as 
this is likely to generate the greatest level of traffic during construction. 
12.1.3 
Embedded mitigation included within the assessment of traffic, transport 
and access consists of a Construction Traffic Management Plan, and 
Travel Plan for construction and operational workers (see Chapter 2). 
These documents aim to mitigate the impact of vehicular trips on the 
local road network.  
12.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
12.2.1 
The traffic assessment in the PEIR has taken account of planning policy 
and guidance set out in Section 3, as well as the following documents: 
 
Wales Transport Strategy (2008);  
 
Wales Infrastructure Investment Plan (May 2012); and 
 
Regional Transport Plan for South West Wales (2010-2015). 
12.2.2 
The likely significant effects of the Project in environmental terms will be 
evaluated 
in accordance 
with 
the 
Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Assessment’s (IEA) ‘Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of 
Road Traffic’ (1993). 
Assessment Methodology 
12.2.3 
A meeting was held with the CCS and the South Wales Trunk Road 
Agent in Swansea on 7th August 2014 in order to discuss the Project with 
these Authorities and the potential impacts of the Project and the 
available data sources to assist with the assessment. 
12.2.4 
The preliminary assessment has established the existing capacity 
conditions around the Project Site and assessed network and corridor 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
performance in relation to a number of receptors. This is based on data 
collected on site and existing data.  
12.2.5 
In addition, the ES Chapter will present the findings of trip estimates from 
the Project, the mode split of all trips, and the likely distribution across 
the transport network. Forecasting of baseline traffic data will be carried 
out to establish a ‘do minimum’ scenario for a future year.  
12.2.6 
The impact of the Project will be established by adding trips associated 
with the Project to the ‘do minimum’ scenario to create a ‘do something’ 
scenario and the effects will be presented in the ES Chapter. The 
cumulative effects of all other development will also be assessed. If 
necessary, mitigation measures will be proposed to reduce the number 
of trips, or provide capacity to cater for these additional trips.  
12.2.7 
A Travel Plan will be created and adopted in which sustainable transport 
will be promoted throughout the life cycle of the Project. 
12.2.8 
Additionally, an outline Construction Traffic Management Plan will be 
produced as a basis to manage the traffic associated with the 
construction phase of the Project. 
12.2.9 
Potential environmental effects are likely to be most significant for 
receptors within the local community, and employees at the Project, 
although any user of the highway network or of the local public rights of 
way around the Project could be affected.  
12.2.10 
The Project may cause potential effects to both motorised and non-
motorised users and it will be ensured that effects for all modes of 
transport are considered and kept to a minimum.  
12.2.11 
As further work is progressed, the transport related environmental effects 
(as defined by IEA guidelines) are being assessed for the following 
factors:  
 Traffic flows; 
 Delay; 
 Road safety; 
 Intimidation and fear; 
 Severance; and 
 Pedestrian amenity. 
12.2.12 
The effects of traffic in relation to noise and vibration, and air quality are 
considered in the relevant sections of the PEIR.  
Traffic Flows  
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
219 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
12.2.13 
The changes in traffic flow will be assessed in terms of impacts on key 
junctions and links surrounding the project site. These locations are 
awaiting agreement from SCC but are likely to include: 
 M4 Junction 46 northern dumbbell; 
 M4 Junction 46 southern dumbbell; 
 A48 / Pant Lasau Road mini roundabout; 
 Pant-Lasau Road / Mynydd Gelli Wastad Road / Heol Maes Eglwys 
mini roundabout; 
 B4489 to Felindre; 
 Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road; and 
 Unnamed Road north of Abergelli Fach Farm. 
12.2.14 
The impact of flow changes at these locations will be assessed for the 
traffic related to the construction/decommissioning phase or the 
operational phase, whichever is greater. 
12.2.15 
It is estimated that the construction and decommissioning phases will 
result in approximately 200 car or van trips per day and around 150 HGV 
deliveries per day during the peak construction/decommissioning period. 
This assumes a 22 month construction period, as per smiliar peaking 
plants, with the peak of HGV deliveries occurring during the first quarter 
of construction (months 1 to 3) and the peak of car and van trips occuring 
during the fifth quarter of construction (months 13 to 15). The car or van 
trips would be limited to the start and end of the working day whilst HGV 
trips would be spread across the day.  
12.2.16 
During the operational period, it is antipicated that approximately 3 
people would be present on site during each shift. With three shifts per 
day, this would equate to 18 two-way car trips.  
12.2.17 
The construction/decommissioning phase has the largest impact in 
terms of traffic generation and the impacts of this scenario on the 
surrounding road network will be assessed in the ES.  
12.2.18 
The junctions will be assessed for: 
 a base year (2014); 
 a do minimum scenario to reprent baseline levels of traffic during 
the peak construction period (year dependent on construction 
timetable); and 
 a do something scenario to represent the impact of the construction 
traffic over and above the do minimum.

 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
220 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
12.2.19 
The do something scenario will assess the construction worker traffic 
and HGV deliveries arriving at and departing from the site for each of the 
componets of the project; the Electrical Connection, the Gas Connection, 
and the Power Generation Plant.  
12.2.20 
Traffic surveys are in the process of being commissioned to determine 
the peak hours for assessment. From initial investigations, traffic 
generated by the Project is likely to have a greater impact on Access 
Option 1, as this route, from the M4 Junction 46 to Pant-Lasau, is an 
important route enabling access to Morriston Hospital and is used by 
emergency service vehicles. 
Delay  
12.2.21 
The change in delay resulting from the change in traffic flow will be 
presented in the ES and the percentage increase reported. The change 
in delay will be assessed through the assessment of delay at key 
junctions in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
Road Safety  
12.2.22 
An analysis of collisions over a five-year period will be undertaken in the 
ES to identify any significant patterns or clusters in the vicinity of the 
project site. The collision history at each of the junctions identified for 
traffic assessment will be reported in the ES. 
Intimidation and Fear  
12.2.23 
Intimidation and fear can be caused by location, highway layout, level of 
crime, and driver stress. As discussed in the IEA guidelines, there are no 
commonly agreed thresholds for estimating these from other measurable 
factors.  
12.2.24 
Therefore a qualitative judgement, based on content of the ES Chapter 
including a site audit and non-motorised user assessment will be used 
to determine the intimidation and fear effect of the Project.  
Severance  
12.2.25 
Severance will be assessed in the ES in relation to the increase in traffic 
flow. A qualitative assessment will be provided based on traffic volumes, 
and impacts on footways and PRoW. 
Pedestrian Amenity  
12.2.26 
Pedestrian Amenity is defined within the IEA guidelines as the “relative 
pleasantness of a journey”. This is affected by traffic flow, traffic 
composition, pavement width and separation from traffic.  
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
221 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
12.2.27 
There are no commonly agreed thresholds for quantifying the 
significance of changes in pedestrian amenity, although in this case the 
traffic flow will be assessed for the increase in the proportion of HGVs. If 
the proportion of HGVs double, a significant effect is likely to arise. A 
qualitative assessment of the effect of the Project on pedestrian amenity 
will then be given using the Site Audit and Non-Motorised User 
Assessment. 
12.2.28 
A preliminary assessment of the likely impacts listed above for each of 
the elements of the Project and each Project phase is presented in 
Section 12.4 to 12.6 below. 
Significance Criteria 
12.2.29 
IEA provides guidance on how the magnitude of changes in traffic flow 
should be determined, as shown in Table 12.1   
Table 12.1: Criteria Defining Magnitude of Change in Traffic Flow 
Magnitude 
Criteria 
High 
Considerable change in condition (90+%) 
Medium 
Readily apparent change in conditions (60-90%) 
Low 
Perceptible change in conditions (30-60%) 
Very Low 
No discernible change in conditions (0-30%) 
 
12.2.30 
The overall significance of change is categorised based on the sensitivity 
of the receptor as shown in Table 4.3. For many effects, there are no 
simple rules or formulae which define thresholds of significance and 
there is, therefore, a need for interpretation and judgement on part of the 
assessor, backed-up by data or quantified information wherever 
possible. Consultation with stakeholders will enable determination of the 
sensitivity of each receptor.  
12.2.31 
The positive or negative effect of changes may therefore vary across 
receptors, with some road links experiencing a beneficial effect or being 
of low sensitivity, whereas others may have high sensitivity and high 
magnitude of impact and these will be identified accordingly.  
12.2.32 
Effects of moderate significance or above are considered to be 
significant for the purposes of the assessment. 
Limitations 
12.2.33 
The limitations are split into the following two categories: 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
222 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
 Assessments not yet complete in the PEIR; and 
 Limitations in assessments which will remain in the ES. 
12.2.34 
The assessments not yet complete in the PEIR are as follows: 
 The calculation of trips generated by construction vehicles and 
construction workers; 
 No detailed analysis of routes for abnormal loads has been 
undertaken; 
 Surveys to determine the existing traffic flows on the surrounding 
network had not been undertaken in time for the PEIR 
assessment; and 
 The theoretical capacity of existing junctions was not assessed or 
modelled. 
12.2.35 
The limitation in the assessment which will remain in the ES is that the 
usage of the local road and PRoW networks by non-motorised users was 
not known. 
Consultation and Consultation Responses 
12.2.36 
A summary of the consultation responses received to date from the 
scoping response document in relation to traffic, transport and access, 
and how these will be considered is provided in Appendix 4.1. 
12.3 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Highway Network 
12.3.1 
The B4489 lies west of the Project Site and runs north-south linking 
Felindre to Llangyfelach and is marked with a 40mph speed limit. North 
of the access to the Swansea North electrical substation and Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station, the B4489 is a narrow rural road. It then widens 
to a single carriageway road for the rest of its length, with the stretch 
leading to the junction with the A48 having two lanes south-bound. 
12.3.2 
The Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road is an unclassified road which runs east and 
north of the Project Site, from Pant-lasau to Rhyd-Y-Pandy in an almost 
directly north-south direction. It is of varying width, alternating along its 
length between narrow rural road and single carriageway. The road has 
a 30mph speed limit in proximity to both Pant-lasau and Rhyd-Y-Pandy, 
but increases to national speed limit in between the two settlements. 
12.3.3 
There are several other private roads in proximity to the Project Site, all 
of which are rural in nature.  The local highway network is shown in 
Figure 12.1.

Junctions 
12.3.4 
Consideration will be given to the assessment of junctions within the area 
and will be identified in collaboration with CCS and South Wales Trunk 
Road Agent (SWTRA) at a later stage. An initial scoping assessment of 
junctions has identified the following three junctions as a preliminary 
focus for investigation (see Figure 12.2): 
 M4 Roundabout Junction 46; 
 A48/Pant-lasau Road; and 
 Pant-lasau Road/Heol Maes Eglwys/Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road. 
Road Safety and Collisions 
12.3.5 
An initial review of accident data shows that between 2009 and 2012, 
there was 1 accident on the Rhyd-Y-Pandy Road. This was a slight 
accident involving two vehicles and with one casualty. There were also 
four more slight accidents along the Pant-lasau Road within the same 
time period. One of these involved two vehicles, whilst the other three all 
had only one vehicle involved. All of them had one casualty. 
12.3.6 
There were also several accidents along the B4489 within this time 
period, however, none within close proximity to the Project Site or 
potential access routes. 
12.3.7 
There is a cluster of slight accidents at the M4 Junction 46 roundabout 
which will be expected at a junction of this type. 
12.3.8 
Figure 12.3 provides a summary of the accidents in the study area.

assessment will be undertaken as part of the ES. 
Pedestrian and Cycle Facilities 
12.3.10 
There is no pedestrian footway provision in close proximity to the Project 
Site. However, there is a footway provided on one side of the B4489, for 
approximately 1.2 km north of the M4 Junction 46 (see Figure 12.4).

There is no cycling infrastructure in place within the vicinity of the Project 
Site, except a short, local route which runs from the B4489 for 
approximately 1.5 km to the Pant-lasau Road (see Figure 12.5). 
Bus Services 
12.3.12 
There is one bus route in the vicinity of the Project Site, although there 
are several other bus routes that pass through nearby villages (see 
Figure 12.6). The nearest bus stop is Lliw Reservoirs, approximately 
0.25 km from the entrance of the Access Option 1. The next nearest bus 
stop is Taironen, which is approximately 1.5 km east of Access Option 
1. Both are served by the 142 service provided by South Wales 
Transport, the route of which links Garnwsllt to Swansea, Kingsway. The 
141 service runs between Swansea and Garnswllt and passes south of 
the Project Site through Pant-lasau to Morriston Hospital.

There are no train stations in close proximity to the Project Site. 
Llansamlet is the nearest railway station, approximately 5.5 km south 
east of the Project Site, and is accessible by private car from Junction 44 
of the M4. However, Swansea station, whilst being an extra 2 km away, 
is an important local transport hub and is more easily accessible by 
public transport. 
12.3.14 
Rail services at Swansea station are managed by Arriva Trains Wales. 
There are four services daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly 
service from Swansea to Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff 
Central, and two/three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. 
First Great Western also provides services from Swansea to London 
Paddington, calling at Bristol.

Operation 
12.4.3 
There is likely to be minimal impacts during the operation of the Power 
Generation Plant as operational staff numbers will be low (of the order of 
15 full time employees) and the delivery and removal of goods to the 
Project Site are also expected to be very low.

12.7.2 
The assessment to date has shown that traffic generated by the Project 
will impact upon the surrounding road network, including key junctions at 
the interchange with the M4. Two smaller junctions may also be impacted 
upon depending on the final decision on the access route option. The 
level of impact will be assessed in the ES. 
Construction/Decommissioning  
12.7.3 
The effects of the whole project will be assessed, with the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection each 
generating construction worker trips or HGV deliveries. 
Operation 
12.7.4 
The potential effects predicted to arise from the Electrical Connection 
and the Gas Connection are not material in the context of the Power 
Generation Plant so the overall assessment for the Project as a whole is 
considered to be the same as for the Power Generation Plant. In turn, 
the potential effects resulting from the Power Generation Plant during the 
Operational 
process 
are 
negligible 
in 
comparison 
to 
the 
construction/decommissioning 
period 
and 
therefore 
the 
overall 
assessment for the Project as a whole is not considered to be worse that 
as for the construction/decommissioning phase set out above 
12.8 
Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
12.8.1 
The cumulative effect in terms of number of construction workers and 
therefore trips created by the simultaneous development of the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection on traffic 
will be considered. 
12.8.2 
There will be an assessment of other developments in proximity to the 
Project Site that have the potential to result in detrimental cumulative 
effects on the transport and traffic. This will include both planned 
developments identified in Section 4.8 and those already under 
construction and the list of those to be considered will be agreed upon 
with the relevant authorities at a later date.

ARCHAEOLOGY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE 
13.1 
Introduction 
13.1.1 
This chapter provides the Archaeolology and Cultural Heritage 
preliminary environmental assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power 
Project based upon assessment carried out up to September 2014.  The 
Project is set out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for the 
assessment carried out to date.  
13.1.2 
The following factors have specifically been taken account of in this 
preliminary assessment: the extent of the Power Generation Plant’s 
footprint; the height of the stacks; the route and installation of the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection; and the route of the Access Road 
options.    
13.1.3 
There is no embedded mitigation identified in relation to archaeology and 
cultural heritage. 
13.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
13.2.1 
The archaeology assessment in the PEIR has taken account of planning 
policy and guidance set out in Section 3 and in paragraph 13.3.2 below.  
13.3 
Assessment Methodology 
13.3.1 
A Desk Based Assessment (DBA) has been undertaken in consultation 
with Cadw who has made the following recommendations regards the 
methodology;  
 
Data searches should include aerial photographs as held by 
Central Register of Air Photography for Wales and also LiDAR 
information held by NRW; 
 
Photographs from each asset towards the development site 
should be produced; 
 
Where it is clear that an adverse effect will occur than a 
photomontage should be produced; 
 
The Setting Assessment should consider those designated 
assets within a 5 km Study Area; 
 
Tranquillity should be considered in the Setting Assessment.  
13.3.2 
The DBA included the following searches:

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
 
The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments 
Wales which is the investigative body and national archive for 
the historic environment of Wales and hosts an online search 
facility (Coflein); 
 
Swansea Historic Environment Record (HER) (which includes 
records of any previous archaeological interventions within the 
Scheme Area). The HER will also include details of Registered 
Parks 
and Gardens, Listed Buildings 
and 
Registered 
Battlefields; 
 
Aerial photographs as held by Central Register of Air 
Photography for Wales and LiDAR information held by National 
Resources Wales. 
 
Historic Mapping; and  
 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation.  
13.3.3 
The DBA has been undertaken in accordance with Standard and 
Guidance 
for 
Historic 
Environment 
Desk-based 
Assessment79. 
Furthermore, the assessment has been carried out in accordance with 
the relevant professional guidelines - Institute for Archaeologists (IfA)80, 
English Heritage81 and Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust 
(GGAT82). The assessment of setting has been undertaken in 
accordance with English Heritage guidelines83 (see section 13.2.39). 
13.3.4 
The assessment has been undertaken by a Member of the Institute for 
Archaeologists (IfA). 
13.3.5 
Searches have been limited to 1 km (Inner Study Area) from the Project 
Site for HER entries for archaeology as the Project has the potential to 
impact on archaeological remains within the Project Site and the 
immediate surroundings. 
13.3.6 
As part of the DBA, a site inspection was undertaken of the Project Site 
to identify any previously unknown heritage assets or to assess the 
condition of known assets. During the site inspection a detailed 
photographic record was created and an assessment of the setting of 
the cultural heritage assets was undertaken.     
13.3.7 
In order to gather baseline cultural heritage setting data, and to 
undertake an assessment of the potential effects that the Project Site 
may have on the setting of any above ground remains, selected cultural

heritage assets were visited. This followed an initial study making 
reference to the results of desk-based research, and the ZTV including 
searches of the records listed above. Both the asset and its surrounding 
area was been visited to identify locations that might be relevant to the 
asset’s setting.  
13.3.8 
In accordance with recommendations made by Cadw (see section 
13.3.1), the Setting Assessment considers those designated Heritage 
Assets within a 5 km (Outer Study area) from the Project Site.  
13.3.9 
For the purposes of the setting assessment, the following cultural 
heritage assets (Heritage Assets) have been considered:  
 
Scheduled Monuments;  
 
Listed Buildings; 
 
Registered Parks and Gardens;  
 
World Heritage Sites; and 
 
Any other non-designated building [/structure] which is 
considered to be important in terms of cultural heritage and 
archaeological significance.   
Visibility Maps  
13.3.10 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage have used the same ZTV map as the 
LVIA as a tool in assessing the likely inter-visibility and line of sight 
between the Project and heritage assets.  
13.3.11 
Whilst this is consistent with the overall approach taken to assess the 
realistic worst case scenario and, the use of this type of ZTV map is 
considered good practice, a ZTV map does not present an absolute 
measure of visibility or the ‘visual impact’ of the Project. It is recognised 
best practice by approved public consultees to include those designated 
heritage assets that lie within and just outside the ZTV. The setting 
assessment considered the impact of the Project upon all designated 
cultural heritage assets that lie within a 5 km radius from the Project Site.  
This includes any such assets within the 1 km inner study area (see 
paragraph 13.3.5). 
13.3.12 
The following factors were also considered to be relevant when 
assessing impacts upon setting:   
 
Visual dominance;   
 
Scale;   
 
Intervisibility;

 
Vistas and sight lines;  
 
Movement and light; and  
 
Unaltered settings.  
13.3.13 
At this stage, no intrusive investigations are proposed for cultural 
heritage or archaeological purposes, although this will be agreed with the 
CCS Planning Archaeologist and representative of GGAT or Cadw. 
Should intrusive investigations be necessary, the scope will be agreed 
with the Planning Archaeologist through a Written Scheme of 
Investigation (WSI). 
Significance Criteria 
13.3.14 
The IfA84 considers that an assessment of the significance of heritage 
assets should include archaeological, historic, architectural and artistic 
interests pertaining to the asset. It should identify the potential impact of 
proposed or predicted changes on the significance of the asset and the 
opportunities for reducing that impact. Additionally, this significance may 
derive not only from its physical presence but also from its setting and 
relies heavily upon English Heritage’s ‘The Setting of Heritage Assets’85. 
13.3.15 
English Heritage presents a set of heritage values in their guidance 
document ‘Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance’86: aesthetic, 
communal, historic and evidential, which is the approach adopted for 
analysing significance in this document. Additionally, and in order to 
consider the archaeological and historic significance in particular, an 
additional set of criteria are employed which relate to the Secretary of 
State’s criteria for assessing the national importance of monuments, as 
contained in Annex 1 of the policy statement on scheduled monuments 
produced by the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport 87. These 
criteria 
relate 
to 
period, 
rarity, 
documentation, 
group 
value, 
survival/condition, fragility/vulnerability, diversity, and potential. 
13.3.16 
In accordance with the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges88, which is 
widely adopted by heritage professionals as a standard for the 
quantification of magnitude and impact assessment, the sensitivity, value 
or importance of the Heritage Asset is judged in a neighbourhood, local, 
regional, national and international context. It should be stressed that 
enhancements were made to the criteria more appropriate to 
archaeology and cultural heritage. Furthermore, professional judgement 
was applied throughout the assessment process which results in the

Table 13.1 is a general guide to the attributes of Heritage Assets and it 
should be noted that not all the qualities listed need be present in every 
case and professional judgement is used in balancing the different 
criteria.  
13.3.18 
In order to assess the potential impact of the Project on built heritage or 
buried archaeological remains, consideration has been afforded to

 
Assessing in detail any impact and the significance of the effects 
arising from the construction and operation of the Project; 
 
Reviewing the evidence for past impacts that may have affected 
the archaeological sites of interest identified during the desk-
based assessment; and 
 
Outlining suitable mitigation measures, where possible at this 
stage, to avoid, reduce, or remedy adverse effects. 
13.3.19 
Each potential impact has been determined as the predicted deviation 
from the baseline conditions, in accordance with current knowledge of 
the Project Site and the Project. The impact is assessed in terms of the 
sensitivity or value of the Heritage Asset and the magnitude of change 
or potential scale of impact during the Project. The magnitude, or scale 
of an impact is often difficult to define, but will be termed as substantial, 
moderate, minor, or negligible, as shown in Table 13.2, below. 
Table 13.2: Criteria used to determine Scale of Impact 
Magnitude of 
Impact 
Description 
Substantial 
Significant change in environmental factors; Complete destruction of 
the site or feature; Change to the site or feature resulting in a 
fundamental change in ability to understand and appreciate the 
resource and its cultural heritage or archaeological value/historical 
context and setting. 
Moderate 
Significant change in environmental factors; Change to the site or 
feature resulting in an appreciable change in ability to understand 
and appreciate the resource and its cultural heritage or 
archaeological value/historical context and setting. 
Minor 
Change to the site or feature resulting in a small change in our ability 
to understand and appreciate the resource and its cultural heritage or 
archaeological value/historical context and setting. 
Negligible 
Negligible change or no material changes to the site or feature. No 
real change in our ability to understand and appreciate the resource 
and its cultural heritage or archaeological value/historical context and 
setting. 
 
13.3.20 
The interaction of the potential scale of impact (Table 13.2) and the 
importance of the Heritage Asset (Table 13.1) produce the effect’s 
significance. This may be calculated by using the matrix shown in Table 
4.3. 
13.3.21 
As there is currently no set procedure for the assessment of impact on 
setting within Wales, guidelines published by English Heritage have 
Abergelli Power Project

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
been used. The definition of setting used here is taken from the NPPF89: 
“setting is the surroundings in which an asset is experienced. Its extent 
is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surrounding evolve. 
Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the 
significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that 
significance or may be neutral”. Furthermore, the Cadw document 
‘Conservation Principles for the Sustainable Management of the Historic 
Environment in Wales’90 states that setting also relates to the asset’s 
local context, embracing present and past relationships to the adjacent 
landscape. English Heritage considers that the significance of a heritage 
asset derives not only from its physical presence and historic fabric, but 
also from its setting – the surrounding within which it is experienced. 
13.3.22 
English Heritage in its guidance document, ‘The Setting of Heritage 
Assets’91 has provided a stepped approach to the assessment of 
significance of setting to heritage assets. Following the initial 
identification of the heritage asset(s) and associated setting the following 
steps comprise: 
 
Assessing whether, how and to what degree the settings make a 
contribution to the significance of the heritage assets; 
 
Assessing the effect of the development on the setting, and the 
resulting implications for the significance of the heritage asset(s); 
and 
 
Maximising enhancement and minimising harm (mitigation). 
13.3.23 
In assessing whether, how and to what degree the settings make a 
contribution to the significance of the heritage assets, a number of 
potential attributes of a setting may help in determining its significance. 
These are presented in Table 13.3 below.

 The rarity of comparable survivals of setting. 
The asset’s associative attributes: 
 Associative relationships between heritage assets; 
 Cultural associations; 
 Celebrated artistic representations; 
 Traditions. 
13.3.24 
Having assessed the contribution of the setting to the significance of the 
asset, the effect of a development on the setting can be determined by 
consideration of the potential attributes of the development affecting 
setting. These are outlined in Table 13.4 below.

13.3.25 
Once the contribution of the setting has been determined and the 
potential attributes of the Project upon it have been identified, the 
contribution needs to be evaluated in order to determine the magnitude 
of the impact. This is undertaken using the definitions presented in Table 
13.5 below.  
Table 13.5: Definitions of Sensitivity for the Settings of Heritage 
Assets 
Sensitivity

the asset 
Examples for settings 
Very high 
Very substantial 
A defined setting that is contemporary with 
and historically and functionally linked with 
the heritage asset, may contain other 
heritage assets of international or national 
importance, has a very high degree of 
intervisibility with the asset and makes a very 
substantial contribution to both the 
significance of the heritage asset and to the 
understanding and appreciation of the 
significance of the asset.   
High 
Substantial 
Contemporary with and historically and 
functionally linked with the heritage asset, 
with minor alterations (in extent and/or 
character), has a high degree of intervisibility 
with the asset and which makes a substantial 
contribution to both the significance of the 
heritage asset and to the understanding and 
appreciation of the significance of the asset.

Examples for settings 
Medium 
Moderate 
Contemporary with and/or historically and/or 
functionally linked with the heritage asset but 
with alterations which may detract from the 
understanding of the heritage asset, and/or 
with a moderate degree of intervisibility with

contribution to the significance of the heritage 
asset and/or a moderate contribution to the 
understanding and appreciation of the 
significance of the asset.   
Low 
Minor 
Largely altered so that there is very little 
evidence of contemporaneous and/or historic 
and/or functional links with the heritage asset, 
and/or with a low degree of intervisibility with 
the asset and/or which makes a minor 
contribution to both the significance of the 
heritage asset and to the understanding and 
appreciation of the significance of the asset.   
 
13.3.26 
Changes may occur in the surroundings of an asset that neither affects 
their contribution to the significance of the asset, nor the extent to which 
its significance can be experienced. In such instances it will be 
considered that there is no impact upon setting. 
13.3.27 
The criteria for assessing the magnitude of direct impacts on setting are 
presented below (Table 13.6). The sensitivity of a heritage asset to 
changes in its setting can be evaluated in the first instance by reference 
to any relevant designation, whereby those designated as internationally 
important will generally be considered the most sensitive. At the other 
end of the scale assets that are imperceptible or very difficult to perceive 
on the ground will generally be less sensitive than those that are more 
readily appreciable as they are to some extent already divorced from 
their setting. 
Table 13.6: Criteria for Assessment of Magnitude of an Impact on 
the Setting of a Heritage Asset 
Magnitude 
Guideline Criteria 
Major beneficial 
The contribution of setting to the cultural heritage asset’s 
significance is considerably enhanced as a result of the 
development; a lost relationship between the asset and its 
setting is restored, or the legibility of the relationship is greatly 
enhanced.  Elements of the surroundings that detract from the 
asset’s cultural heritage significance or the appreciation of 
that significance are removed.

Magnitude 
Guideline Criteria 
Moderate beneficial 
The contribution of setting to the cultural heritage asset’s 
significance is enhanced to a clearly appreciable extent as a 
result of the development; as a result the relationship between 
the asset and its setting is rendered more readily apparent.  
The negative effect of elements of the surroundings that 
detract from the asset’s cultural heritage significance or the 
appreciation of that significance is appreciably reduced.   
Minor beneficial 
The setting of the cultural heritage asset is slightly improved 
as a result of the development, slightly improving the degree 
to which the setting’s relationship with the asset can be 
appreciated. 
Negligible 
The setting of the cultural heritage asset is changed by the 
development in ways that do not alter the contribution of 
setting to the asset’s significance. 
Minor adverse 
The contribution of the setting of the cultural heritage asset to 
its significance is slightly degraded as a result of the 
development, but without adversely affecting the 
interpretability of the asset and its setting; characteristics of 
historic value can still be appreciated, the changes do not 
strongly conflict with the character of the site, and could be 
easily reversed to approximate the pre-development 
conditions. 
Moderate adverse 
The contribution of the setting of the cultural heritage asset to 
its significance is reduced appreciably as a result of the 
development.  Relevant setting characteristics can still be 
appreciated but less readily.   
Major adverse 
The contribution of the setting of the cultural heritage asset to 
its significance is effectively lost or substantially reduced as a 
result of the development, the relationship between the asset 
and its setting is no longer readily appreciable.   
 
 Limitations 
13.3.28 
This preliminary assessment is based on the Project as presented at the 
time of compiling this report. Changes to the Project and any additional 
technical data made available will be considered as the assessment 
progress. Any comments received on the preliminary findings of the 
assessment from the appropriate Planning Archaeologist should also be 
taken into consideration for future assessment or investigations. 
Furthermore, the accuracy of the baseline data as supplied by 
recognised and approved organisations will not be questioned.

13.4.4 
Five non-designated Heritage Assets have been identified within the 
Project Site and their importance (value) assessed in accordance with 
the DMRB criteria outlined in Table 13.1: 
 
HA11 (Quarry); an Industrial period site of a quarry situated 
within Mawr. First identified on 1896-97 OS mapping, the 
asset is depicted as a 'Gravel Pit' to the south west of Aber-
gelli-fach (HA29). The site of asset has since been 
redeveloped. The asset is considered to be of low (local) 
value; 
 
HA29 (Aber-gelli-fach); an Industrial period site of an 
extensive farmstead first identified on the Map of Glamorgan 
(1799). The site may have earlier origins. The farmstead has 
since been demolished and replaced with two modern 
residential buildings. The asset is considered to be of low 
(local) value; 
 
HA30 (Aber-gelli-fawr); an Industrial period site of a farmstead 
first identified on 2”:1 mile maps of Glamorgan and 
Monmouthshire (1812-14). The farmstead has been 
demolished and the plot remains empty. The asset is 
considered to be of low (local) value; 
 
HA31 (possible ancient field boundary): Field boundary with 
stoned foundations located immediately north of HA29. First

Cumulative Effects 
Construction/Decommissioning 
13.9.1 
The development of the Project or other planned developments identified 
in Section 4.8 are not anticipated to have any significant cumulative 
effects as they will not likely create a larger impact upon standing or 
below ground archaeological remains than the individual projects taken 
in isolation. The level of effects are comparable with the conclusions 
reached in the Landscape Chapter (Section 11.7) and are as follows; 
 
Construction of the Mynydd y Gwair Wind Farm is occurring 6 km 
from the Project and is not within the ZTV. The proposed 
development is unlikely to be noticeable in and around or in 
combination with the Project Site. The area identified for the wind 
farm is not within the Zone of Visual Influence for the Project. 
Preliminary viewpoint pVP6 (see Figure 11.2) is located on the 
northern side of the wind farm and as it is expected that the Project 
archaeological 
remains 
construction is 
likely to disturb or 
destroy any 
surviving below

archaeological 
remains

Site will be out of view from this location, there will be no 
cumulative effects from viewpoints in the north. Views from the 
south looking northwards to the Project Site will have the wind 
farm as a backdrop. The addition of the stacks associated with the 
Project will increase the amount of utility infrastructure in the view. 
However, these are different types of vertical structures 
(stacks/wind turbine) and will be perceived as different types of 
development in the landscape. It is expected that there will be 
some cumulative visual effects on viewpoints south of the Project 
Site.  
 
The Felindre Business Park is currently under construction and is 
therefore likely to be complete before the construction of the 
Project commences (other than minor works). The urban village 
is not yet at planning stage and is unlikely to be on site in the near 
future. Therefore it is not expected that there will be any significant 
cumulative effects during the construction period. 
 
The solar park at Brynhillach Farm is at planning application stage 
and it is feasible that it maybe be underway on site at the same 
time as the Project. Although some cumulative effects can be 
expected, for most receptors there will be no effect as intervisibility 
with the Project Site at ground level (where most of the 
construction activities will be taking place) is limited. 
Operation 
13.9.2 
There are not anticipated to be any significant cumulative effects 
resulting from the operation of the Project or operation of other planned 
developments within the vicinity of the Project Site. 
13.10 
Summary and Conclusions 
13.10.1 
At this preliminary stage of the assessment, it has been determined that 
there will be a neutral to negligible effect upon the setting of historic 
assets within the 5 km Study Area resulting from the construction and 
operation of the Power Generation Plant.  
13.10.2 
There is the potential for a moderate/major effect upon the standing 
remains of HA32 resulting from damage to the asset by construction 
traffic along Access Road Option 1. There is also potential for a 
moderate/major effect upon HA31 if the Gas Connection is routed 
through the asset. However, these effects will be limited by 
implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, which are to be 
devised in consultation with the Planning Archaeologist (and relevant 
statutory consultees).

SOCIO-ECONOMICS 
14.1 
Introduction 
14.1.1 
This chapter provides the socio-economic preliminary environmental 
assessment of the proposed Abergelli Power Project based upon 
assessment carried out up to end of September 2014.  The proposed 
development is set out in Chapter 2 which forms the primary basis for 
the assessment carried out to date.   
14.1.2 
The following factors have specifically been taken account of in this 
preliminary assessment.  The project assessment scenario is based on 
the possible worst case in terms of job requirements and demand on 
community infrastructure which presents worst case scenario from a 
socio-economic point of view.  The assessment has considered 
potentially significant effects which may be caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project on the labour market, 
tourism businesses and community infrastructure. 
14.2 
Approach 
Relevant Policy and Guidance 
14.2.1 
The socio-economic assessment in the PEIR has taken account of 
planning policy and guidance set out in Section 3. 
14.2.2 
The assessment will follow UK Government guidelines and best practice. 
The methodology used to estimate impacts follows guidance set out in 
the HM Treasury’s Green Book and Homes and Communities Agency 
(HCA) Additionality Guide, as well as taking account of the Department 
for Business Innovation and Skills research on additionality. 
Study Areas 
14.2.3 
The socio-economic and tourism study areas are as follows:   
 
Socio economic study area - The socio-economic assessment 
is based on drive time catchment areas from the Project.  The 
‘local area’ is defined within a 30 minute drive time, ‘wider area’ 
within a 45 minute drive time, and ‘wider region’ within a 60 minute 
drive time (see Socio-economic Figures document: Figure 14.1);    
 
Tourism study area - The tourism assessment is focussed on the 
area defined by a 15 km radius from the Project.  Facilities or 
notable points of focus of visitor attraction within this area have 
been reviewed.  Any significant tourism facilities located just 
outside the boundary have also been included (see Socio-
economic Figures document: Figure 14.2); 
Abergelli Power Project 
 Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
272 
Parsons Brinckerhoff 
September 2014 
 
on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
 
Community Infrastructure study area - As proximity is likely to 
be the main determinant of impacts and their scale, the status (or 
catchment) of community facility receptors in an area determines 
the scale and significance of any impacts.  
Assessment Methodology 
14.2.4 
Data and information from national, regional and local databases have 
been reviewed, identifying information gaps and requirements for data 
gathering e.g. business, accommodation and other surveys. 
14.2.5 
The study area’s socio-economic position has been described using 
standard indicators. This provides a baseline from which potential 
impacts can be assessed as follows: 
 
Economic/Labour Market: the area has been defined using a 
combination of: standard sources and indicators: research 
available at study area level; and research into the business and 
labour market structure of the local economy; 
 
Tourism: the area’s visitor attraction has been profiled including: 
visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and 
value; and the local tourism economy; 
 
Social: Indices of deprivation and demographic structure have 
been examined.  An audit of community infrastructure has been 
prepared; and 
 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other 
relevant policy has been reviewed to identify related economic, 
social and regeneration objectives which the Project may affect 
(whether contributing to their realisation or otherwise). 
14.2.6 
A detailed assessment of likely effects on the local, regional and national 
economy has been prepared. This assesses the scale of:  
 
Direct economic impacts: jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA)  
that 
are 
wholly 
or 
largely 
related 
to 
construction, 
decommissioning, and operation and maintenance of the Project; 
 
Indirect economic impacts (positive and negative): jobs and 
GVA generated in the  study area in the chain of suppliers of 
goods and services to the direct activities; 
 
Induced economic impacts: jobs and GVA created by direct and 
indirect employees’ spending in the study area or in the wider 
economy; and 
 
Wider economic (catalytic) impacts (positive and negative): 
employment and income generated in the economy related to the 
Abergelli Power Project

wider role of the Project in influencing economic activities 
(including wider socio-economic effects).  
14.2.7 
The availability of appropriate labour and skills to meet the Project’s 
construction and operational requirements is a critical consideration in 
examining economic impacts. Adequate capacity results in a low 
sensitivity while a shortfall or constrained capacity yields a high 
sensitivity.   
14.2.8 
The key socio-economic indicators for the Study Area include: 
 
The proportion of skilled workers in the study area relative to 
national averages; 
 
Educational attainment levels compared with British averages; 
 
The proportion of employment in relevant sectors (i.e. 
manufacturing and construction workers) in the Study Area; 
 
The availability of labour (including the unemployed workforce); 
and 
 
Relevant education and training provision, including existing and 
proposed programmes provided by institutions serving the study 
area.  
14.2.9 
Tourism and recreational behaviour will only be detrimentally affected 
where the effects of the Project either change the visitor/user pattern in 
terms of numbers, and/or their patterns of expenditure for the worse.  As 
such, opportunities for tourist and visitor expenditure, any potential 
variation in expenditure or visitor numbers, and consequent effects on 
turnover or employment are of key importance.     
14.2.10 
A business survey has been carried out to gain a more detailed 
understanding of the local tourism economy and its current 
performance.  Businesses contacted include key visitor accommodation 
providers, leisure activity providers and other relevant tourism 
businesses. 
14.2.11 
Visitor facilities and notable points of focus in the study area have been 
identified.  Based on the Project’s anticipated visibility, the assessment 
comments on the likelihood of the Project influencing visitor and tourist 
attitudes and behaviour towards them.  
14.2.12 
The significance of effects on Tourism is assessed by reference to the 
sensitivity of the receptor and the anticipated magnitude of impact.  
14.2.13 
In considering the level of tourism sensitivity, the standing of the receptor 
or resource is the defining factor. This is established against: 
Abergelli Power Project

on behalf of Abergelli Power Ltd 
 
Tourism business’ relative attraction to customers from outside 
the Study Area and the Project’s potential to influence broader 
perceptions of the area.  Where a majority of trade is non-local 
this is more likely to be the case; and 
 
The relative importance of tourism as a business sector. Where 
tourism is more important relative to other sectors, impacts may 
have the potential to generate broader impacts. Similarly, where 
it is of relatively low significance, impacts on tourism and related 
sectors are unlikely to generate a high level of adverse impact 
across the broader economy. 
14.2.14 
An assessment of the likely significant effects on local, regional and 
national community receptors during construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project have been carried out. This assessment 
includes an audit of community infrastructure facilities/receptors within 
the local area and its associated effects (i.e. effects on local schools, 
local authority services and other infrastructure).  
14.2.15 
The assessment of residual effects examines the likely impacts of the 
Project; whether the Project will have residual effects on its local and 
wider socio-economic context, and the potential impact of the Project 
when combined with other development proposals in the area.   
Significance Criteria 
14.2.16 
In addition to quantitative and qualitative assessment, significance of 
effects is defined by the combination of the sensitivity of receptors and 
the magnitude of impacts upon them. The criteria set out below are 
specific to socio-economic factors and have been adopted to assess 
receptor sensitivity and impact magnitude. They therefore differ from 
those listed in Chapter 4 of this PEIR.  
 
Table 14.1 Socio-Economic Sensitivity Criteria 
Sensitivity  
Example 
Very High 
The area has a shortfall of appropriate labour and skills. 
The Project will lead to excessive labour market pressure and distortions (i.e. 
skills and capacity shortages, import of labour, wage inflation). 
High  
The area has constrained supply of labour and skills.  
The Project will lead to labour market pressure and distortions (i.e. skills and 
capacity shortages, import of labour, wage inflation). 
Medium  
The area has a low/ limited supply of labour and skills.  
The Project could lead to labour market pressure or distortions. 
Low  
The receptor has a readily available labour force.  
The Project is unlikely to lead to labour market pressure or distortions.

In line with Table 4.3, the sensitivity of receptors as defined in the tables 
above is considered against the magnitude of impact to determine the 
significance of effect.  The assumption relating to which effects are 
significant is set out in paragraph 4.6.3. 
Limitations 
14.2.23 
A comprehensive socio-economic assessment will be carried out for the 
ES.  The following tasks will provide greater precision on the likely impact 
of the Project:  
 Economic Impact Model (net additional employment and GVA 
impact of Project);   
 Tourism related business survey (will help define the sensitivity of 
tourism related businesses with 15km of the Project); and  
 Mapping of tourism and recreation and community infrastructure 
facilities.

As indicated in Table 14.7, all areas have experienced population 
increases since 2001, a trend which is expected to continue to 2021.  
Over the same period the population of the UK has increased and is 
expected to rise further. The local area population is expected to grow at 
a slightly higher rate in the future than that experienced between 2001 
and 2013.  Population growth in the wider area and wider region is

Projections indicates that the local area, wider area and wider region are 
expected to see a reduction in the working age population and increases 
in their dependency ratio93 which is likely to put additional pressure on 
services in the various areas.  By 2021 over a fifth of the local and wider 
area's population is expected to be of retirement age.  This is greater 
than the projected UK averages.

National Readership Survey (NRS) social grades are a system of 
demographic classification widely used in market research95.  The NRS 
social grades also provide an insight into the skills profile of a population.  
14.3.9 
As shown in Table 14.12, the local area, wider area and wider region 
each have a lower than average proportion of people in the highest and 
second highest social grades (AB and C1). Each area also a higher 
proportion of people in the lowest social grades (DE).

14.3.11 
The socio-economic study area97 surrounding the Project is 
characterised by: 
 An increasing population (2001-2013); 
 Projected population increase of c.6% between 2013 and 2021, 
higher than the UK average; 
 a growing retirement age population; 
 an economic activity rate higher than the UK average; 
 slightly higher levels of unemployment comparable to the UK 
average; 
 A slightly higher proportion of people working in manufacturing;   
 A comparable proportion of people working in the construction 
sector;   
 A higher proportion of people employed in semi-skilled/unskilled 
jobs and lower proportion of people in highly skilled jobs and; 
 A higher proportion of people achieving no qualifications and low 
level qualifications compared to the UK average. 
14.3.12 
The socio-economic study area exhibits some characteristics consistent 
with a low sensitivity labour market (i.e. increasing population, above 
average economic activity, appropriate levels of construction and 
manufacturing workers) and some characteristics consistent with a 
medium sensitivity labour market (i.e. low skills and educational profile).     
It is unlikely that the Project will lead to undue labour market pressure or 
distortions (i.e. wage inflation, skills and capacity shortages, import of 
labour). 
14.3.13 
The overall sensitivity of the labour market is assessed as low/ medium. 
Tourism Volume and Value 
14.3.14 
A tourism business survey will be carried out in preparing the final ES 
Chapter. This will provide an indication of the sensitivity of the local 
tourism economy.  Tourism related businesses will be asked provide an

In the PEIR, the tourism economy is assessed using visitor statistics for 
Swansea and the South West Wales area.       
14.3.16 
Domestic visitor tourism spending and bed-nights are at their highest 
level since 2006-08 (Table 14.14).  Visitor trips, despite falling recently, 
remain high and above average.  Overseas tourism appears to be 
declining in Swansea.  Overseas trips, bed-nights and spending are at 
their lowest level since 2006.

Table 14.15 shows the top 10 paid and unpaid visitor attractions in South 
West Wales.   Two attractions, the LC (Leisure Centre98) and the National 
Waterfront Museum, are in the tourism study area.   The LC was the top 
paid attraction in Wales in 2013 and the National Waterfront Museum 
was ranked as number 8 in the free attractions. Both attractions are 
indoor and more than 5km from the Project.   Each attraction will be 
assessed as an individual receptor in ES Chapter and included in the 
tourism business survey to establish perceived impact on visitor activity.

The overall sensitivity of the Project’s tourism economy and main visitor 
attractions within the study area is assessed as low.

Community Infrastructure  
14.3.19 
Demand for community infrastructure facilities could arise from the in-
migration of construction workers during the temporary construction 
phase.  This requirement is likely to be minimal.   An initial audit of 
community facilities indicates the provision of the following community 
infrastructure facilities in the area.   
 
21 schools within 3 miles of the Project Site;  
 
5 GP surgeries;  
 
1 hospital; 
 
6 pharmacies; and 
 
1 library.  
14.3.20 
The level of existing community infrastructure is considered to be 
sufficient to accommodate additional demand.  The overall sensitivity of 
the local area’s community infrastructure is assessed as low.

Cumulative Effects 
14.7.1 
The projects identified in Section 4.8 have been identified as having the 
potential to have cumulative effects alongside the Project.  Proposed 
development within the Swansea Vale Development Area will also be 
considered.  The cumulative effect of these developments will be 
assessed alongside the Project in detail in the final ES. 
14.8 
Summary and Conclusions 
14.8.1 
No significant labour market, tourism and recreation and community 
infrastructure effects are anticipated given there is an availability of 
skilled, construction labour with a 60 minute drive time.   The visual 
impact of energy infrastructure has also already been established in the 
area surrounding the Project. 
14.8.2 
Building from this preliminary assessment the following steps will be 
undertaken in the next phase of socio-economic analysis and presented 
in the ES: 
 
A mapping of the ZTV analysis against tourism and recreational 
receptors in the area to gain a better understanding of the 
potential visual impact of the assessment; 
 
The impact assessment will be informed in part by a Business 
Survey, which will ask local tourism-related businesses in the 
area what impact the Project will have on their business and on 
tourism in the wider area;

CONCLUSION 
15.1 
Conclusion 
15.1.1 
The preliminary assessment as described in the PEIR has identified the 
following significant residual effects resulting from the Project: 
 The risk of flooding is low.  However, should it occur, such as from 
a burst watermain, the effects may be significant due to the 
possible damage to the Project or harm to workers that may occur; 
 Some views of the stacks are are unlikely to be mitigated by 
planting; 
 It is considered unlikely that there will be permanent residual 
effects associated with the construction of the Project. The effects 
relating to construction activities are all temporary; and 
 During construction it is anticipated that there will be some 
increases in traffic and some disruption to the road network during 
off peak times.  These effects will all be temporary as there will be 
limited traffic during operation of the Project.   
15.1.2 
As the design work and EIA are completed, the Applicant will seek to 
identify further mitigation measures to aim to reduce these effects where 
appropriate. 
15.2 
Cumulative Effects 
15.2.1 
The preliminary findings of the assessment have concluded that there 
are unlikely to be any adverse cumulative effects when the Project is 
considered in combination with those developments identified in Section 
4.8 of this PEIR.  This work will be further refined and presented in the 
ES. 
15.2.2 
The likely significant environmental effects of the Project on receptors 
identified in this PEIR when considered cumulatively i.e. more than one 
effect on the same receptor, will be considered as part of the full EIA.  
However, the preliminary assessment indicates that there are unlikely to 
be any significant cumulative effects.
