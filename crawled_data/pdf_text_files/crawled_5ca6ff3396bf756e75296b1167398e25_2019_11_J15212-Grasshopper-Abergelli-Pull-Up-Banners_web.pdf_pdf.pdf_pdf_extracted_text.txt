Air Quality 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the potential to affect 
air quality.
Preliminary Assessment 
A desk based assessment, including the baseline environment in the local area and air dispersion 
modelling, has been carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from the Project 
on identified residential and ecological receptors. This assessment considers generation of dust during 
the construction and decommissioning phases, as well as the generation of stack emissions during 
operation. The steps we have taken to assess and mitigate this are outlined below.
Construction and Decommissioning 
Dust may result from works during construction, such as earth moving operations for new foundations, 
and for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. The volume of traffic during construction and 
operation is expected to be small and, as a result, impacts from vehicle exhaust emissions will be 
temporary and localised in nature. 
Operation
The Generating Equipment has the potential to affect air quality through the emission of flue gases 
resulting from the combustion of natural gas. This includes the release of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). 
Modern gas fired power plants are, however, inherently cleaner and produce far fewer emissions than 
other fossil fuel power plants when compared on an energy output basis. Emissions from the Generating 
Equipment are also limited by the number of hours the Project can operate. 
Proposed Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation against the unwanted spread of dust would be addressed by the Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) through appropriate dust mitigation measures such as covering stockpiles 
or dowsing them with water during dry, windy conditions. A Construction Traffic Management Plan will 
be prepared to minimise the increase in congestion and vehicle emissions. Mitigation against negative 
effects resulting from flue gas emissions during operation is to be achieved through appropriate 
plant design – most notably through correct stack height. In order to determine stack height, air 
quality impact assessments have been undertaken using air dispersion modelling. The results of these 
assessments indicate that the appropriate stack height for the proposed Generating Equipment, which 
will achieve adequate dispersion of flue gas emissions, is between 35 m and 45 m. 
Cumulative Effects
There are no other permitted or proposed developments within the study area which may result in air 
quality impacts during construction, or any other large combustion sources currently or proposed to be 
in operation.
Conclusion
Given the stack height identified based on air quality modelling, and based on the Preliminary 
Environmental Assessments, there are not anticipated to be any significant effects on air quality as a 
result of the Project during construction, operation or decommissioning.

Noise and Vibration
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project have the 
potential to impact upon noise and vibration.
Preliminary Information
A desk based study and baseline noise monitoring were undertaken to establish baseline sound levels 
at local noise sensitive receptors. The study area has been determined to incorporate the nearest 
representative Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) in all directions as shown on the figure below. These are 
all residential dwellings.
The noise environment is characterised by animals, farming activities and distant road traffic during 
the day, the wind in trees and distant road traffic at night, and noise from the existing Swansea North 
Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station.
The sound levels measured during the baseline noise survey complied with environmental noise limit 
guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) at all but one receptor. At that receptor, the 
baseline noise levels are already exceeded without the Project being present.
Construction and Decommissioning 
Noise disturbance as a result of construction and decommissioning could arise from activities such as 
excavation for foundations, delivery of the plant, and excavation of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection. This will however be a temporary source of noise. 
Operation 
The effects during the operational phase are limited to the Generating Equipment. Operational noise 
and vibration effects from the Access Road and the Above Ground Installation are negligible, and 
therefore have been scoped out of the assessment. The buried Electrical Cable and Gas Pipeline will 
have no noise impact.
No causes of significant vibration associated with the Project are known; the primary rotating 
equipment within the generator set will be balanced to a high degree and constantly monitored for 
any changes in the vibration levels it produces. Therefore further assessment of operational vibration is 
scoped out of the assessment.
At NSRs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 (see figure on the next board) the night time ambient sound levels predicted 
to be produced by the Generating Equipment were recorded to have minor adverse effects, and 
therefore not significant. The pre-existing night time baseline noise limit at NSR 4 is already above WHO 
environmental noise limit guidelines. The ambient night time baseline noise limits for that receptor are 
unchanged after the addition of the sound from the Generating Equipment. Therefore the impact of the 
Generating Equipment on the sound environment during the night time period is negligible.

Sound levels for common situations
The background noise levels during the daytime at the NSRs is between 39 and 43 dB LA90. The predicted 
sound from the Generating Equipment plus +3 dB correction for the potential distinctive character of the 
Equipment is 32 - 38 dB. Therefore the daytime impact of the project on the NSRs is very low.

Noise and Vibration
Proposed Mitigation Measures 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) would be adhered to in order to mitigate 
noise impacts from construction activities. Embedded mitigation in the form of high performance 
silencers, the acoustic cladding of the gas turbine generator, and the use of inherently quiet plant items 
will minimise any potential effects of noise during operation. 
Conclusion
Provided that the limits identified in the Preliminary Environmental Information Report are met, no 
likely significant effects are anticipated from noise as a result of the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project.

Ecology
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the proposed Project have 
the potential to impact upon the local ecology and disturb various sensitive species. 
Preliminary information
A desk based study has been undertaken for a 2 km radius for nationally designated sites (Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest, Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation) and 10 km for internationally 
designated sites (Ramsar, Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Area).
The following ecological surveys have been undertaken to re-establish the ecological baseline since the  
2014 Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR):
l Habitat survey; 
l Dormouse survey;
l Great crested newt survey; 
l Badger survey; and,
l Reptile survey; 
l Bat roost assessment and activity survey. 
l Otter and water vole survey;
A summary of the results from the Phase 2 protected species surveys on and surrounding the Project 
Site is provided in the table below.
Species
Results obtained to date 
Badger
Signs of badgers have been recorded in the area during the surveys.
Bats
At least ten species of bats have been recorded during surveys. No 
buildings suitable for supporting bats have been identified within the 
Project Site boundary. A single tree within the Project Site boundary is 
confirmed as a summer bat roost. 
Breeding Birds
Surveys identified a locally important breeding bird assemblage. 
Included within the assemblage are nine species of Welsh biodiversity 
importance, eight that are red-listed for conservation in the UK 
and eight that are amber-listed for conservation in the UK. During 
the field surveys no Schedule 1 species were identified as breeding 
(Schedule 1 birds are afforded additional protection under UK 
legislation from disturbance during nesting).
Dormouse
No dormice were identified during any of the field surveys. It is likely 
dormice are absent from the Project Site and will be scoped out of 
any further assessment.
Amphibians
Populations of common toads, palmate newts and/or smooth newts 
were identified during field surveys. Common toad is a Section 7 
species. No great crested newts were recorded during the surveys.
Otter
It is likely that otters use the suitable watercourses within the otter 
survey area and Project Site boundary for occasional foraging, 
commuting, resting and holt creation; although no evidence of holts 
was identified during the survey. 
Water Vole
No current evidence of water vole was identified during the field 
surveys and it is likely that water vole are absent from the water vole 
survey area.
Reptiles
A ‘Good’ breeding population of common lizard was identified 
during the field surveys. It is assumed that grass snake is present 
based on the results of the 2014 survey. 
Terrestrial and  
Aquatic 
Invertebrates
Nationally scarce beetle species were identified during the field 
surveys. Priority invertebrate (beetle, butterfly and moth) species 
were identified during the field surveys. The majority of the Section 7 
invertebrate species identified are known to be common throughout 
the region and/or UK. 
Invasive 
Species 
Three invasive species of plant were recorded during the 2017 Phase 
1 Habitat Survey. The final design will seek to avoid the locations 
where these species were recorded where possible. Should this not 
be possible, suitable mitigation measures will be put in place.

Ecology
Proposed mitigation measures
Mitigation in relation to ecology will consist of the production of a Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP), as well as ecological enhancement measures such as replacement habitats 
where possible via the Landscape and Reinstatement Plan, pre-construction surveys and production of a 
Reptile Method Statement. 
As a result, no residual significant effects have been identified for habitats or species during the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. 
Next steps
The following surveys are ongoing and will be undertaken in 2018:
l Hedgerow survey in April 2018;
l Ongoing bat activity surveys in April and May 2018; and
l Breeding bird survey in March / April 2018.
It is also intended to continue liaison with the City and County of Swansea Council and Natural 
Resources Wales regarding the ecological mitigation required for reptiles and other species present 
onsite.

Water Quality and Resources
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed Project has the 
potential to impact upon water quality and resources. 
Preliminary information
An assessment of the likely significant effects on water quality, water resources and flood risk has been 
undertaken.
The study area adopted with respect to the water quality and water resources extends beyond the 
Project Site boundary as shown in the figure below. The study area includes the area within the 
Project Site boundary and a potential zone of influence (ZoI) which is defined as a distance over which 
significant effects on important water receptors/features can reasonably have the potential to occur. 
A desk study and Project Site walkover has identified a number of receptors (waterbodies) within 1 km 
of the Project Site, including the Afon Llan and its tributaries, ponds within the Project Site Boundary 
and several Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation. The Loughor Estuary / Bury Inlet Special Area 
of Conservation is located 7 km from the Project Site Boundary.
Mitigation Measures 
Mitigation measures to reduce the effects on groundwater and surface water features, such as the Afon 
Llan and its tributaries, will include settlement ponds, directional drilling techniques, careful siting of 
stockpiles and implementation of Sustainable Drainage Systems.
Construction and Decommissioning
There is a potential negligible effect from discharging water from construction excavations containing 
increased pollutants (such as hydrocarbons, oils and other hazardous products), and sediment loads 
from movement of materials, to all identified receptors with the exception of the Loughor Estuary, which 
was considered to have a minor adverse effect. 
Operation
The surface water runoff from impermeable areas, and disruption of water storage and flow from the 
presence of the Generating Equipment Site on the Afon Llan and its tributaries are predicted to have 
minor adverse effects. This is therefore not significant. 
Conclusion
No significant effects are anticipated on water quality and resources as a result of the Project during 
construction, operation or decommissioning.

Geology, ground conditions  
and hydrogeology
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed Project has the 
potential to impact upon geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology. 
Preliminary information
A desk-based assessment and site walkover have been undertaken to characterise the baseline 
environment of the Project Site to make a preliminary assessment of any potential impacts. The study 
area for this topic is an area up to 1 km from the Project Site boundary. 
The desk-based assessment identified no landfill sites, groundwater abstraction or pollution incidents 
within the Project Site. The land-use is predominantly agricultural, used for sheep and horse grazing 
bounded by drainage ditches, fencing and hedgerows. 
There are four types of superficial deposits identified across the Project Site comprising of glacial till, 
deposits of sand and gravel, alluvium deposits of clay, silt, sand and gravel, and peat. The superficial 
deposits and underlying geology are both classified as Secondary A Aquifers, which are highly sensitive 
controlled waters.
Within the 1 km study area of the Project Site there are ten records of historical ground working 
features which have all ceased production. These comprise nine opencast mines producing sandstones, 
sands and gravel and one underground mine producing coal. 
There are no known potential sources of contamination within the Project Site boundary however offsite 
sources may comprise historic landfill, landfill extension and localised contamination from agricultural 
land use. 
The City and County of Swansea Council records indicate that sand and gravel reserves are present 
underlying the Project Site.
Construction and Decommissioning
The construction and decommissioning works associated with the Power Generation Plant, such 
as ground disturbance and potential pollution incidents, will not result in significant effects. The 
construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection will result in the temporary sterilisation of 
agricultural land and other potential mineral resources. This will not result in significant effects.
Operation
The operation of the Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections is anticipated to have 
minor adverse effects on geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology. However, where the stability of 
ground conditions is concerned, operation of the Power Generation Plant will result in a minor beneficial 
effect. 
Proposed Mitigation Measures 
All construction work will be conducted within best practice guidelines, and a detailed Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be employed to prevent any contamination or pollution 
incidents impacting on ground conditions. In respect of geology, ground conditions and agriculture, 
some mitigation could include;
l Minimising land take where possible; 
l Avoiding the need for piled foundations where possible;
l Dust suppression measures; and
l Following best practice guidance to minimise risk of spillages.
These mitigation measures would be detailed within the CEMP.
www.abergellipower.co.uk
Landscape and Visual Impacts
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the potential to impact 
upon landscape character and resources, designated landscapes, registered parks and gardens, 
recreational interests, and visual amenity.
Preliminary Information
The study area for the landscape and visual impact assessment has a radius of 15 km from the Project Site. A 
Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) has been prepared to identify the areas from which part(s) of the Project may 
be visible. This ZTV assumes that the highest part of the Project will be the stack and that the stack will have the 
maximum possible height of 45 m. The ZTV is shown below. A site visit has also been undertaken to assess any 
potential impacts upon the landscape. 
The Project Site lies within a valley which combined with the existing woodland and undulating topography 
provides a high degree of visual containment. Views from local roads are screened or filtered by hedgerows and 
earth banks. Views overlooking the Project Site from higher ground to the north and from more distant views to 
the south east near to the Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty would not experience significant effects 
due to the intervening distance, vegetation and built form. Where views of the upper parts of the Generating 
Equipment are visible in the middle distance of views, they would be seen in the context of the existing network 
of pylons and transmission lines, which are a similar height to the stack, as well as the tall structures present at 
the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and Swansea North Substation.
As a result, significant residual effects on the landscape and visual resource are localised and not extensive.
Power Generation Plant
The main visually prominent element of the Power Generation Plant is expected to be the 45 m-high stack. This 
represents a maximum height out of the possible range of 35 m to a 45 m stack and a 45 m stack has therefore 
been assessed as this represents the worst case scenario.. This vertical element is expected to have significant 
adverse effects on viewpoints 9, 14, 15, 16 and 17 (shown on the figure below) during construction and 
operation, as well as the landscape character of the Project Site. However, the emissions from the stack during 
operation will not produce a visible plume.
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are predominantly underground and are not expected to have 
significant effects during construction and operation. The reinstatement of the ground above underground 
infrastructure and screening of above ground infrastructure will be important in mitigating any potentially adverse 
effects and reducing the potential for residual impacts.
Mitigation Measures
A landscape mitigation strategy has been developed to both provide reinstatement planting as well as to 
integrate the Project into the landscape and its wider setting and is provided in the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report.
Next steps
During the consultation period, Abergelli Power will continue to liaise with the City and County of Swansea 
Council and Natural Resources Wales regarding potential additional viewpoints for the assessment. In addition, 
winter photography used for photomontages will be updated and included within the DCO Application.

Traffic, Transport and Access
The Project has the potential to impact upon the local transport network.
Proposed Access Route Options
In 2014, two possible route options for accessing the Project Site were under consideration. It has now 
been confirmed that Option B (see figure below) will be used. Option B extends the existing road to 
National Grid’s Swansea North substation, which is accessed via the B4489 to the west of the site.
The route of the new section of Access Road that will lead from the existing National Grid access to the 
Generating Equipment site is yet to be finalised and two options are under consideration (Options 1 and 
2) as shown on the figure below.
Preliminary information 
A preliminary assessment of the local road network has been undertaken to identify any potential 
impacts from the proposed Project. This assessment has taken into account both access route options.
The preliminary assessment of the potential impacts indicates that the construction period would have 
the largest impact in terms of traffic generation. During this period, there are expected to be slight to 
moderate increases in car, van and heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic levels, and slight disruption to the 
road network due to abnormal load deliveries and removals (such as large plant and equipment) at off-
peak times.
The study area (shown on the next figure) includes the Access Road between the Project Site and the 
B4489 and continues south to incorporate the M4 Junction 46 and the A48/Pant Lasau Road junction.
This baseline study area was selected to include the necessary junctions, key links, pedestrian routes 
(PRoWs, cycleways and footways), and Project access routes and these have been agreed with City 
County of Swansea Council
The key links are as follows:
l Link 1 – B4489, between the Access Road and the Felindre Park and Share facility;
l Link 2 – B4489, between the Felindre Park and Share facility and the M4 Junction 46;
l Link 3 – M4 eastbound on-slip;
l Link 4 – A48, between the northern and southern dumbbell roundabouts of the M4 Junction 46;
l Link 5 – M4 westbound off-slip;
l Link 6 – A48, between the M4 Junction 46 and the A48/Pant Lasau Road mini-roundabout;
l Link 7 – Pant Lasau Road;
l Link 8 – A48, southeast of the A48/Pant Lasau miniroundabout;
l Link 9 – B4489, south of the M4 Junction 46; and
l Link 10 – A48, southwest of the M4 Junction 46.

Construction and Decommissioning 
The peak traffic during construction is expected to result in approximately 200 car or van trips per 
day and around 150 HGV deliveries per day. This assumes a 22-month construction period, with the 
peak of HGV deliveries occurring during the first three months of the period and the peak of car and 
van trips occurring during months 13 to 15. The car or van trips would be limited to the start and end 
of the working day whilst HGV trips would be spread across the day. Decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant is expected to generate a similar or fewer number of vehicle movements.
The majority of the transport links within the assessment will experience minor adverse effects, which 
are not significant, other than those discussed below. 
Effects to Link 1 and the footpaths which cross within the Project Site Boundary are considered to be 
moderate due to pedestrian and user experience.
There was also found to be an increased delay on B4489 due to the Power Generation Plant which is 
considered minor adverse. 
There was found to be a reduced delay on M4 East Bound and West Bound Off-Slip which is considered 
to be an impact of minor benefit. This is as a result of changes in the balance of traffic flows at the 
junction, which will result in more gaps for traffic exiting from these arms as priorities are changed. This 
will result in a reduction in the level of delay of the arms benefitting from traffic flow balancing and an 
increase in arms which are forced to concede priority more than before flows were balanced.
Operation of the Power Generation Plant
During the operational period, it is anticipated that approximately three employees would be present on 
site during each shift. With such minimal operational traffic, the effects are considered to be negligible. 
Mitigation
Mitigation to minimise the effects of the construction, operational and decommissioning periods 
includes:
l  A Construction Traffic Management Plan, which could include aspects such as timing the arrival and 
departure of HGV traffic during off-peak times;
l  A Travel Plan to promote the use of sustainable transport among employees and reduce the number 
of vehicles on the road network; and
l  The agreement of abnormal load routing with the highways department of the City and County of 
Swansea Council and the South Wales Trunk Road Agency.
Next Steps 
Investigation is ongoing on the viability of both options for the new Access Road from the Substation 
to the Generating Equipment Site and therefore both are included within the Project Site boundary 
provided at this stage. APL intends to gain comments from interested parties and landowners in 
this regard and confirm the finalised option within the submitted Environmental Statement at DCO 
Application.
Study Area and Key Links
www.abergellipower.co.uk
Historic Environment
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project have the potential to 
impact upon heritage assets such as archaeological remains and the setting and appreciation of 
Heritage Assets such as Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments, Historic Park and Gardens and 
any other non-designated structure or building of cultural heritage importance. 
Preliminary Information
A preliminary desk-based assessment and site walkover has been undertaken to assess any potential effects upon 
heritage assets.
A 1 km study area for the desk based assessment of historic assets and consultation with City and County of 
Swansea Council, Cadw and Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust (GGAT) has been undertaken to inform the 
assessment. 
The setting assessment has considered designated Heritage Assets within 5 km from the Project Site. 
The assessment has found that the Project Site contains no historic assets although one Scheduled Monument, 
one Listed Building and 28 Non-scheduled Monuments are present within the 1 km study area. Within the 5 km 
study area for the assessment of setting, there are 16 Scheduled Monuments, 52 Listed Buildings (all grades), two 
Conservation Areas and three Registered Historic Parks and Gardens. 
Construction 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant and the Electrical Connection will not have a physical impact on 
any known historic assets. Therefore the effects during construction of the Power Generation Plant and Electrical 
Connection are not significant. 
Construction of the Gas Connection will not have a significant physical impact on any known historic asset, 
with the exception of where the Gas Pipeline crosses a small percentage of a historic field boundary, therefore 
requiring some removal. As this feature was already substantially altered when the preceding Oil Pipeline was 
installed, it is considered that little of the original historic fabric remains, and therefore the effect is considered to 
be negligible.
Operation 
No below ground disturbance is envisaged during the operational phase for any operational or maintenance 
activity, therefore there will be no further impact upon below ground archaeological remains once the Project is 
operational.
The Llansemlet Conservation Area, Penllergaer Park and Garden and several Listed Buildings lie within the 5 km 
study area for effects on setting. From these locations the stack may be visible. However, given the intervening 
landscape has been significantly developed, it is not anticipated that the Conservation Area, Park and Garden and 
Listed Buildings will be adversely affected by the Project.
It is anticipated that Project may be slightly visible from the Scheduled Ancient Monument (Mynydd Pysodlyn 
Round Barrow) and therefore is considered to have a minor adverse impact.
Mitigation Measures
Potential adverse effects will be limited by implementation of appropriate mitigation measures which will be 
devised with the relevant statutory consultees, and will likely include an archaeological watching brief to be 
carried out during construction. 
Next Steps
The assessment of the Project’s effects on the setting of historic assets is at an interim stage. The DCO Application 
will include winter photography, as well as additional viewpoints, to inform an updated assessment.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
STUDY AREA
LEGEND
Socio-Economics
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project have the potential to impact upon 
the labour market, community facilities and tourism.
Preliminary Information
A desk-based assessment has been undertaken to assess the potential impacts.
Socio-economic Study Area
The socio-economic study area is based on drive time catchment areas from the Project (as shown in the figure below).
l The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30-minute drive time; 
l The ‘wider area’ within a 45-minute drive time; and
l The ‘wider region’ within a 60-minute drive time. 
The socio-economic study area surrounding the Project is characterised by:
l An increasing population (2001-2017);
l Projected population increase of c.7% between 2017 and 2035;
l Slightly lower levels of unemployment comparable to the UK average;
l A higher proportion of people working in construction and manufacturing jobs;
l Above average levels of employment in electricity and gas related occupations;
l  A lower proportion of people working in high value professional, scientific and technical activities, and finance & 
insurance occupations;
l  A higher proportion of people employed in semi-skilled/unskilled jobs and lower proportion of people in highly skilled 
jobs; and
l  A higher proportion of people achieving no qualifications and low level qualifications compared to the UK average.
Tourism/Business Study Area
The tourism/business survey study area is limited to a 10 km radius of the Project. This is where the majority of impacts are 
anticipated. A desk based study was undertaken that identified a limited number of tourist attractions within the Project Site 
Boundary, which are: 
l The Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve; 
l National Cycle Route 43; and 
l Teamforce Paintball and Laser Tag Activity Centre.
Community Infrastructure Study Area
An initial audit of community facilities within 5 km of the Project Site indicates the provision of: 18 schools, five GP surgeries; 
one hospital; six dentists; six pharmacies; one park; and one library. The level of existing community infrastructure is 
considered to be sufficient to accommodate additional demand.
Conclusions 
Results of the preliminary assessment are that the Project will not have any significant adverse effects on tourism and 
recreation receptors; or on community infrastructure in the area during construction, operation or decommissioning. 
Beneficial employment effects can however be enhanced through linkages with job centres, colleges, employability 
programmes and engagement with local construction firms and other supply chain companies.
Next Steps
We are committed to providing community benefits through the development of Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) education, provision of skills and training opportunities and supporting a low carbon economy. We will 
continue to engage with City and County of Swansea Council to discuss options for delivering these through the existing 
Beyond Bricks and Mortar Scheme.

Need for Flexible Gas Generation
Nearly 45% of the country’s power already comes from gas, mostly generated by combined cycle gas turbine 
(CCGT) power plants. But while CCGT plants can deliver a steady supply of baseload power, they cannot turn on 
and be at full capacity at very short notice. Starting from cold to quickly power the equivalent of a small city in a 
matter of minutes rather than hours or days, however, is exactly what the UK power network is increasingly going 
to need.
Solar and wind power cannot generate electricity when it’s dark or still. So to facilitate more of these intermittent 
renewables coming onto the grid, we need sources that can be quickly ramped up to ‘fill the gaps’ when lower 
carbon technologies aren’t able to provide the essential power for the modern world. This is where Open Cycle 
Gas Turbine (OCGT) stations come in, alongside other standby technologies such as storage and demand side 
response.
OCGT stations have turbines that work like jet engines. This means they can start up incredibly quickly, getting to 
full load in just 30 minutes, meeting surges quickly when intermittent renewables cannot. They also complement 
nuclear, biomass and CCGT power stations that are already providing baseload electricity. 
l  By early next decade all of the UK’s coal-fired power stations and some older gas fired plant will have closed 
due to the EU Industrial Emissions Directive. 
l  Similarly, a large number of the UK’s nuclear power stations will close having already been given large 
extensions to their predicted lifespan.
l  Renewable energy technologies are fundamental to the UK’s decarbonisation strategy, however they cannot 
provide the security of supply that is currently provided by ageing coal-fired, gas-fired and nuclear plants.
l  The future for new nuclear power stations in the UK is uncertain and no new plant are expected to be 
operational until late next decade.
l  Carbon Capture and Storage remains an unproven technology with no plants expected to be available in the 
foreseeable future.
Government Policy
The overarching National Policy Statement (NPS) for Energy is NPS EN-1, which sets out national policy and 
explains the need for energy infrastructure.
NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas-fired generation. It confirms that a diverse energy mix is 
required and that there is a significant need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace capacity that will 
be lost through the closure of large existing plants. Such government policies highlight the general need for new 
gas-fired generation and projects like our own.

About Drax Group
Drax Group plc is a British owned and operated energy company headquartered in North 
Yorkshire that generates seven per cent of the country’s electricity. We employ around 
2,300 people and support over 18,500 jobs across our UK supply chain. 
We are involved in three principal activities:
l Generating electricity in power stations;
l Supplying electricity and gas to British businesses; and
l Manufacturing sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Abergelli Power project is an important part of our strategy to build a flexible, reliable and 
affordable energy system that can complement the increasing amount of weather dependent wind and 
solar power generation.
We are experts in building and operating power stations. Drax Power Station, the largest in the country, 
has been providing electricity to the national grid since the 1970s. In recent years the power station 
has been upgraded, on-time and on-budget, to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal, making it 
Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and the country’s single largest source of renewable power.
We know from experience that energy companies play an important role in the areas in which they 
operate. We aim to make a real, positive difference to the lives of the people living and working in our 
communities. We promise to work hard to ensure we’re being a responsible neighbour.
