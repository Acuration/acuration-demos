Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey within 150 ha of pastoral 
farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in 2014, to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant.  
1.3 
Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site 
at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops 
were made to listen and scan for singing and calling birds. The Survey Site was visited on three 
occasions, once during each of April, May and June. A constant search effort was employed during 
each survey visit, with all habitat types being approached to within approximately 50 m.  
1.4 
Nine bird species of principal importance for nature conservation’ as referred to in S42 of the 
NERC Act 2006 (S42)1 (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia dunnock 
Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer domesticus, linnet Carduelis cannabina, lesser redpoll 
Carduelis cabaret, skylark Alauda arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, and tree pipit Anthus 
trivialis) were considered likely to breed on site. All nine S42 species recorded within the Survey 
Site are also red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009), with the exception 
of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch Pyrrhula 
pyrrhula, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, reed bunting Emberiza 
schoeniclus, common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, whitethroat Sylvia communis and willow 
warbler Phylloscopus trochilus were also considered to have bred. 
1.5 
No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended) (Schedule 1 species) were recorded, although two Schedule 1 species were recorded 
during the surveys, as follows. A pair of red kite Milvus milvus was recorded mobbing a peregrine 
falcon Falco peregrinus over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station land during survey in May. A 
pair of kites was also recorded flying over the eastern boundary in the northern compartment of the 
Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the timing of the records, and that at least one pair 
were recorded during survey it is likely that red kite breed locally but that the single record of 
peregrine referred to a transient bird. No evidence was found to suggest breeding of either species 
occurred within the Survey Site during 2014. 
                                                      
1 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) required the Welsh Assembly Government 
(WAG), based on advice from the Countryside Council for Wales (now part of Natural Resources Wales), to identify 
species and habitats of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales.  Section 42 of The NERC Act 
requires the WAG to take steps to “further the conservation” of these species/habitats.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey to 
inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description  
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 and is centred at National Grid Reference 
265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 km to the 
north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within the Survey Site.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecological survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including a breeding bird survey.  These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix 
to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The survey work undertaken at Abergelli Farm between April and June 2014 aimed to establish: 
 
The number of species present on the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat; 
 
The number of territories held by each species, and 
 
Whether the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat is used by bird species of high 
conservation interest, including: 
a. 
Species protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended); 
b. 
Species listed on Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of 
Wild Birds; 
c. 
Species listed in Section 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(NERC 2006) as species of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in 
Wales; 
d. 
Species listed in the Swansea Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP); and 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Breeding Bird Survey Report

10/03/2015 
e. 
Species listed as having a Red or Amber population status2 (RSPB, 2009). 
 
                                                      
2 Seven quantitative criteria are used to assess the population status of each bird species and to categorise it on the red, 
amber or green list of conservation concern (species that are red-listed are of greatest conservation concern whereas 
those that are green-listed are not considered to be of particular conservation priority or (in a few cases) have insufficient 
data to be robustly categorised). Criteria considered are: global conservation status; evidence of recent decline; evidence 
of historical decline; an unfavourable European conservation status; rarity (in terms of breeding numbers); restricted 
(localised) distribution; and whether a species is considered to be of international conservation importance (featuring in 
the list of birds in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive 1979).  When considering whether a species is added to the red or the 
amber list, factors such as the extent of decline and range contraction are considered.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on designated sites was 
requested from within 10 km for European sites, 5 km for nationally designated sites and 2 km of 
the Survey Site for non-statutory sites. The latter search radius was also used for information on 
protected3 or notable species (particularly those identified as S42 species and/or of local 
conservation importance or LBAP4 species), including birds. In addition, an initial study of on-line 
aerial photographs, topographical, and Ordnance Survey maps was made using web-based 
resources including: Where’s the path?5, Google Maps6 and Google Earth Version 6 (Google Inc, 
2010). This, together with the results from a preliminary ecological appraisal7 carried out in 
February 2014 and updated in April 2014, resulted in a detailed understanding of the habitats and 
features on the Survey Site along with an indication of the bird community potentially present. 
Field Survey 
3.2 
The method used was adapted from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Common Bird Census 
(CBC) as described by Gilbert et al. (1998), Although eight to ten visits are usually undertaken for 
CBC sites being monitored over the long term, it is generally accepted that for the purposes of 
assessing potential environmental impacts, three visits are sufficient to describe the value of a 
Survey Site for breeding birds and give an approximation of the number of breeding bird territories 
present within a Survey Site (e.g. SNH, 20058). Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along 
field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be 
located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops were made to listen and scan for singing and 
calling birds.  All habitat features were approached to within approximately 50 m, except in horse 
pasture fields. Transects were not walked across closely grazed pasture fields, as it was possible 
to easily view birds by scanning from field boundaries (due to the lack of vegetation and small field 
sizes) and to avoid disturbing horses that were kept in many of them at the time of the survey. Bird 
locations were mapped using standard two-letter British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) codes, and 
bird activity was recorded using standard BTO behaviour codes (Marchant 1983).  
3.3 
The breeding status of birds recorded was categorised as either ‘holding territory’ or ‘showing other 
evidence of breeding’. Birds presumed to be holding territory were those recorded in song. Other 
evidence of breeding included observations of: 
 
Distraction display or injury feigning; 
 
Used nests or eggshells found (occupied or laid within the survey period); 
 
Recently fledged young or downy young; 
 
Adults entering or leaving a nest site in circumstances indicating an occupied nest or an adult 
sitting on nest; 
 
Adults carrying food for young or faecal sacs; 
 
Nest containing eggs; and 
 
Nest with young seen or heard. 
3.4 
The presence of house sparrow near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for 
breeding in this species.

3.5 
The results of the three breeding bird territory mapping surveys were combined to create a single 
map showing all birds considered to be holding territory (Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1). BTO 
codes for each species illustrated in Figure 1a and 1b are provided in Table 2 (below). Where a 
bird was observed in the same location during more than one survey visit, and this is judged to be 
the same individual bird, only one registration of that bird is shown on the map. Where more than 
one individual of the same species is shown in close proximity, these are individual birds seen 
simultaneously during a single survey. Note the locations of presumed territories do not represent 
specific nest locations. 
3.6 
The Survey Site was divided into two survey compartments due to its size; the first covered the 
north of the Survey Site (the land north of the gallops that runs from the houses at Abergelli Farm 
to the south-east corner of the Survey Site), and the second covered the south of the Survey Site 
(the land south of the gallops).  Three survey visits were made to each compartment; one in each 
of late April, late May and mid-June.  Table 1 below provides details of the duration and weather 
conditions during surveys.

3.7 
The Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the National Grid electrical substation compounds to the 
south-west of the Survey Site were not entered, due to lack of access. The compounds can be 
viewed adequately from the fence and there is very little suitable habitat for breeding birds within 
these compounds. The land immediately beyond the northern and eastern Survey Site boundaries 
was also not entered. The surveyor(s) scanned areas of adjacent habitat by walking paths and field 
edges and made use of local vantage-points to record species present around the access 
restricted areas. This enabled the entire site to be sampled without trespassing. 
3.8 
In late June, all buildings within the Survey Site, with the exception of those within the National Grid 
compounds referred to above, were inspected for barn owl Tyto alba presence or other evidence of 
presence, such as pellets, nests, or faecal matter. The buildings were primarily visited to inspect for 
bat roosts and the methods are described in detail in the bat roost inspection report. Anecdotal 
evidence from the land owner prior to inspection suggested that none of the buildings were in use 
or had historically been used by barn owl. All trees within the Survey Site were also inspected from 
ground level for evidence of use by bats and barn owl. A sub-set of these trees were identified for 
further roped-access (tree-climbing) survey that involved internal and external inspection of these 
trees. Full details of these surveys are provided in the bat survey report. 
3.9 
The maps from the three visits were combined.  For species where definitive evidence of breeding 
was not obtained, professional judgement (based on a range of factors including knowledge of 
habitat requirements, local status and/or repeat sightings) was used to conclude whether breeding 
was likely.  A precautionary approach was taken, with species suspected to have bred being 
plotted as having done so. 
Survey Limitations 
3.10 
It was not possible to gain access to the access road to the south-west of the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations and also the land 
immediately surrounding these areas during the breeding bird surveys, as shown in Figure 1b. It is 
unlikely that this is a significant constraint to the surveys as the areas that could not be surveyed 
contain similar habitats to those within the areas that were surveyed and it is unlikely that they 
support any additional species that are protected or notable.

Results  
Desk Study Data 
4.1 
A full list of the European designated sites within 10 km, national statutory designated sites within 5 
km, and non-statutory designated sites within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary is provided in the 
preliminary ecological appraisal.  Sites that include a cited ornithological interest are described 
below. 
Statutory Sites of Nature Conservation Importance 
4.2 
Carmarthen Bay and the tidal estuaries that extend from it, approximately 7.2 km west of the 
Survey Site, has been afforded multiple designations and is referred to under the umbrella term 
European Marine Site (EMS9) which includes the Carmarthen Bay area and Estuaries Special Area 
of Conservation (SAC10), and the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA11). This area also 
contains a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar12). The boundaries of each of 
these sites are not contiguous but all fall within the EMS site. The details of each designation are 
provided below.  
4.3 
The Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar, located approximately 9.7 km west south-west of the Survey 
Site, is classified for large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that feed in the 
saltmarshes and on the intertidal mud and sand. 
4.4 
The SPA has been classified as it supports important overwintering populations of eleven migratory 
species of waterfowl and an assemblage of 34,962 wintering water fowl including common 
shelduck Tadorna tadorna, Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, northern 
pintail Anas acuta, shoveler Anas clypeata, Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, grey 
plover Pluvialis squatarola,  red knot Calidris canutus, dunlin Calidris alpina alpina, Eurasian curlew 
Numenius arquata, and common redshank Tringa totanus.  The SPA includes extensive areas of 
intertidal sand and mud-flats, large sand dune systems and the largest continuous area of 
saltmarsh in Wales. 
4.5 
The spring and autumn population of common redshank, and wintering population of northern 
pintail, Eurasian oystercatcher, and red knot are qualifying features for the Burry Inlet Ramsar 
designation. 
4.6 
The Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, located approximately 7.2 km to the west, is designated 
for its ‘Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time’, ‘Estuaries’, ‘Mudflats and 
sandflats not covered by water at low tide’, ‘Large shallow inlets and bays’, ‘Salicornia and other 
annuals colonising mud and sand’, and ‘Atlantic salt meadows’. 
Non-Statutory Sites 
4.7 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in detail in the preliminary ecological appraisal.  Three SINCs lie partially 
within the Survey Site boundary, of which two have cited ornithological interest. 
4.8 
Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which includes three fields that lie within the 
north-east corner of the Survey Site. The site is designated for its wet woodland and woodland with 
                                                      
9 The term ‘European Marine Sites’ (EMS) collectively describes Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) that are covered by tidal waters and protect some of our most important marine and coastal 
habitats and species of European importance. 
10 SACs are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive in order to conserve the 189 habitat 
types and 788 faunal species identified in Annexes I and II of the Directive (as amended).  They do not afford protection 
to birds directly (although are often subject to various other designations that do have an ornithological component and 
often offer protection to habitats of value to a range of bird species).   
11 SPAs are internationally important sites classified in accordance with Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild 
birds (commonly referred to as the Bird Directive).   
12 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

assemblage of ancient woodland indicator species, scrub, purple moor grass and rush pasture, 
lowland meadow, neutral grassland, scrub, reed bed and water course habitats.  Species of bird 
listed on the SINC form include sky lark, tree pipit, reed bunting, common kestrel Falco tinnunculus, 
herring gull Larus argentatus, red kite, house sparrow, common starling Sturnus vulgaris, song 
thrush and barn owl. It is unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.9 
Warn Garn Wen is also an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the 
western boundary of the Survey Site. The site is designated for purple moor grass and rush 
pasture, wet woodland, scrub and watercourse habitats. Species of bird listed on the SINC form 
include herring gull, lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus, house sparrow, stonechat Saxicola 
rubicola, common starling and song thrush. It is unclear what the status of these species on the 
SINC is. 
4.10 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary. Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Survey Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent 
to the southern tip of the proposed access route. Both have cited ornithological interest. 
4.11 
The Rhos Fawr SINC is designated for its woodland containing an assemblage of ancient 
woodland indicator species, scrub, purple moor grass and rush pasture, and neutral grassland 
habitats. Species of bird listed on the SINC form include tree pipit and common cuckoo Cuculus 
canorus. It is unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.12 
The Felindre Grasslands SINC is designated for its wet woodland and lowland mixed deciduous 
woodland, purple moor grass and rush pasture, and scrub habitats. Species of bird listed on the 
SINC form include northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis, tree pipit, lesser redpoll, common linnet, 
reed bunting, common kestrel, common snipe Gallinago gallinago, herring gull, house sparrow, 
green woodpecker Picus viridis, willow tit Poecile montanus, common bullfinch, water rail Rallus 
aquaticus, stonechat, Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola, common starling, song thrush, barn 
owl, and northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus. It is unclear what the status of these species on the 
SINC is. 
4.13 
Two additional SINCs have cited ornithological interest. These are; Penllergaer Forest, located 
approximately 1 km south-west of the Survey Site, and Penllergaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and 
Railway Line, located approximately 1 km south of the Survey Site. 
4.14 
The Penllergaer Forest SINC is designated for its range of woodland types, purple moor grass and 
rush pasture, reedbeds and watercourses.  Species of bird listed on the SINC form include 
Northern goshawk, common kingfisher Alcedo atthis, lesser redpoll, common cuckoo, lesser 
spotted woodpecker Picoides minor, common grasshopper warbler, common crossbill Loxia 
curvirostra, red kite, house sparrow, wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, green woodpecker, 
willow tit, common bullfinch, common starling and song thrush. It is unclear what the status of these 
species on the SINC is. 
4.15 
Penllegaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and Railway Line SINC is also designated for its range of 
woodland types, purple moor grass and rush pasture, scrub and watercourses. Species of bird 
listed on the SINC form include tree pipit, lesser redpoll, common bullfinch, and song thrush. It is 
unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.16 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. 
Species Data 
4.17 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the west of 
the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south west near 
Penllergaer Woods in 2000. The most recent record is from approximately 3.7 km north-west of the 
Survey Site in April 2013. An additional 5 records were provided for the last 10 years, the nearest 
of which was recorded in 2007, approximately 2 km south-west of the Survey Site,   
4.18 
A red kite was noted circling above a field in the north-west corner of the Survey Site and also over 
Abergelli Farm during the Phase 1 Survey in April 2014. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red 
kite between 1999 and 2013, the record nearest the Survey Site being approximately 150 m to the 
east.

SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew, northern lapwing and skylark.  A total of 63 records of 
lapwing were provided from between 2000 and 2009, all south of the Survey Site.  The closest of 
these records are located at the tinplate workings site near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 
km to the south-west of the Survey Site boundary.  There was one record of curlew from 2011, 
located at the Lliw Reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.20 
A full list of species, returned from the data search can be found in Table 3 in Appendix 2. 
Breeding Bird Survey (2014) 
4.21 
A total of 53 species were recorded on the Survey Site during the breeding bird survey in 2014. Of 
these, 46 were passerines (including near-passerines) and seven non-passerines. 
Breeding passerines 
4.22 
The bird community was passerine dominated. Those observed holding territories and considered 
to have bred on the Survey Site are presented in Table 2 below. A full list of species, including non-
breeding birds, recorded during the breeding bird survey can be found in Table 4 in Appendix 2.

13 The number of territories where other evidence was found to confirm breeding is indicated. Other evidence of breeding 
was considered to include observations of adults carrying nesting material or food, adults being repeatedly alarmed or 
engaging in territorial disputes, and families including juveniles accompanied by adults. The presence of house sparrow 
near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for breeding in this species.

Twenty eight species of passerine were noted holding breeding territories on the Survey Site. An 
additional two species, lesser redpoll and house sparrow, were observed showing other evidence 
of breeding. 
4.24 
No passerine species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended)14 were recorded. 
4.25 
Nine S42 species (cuckoo, dunnock, grasshopper warbler, house sparrow, linnet, lesser redpoll, 
skylark, song thrush, and tree pipit) were considered likely to breed on the Survey Site. All nine 
S42 species recorded within the Survey Site are also listed in the Swansea LBAP15, and are red-
listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB Undated), with the exception of dunnock 
(which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch, mistle thrush, meadow 
pipit, reed bunting, redstart, whitethroat and willow warbler were also considered to have bred. 
4.26 
Willow warbler was the most abundant breeding species on the Survey Site. Large numbers of 
territories were also held by other passerines typical of a lowland farmland mosaic habitat including 
chiffchaff, chaffinch, robin and wren. Of the S42 species recorded, dunnock and song thrush were 
most abundant, with territories widely distributed across the Survey Site. The abundance of willow 
warbler, dunnock and song thrush on the Survey Site may be attributed to the relatively wide-
ranging habitat preferences of these generalist species (and the tendency of the former two 
species to breed in scrub).  
4.27 
The presence of ground nesting species (skylark and meadow pipit) within the Survey Site reflects 
the fact that much of the Survey Site is grazed pasture. However, the distribution of these species 
was localised, only being recorded in the pasture fields in the north-west of the Survey Site. Other 
species recorded on the pasture habitat during survey in April include stonechat, for which two 
territories were recorded, and northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe which were likely to have 
been on passage and not remained to breed on site (see Incidental Records below). Stonechat and 
wheatear were not recorded during breeding bird surveys in May and June.  
4.28 
Grasshopper warbler was associated with marshy areas in the north-western part of the Survey 
Site which reflect the species’ breeding habitat preferences. The species was only recorded during 
survey in April. No further records were made during dusk bat surveys or moth trap surveys carried 
out on the Survey Site during 2014. All registrations of cuckoo were beyond the Survey Site 
boundary. These were recorded near Lletty’r Bugail, approximately 300 m north of the Survey Site 
and at Waun y Garn-wen, and approximately 100 m west of the Survey Site, during survey in April 
                                                      
14 Schedule 1 birds receive full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), In addition to the 
protection from killing or taking that all birds, their nests and eggs have under the Act, Schedule 1 birds and their young 
must not be disturbed at the nest. 
15 Based on the 2005 consultation draft of the Swansea LBAP. The forthcoming replacement to this plan will be expected 
to reflect Section 42 Species and Habitats more closely.

and near a pond, north of Cefn-betingau, approximately 100 m east of the Survey Site during 
survey in May.  
4.29 
House sparrow colonies were recorded at the barn north of Abergelli Farm during all survey visits 
and at the Abergelli Farm buildings during the survey in May and June. The individual count was 26 
during the visit in April, 20 during the survey in May and 18 during the survey in June. Therefore, 
the number of breeding pairs within the Survey Site is likely to be between nine and 13. 
4.30 
A family of lesser redpoll were observed in scrub bordering the marshy grassland to the west of the 
Survey Site during the survey in June. Two birds were also recorded in this area during the survey 
in April. No further evidence of breeding in this species was recorded. Observations of single 
individuals were made near the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National Grid electrical 
substation during survey in May and June. 
4.31 
Three tree pipit territories were recorded during survey. These were recorded immediately south of 
the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in May and around the fringes of marshy grassland in 
the western part of the Survey Site and in the scrub line on the north-east corner of the Survey Site 
in June. Tree pipit were recorded during all survey visits, with flocks of up to 14 observed over the 
marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site during survey work in May. A family of tree 
pipit were recorded on a field boundary in the south-east corner of the Survey Site in June. Two 
pairs of tree pipit were observed immediately south of the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in 
June. It is likely that these records are of breeding pairs. 
4.32 
Indicative central territory locations are shown on Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1. 
Non-Passerines 
4.33 
Red kite were recorded during surveys in April and May. A bird was noted flying over the houses at 
Abergelli Farm and over the pasture in the northern part of the Survey Site during the survey in 
April. Two red kites were recorded mobbing a peregrine falcon over the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station land during the survey in May. An apparent pair was also recorded flying over the eastern 
boundary in the northern compartment of the Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the 
timing of the records, and that at least one pair was recorded during the survey in May it is likely 
that red kite breed locally. However, no evidence was found to suggest breeding occurred within 
the Survey Site during 2014.  
4.34 
Red kite are listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
and Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds making it an 
offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb birds at, on or near an ‘active’ nest, or to directly 
threaten birds, such as deliberately kill or capture birds, destroy their nests or take their eggs. 
4.35 
A peregrine falcon was observed flying over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National 
Grid electrical substation during survey in May. There is limited suitable breeding habitat within the 
Survey Site for peregrine falcon, and therefore this species is only likely to visit the Survey Site to 
forage on an occasional basis. Electricity pylons within the Survey Site were scanned from the 
ground for the presence of peregrine (and corvid) nests. No evidence of crow nests, which are 
sometimes appropriated by peregrine were found. Peregrine falcon is listed under Schedule 1 Part 
1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). 
4.36 
It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, 
although no trees were found that appear, from a ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large 
cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy fields in the north-west and at the southern end 
of the Survey Site could provide habitat for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) 
given the thick, tussocky structure of some parts of the sward. There was no evidence that barn 
owl breed within the Survey Site, and are unlikely to have done so in the recent past due to lack of 
droppings in the buildings and anecdotal evidence to this effect from the landowner. No signs of 
barn owl presence were found during building inspections and no birds were recorded during the 
breeding bird surveys.

Incidental Records 
4.37 
Species recorded during other survey work in the bird breeding season but not recorded during 
breeding bird surveys are described below. 
4.38 
Ten male and two female wheatear were observed on the horse pasture in the northern part of the 
Survey Site during a bat transect recce on 24 April 2014, and were presumably transient migrant 
birds.  
4.39 
Young tawny owls Strix aluco were heard calling near the houses in the western part of the Survey 
Site during a moth survey on 16 June, with birds of unknown age heard during a second survey on 
13 August 2014. This suggests that tawny owl bred on the Survey Site in 2014, presumably in the 
woodland block immediately to the south-west of Abergelli Farm, although much of the woodland 
within the Survey Site is suitable nesting habitat for this species. No further observations of tawny 
owl were made. A goshawk (female) was observed flying over the Survey Site at dusk on 16 June, 
and a sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, was recorded roosting in a tree near the aforementioned 
houses on 13 August. 
4.40 
Red kite were observed flying over the marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site 
during a dormouse survey on 29 May, and near Abergelli Farm during bat transect surveys on 22 
May and 17 July 2014.Single red kites flying over the Survey Site were also recorded during Phase 
1 habitat surveys on 24 February 2014 and 14 April 2014. 
4.41 
A spotted flycatcher Muscicapa striata was recorded in the hedge-line near the two houses on 17 
June 2014. Spotted flycatcher is a S42 species of principal importance in Wales, is listed in the 
Swansea LBAP and is a red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009).
