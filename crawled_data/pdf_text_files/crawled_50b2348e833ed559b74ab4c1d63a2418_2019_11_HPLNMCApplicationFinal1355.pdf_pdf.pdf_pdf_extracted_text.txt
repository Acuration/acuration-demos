 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 
Hirwaun Power Limited ("HPL") of registered address 33, Cavendish Square, 
London, W1G 0PW, is the named undertaker in, and was the applicant for, 
The Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015 (statutory instrument 2015 No. 
1574), which was made on 23 July 2015. This was subject to the Hirwaun 
Generating Station (Correction) Order 2015 (SI 2015 No. 2070), made on 21 
December 2015 (both together referred to herein as the “Order”). 
1.2 
The Order was made pursuant to Sections 114, 115 and 120 of the Planning 
Act 2008 (the "2008 Act"), with the reasons for making the Order contained in 
the Secretary of State's letter dated 23 July 2015 bearing the Planning 
Inspectorate’s ("PINS") reference number EN010059. 
1.3 
The Order grants development consent for the construction, operation and 
maintenance of a generating station with a gross rated electrical output of up 
to 299 MWe comprising up to five gas turbine generators (“GTG”), up to five 
exhaust gas emission flue stacks and other development that is part of the 
generating station (referred to in the Order as the "authorised 
development").  The authorised development is described in Schedule 1 to 
the Order, split out into numbered works.   
1.4 
The Order also authorises the compulsory acquisition of land required for the 
authorised development, as well as land that is required to facilitate or is 
incidental to the authorised development (being land required for the 
generating station's gas pipeline connection, above ground installation and 
electrical connection).   
1.5 
The authorised development would be located on land at the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate, near Aberdare, South Wales. The entire project lies within 
the administrative boundary of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. 
The location of the authorised development is shown on the Power Generation 
Plant Land Plan (Revision 3, Document Reference 2.2) and the various 
components that comprise the authorised development are shown on the 
Works Plans (Figure 2) (Revision 3, Document Reference 2.3). 
1.6 
HPL has interests in the land subject to the Order, pursuant to an option 
agreement for that part of the Order land on which the authorised development 
is to be located and part of the gas connection. 
1.7 
HPL has not yet concluded the exact number of turbines that will be 
constructed (the Order permits between one and five GTGs). Nonetheless, 
through the procurement process for the purchase of the necessary 
equipment, it has become apparent that in order to construct the single GTG 
scenario, minor alterations need to be made to some of the parameters and 
locations of various structures consented by the Order.

1.8 
HPL hereby applies to the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 153 and 
paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 2008 Act to make changes to the Order that 
are not material (the "NMC Application").  The NMC Application is subject to 
the Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and Revocation of, Development 
Consent 
Orders) 
Regulations 
2011, 
as 
amended 
(the 
“Changes 
Regulations”). 
1.9 
Part One of this document sets out the non-material amendments to the Order 
sought by HPL and the rationale for doing so. Part Two explains why the 
changes that are requested have either a negligible or non-material effect 
upon the environment. 
1.10 
This document complies with Regulation 4 of the Changes Regulations.

PART ONE PROPOSED NON MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE ORDER  
 
CONSULTATION AND PROCESS AS DESCRIBED BY THE CHANGES 
REGULATIONS 
2.1 
HPL will submit a Consultation and Publicity Statement, confirming HPL's 
compliance with Regulations 6 and 7 of the Changes Regulations in respect 
of the NMC Application.  In summary, the following has, or is being, 
undertaken by HPL:   
2.1.1 
HPL notified PINS of the NMC Application on 30th June 2016.   
2.1.2 
HPL is publicising the NMC Application in South Wales Echo (being a 
newspaper local to the site of the authorised development) on 19th 
August 2016 and 26th August 2016, being two successive weeks.  
Copies of these notices will be included in the Consultation and 
Publicity Statement.   
2.1.3 
HPL sought the written consent of the Secretary of State pursuant to 
Regulation 7(3) of the Changes Regulations to consult a smaller body 
of consultees in respect of the NMC Application than would otherwise 
be required pursuant to Regulations 7(1) and (2) of the Changes 
Regulations. The request was sent to the Secretary of State on 11th 
July 2016, with the Secretary of State responding on 22nd July.  The 
Secretary of State's response, and list of consultees HPL is therefore 
required to consult, is contained in Appendix One to this document.   
2.1.4 
Accordingly, HPL is consulting those persons identified in the 
Secretary of State's response. A copy of the notices sent to these 
consultees will be included in the Consultation and Publicity 
Statement.

3.3 
 
3.4 
Schedule 2 contains the Requirements. Requirement 4 relates to Detailed 
Design, and stipulates that the authorised development must be carried out in 
accordance with: 
3.4.1 
the Works Plans;  
3.4.2 
the rights of way, streets and access plan (Revision 3, 
Document Reference 2.7); and

the parameters specified in Table 2 of Requirement 4. 
3.5 
Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Order, each numbered work identified in 
Schedule 1 of the Order must be situated within its corresponding numbered 
work area shown on the Works Plans.   These numbered work areas are 
maximum limits of deviation, therefore the numbered work can be situated 
anywhere within its numbered work area identified on the Works Plans.   
3.6 
The numbered works must then be constructed within the parameters set by 
Table 2 in Requirement 4.  For ease of reference, these parameters are 
replicated below:

PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE ORDER  
4.1 
The proposed changes to the Order, and why they are needed, are described 
below. 
4.2 
Change One: Parameters of the gas turbine generator (part of numbered work 
2A) 
4.2.1 
A structure known as a diffuser forms part of the gas turbine generator 
("GTG"). The exhaust gas system guides the exhaust gas from the 
GTG through the diffuser to the flue stack. It also acts as a noise 
insulator from noise emitted by the GTG. For the one GTG scenario, 
the parameters of the GTG contained in Schedule 1 of the Order need 
to be amended in order to accommodate the additional length created 
by the addition of the diffuser element of the GTG. 
4.2.2 
In addition, a lube oil system is also attached to the GTG. This 
increases the width of the GTG by an additional 10 metres. This 
lubrication system, complete with tank, pumps, coolers, filters, valves 
and various control and protection devices, furnishes normal 
lubrication and absorption of heat rejection load of the gas turbine. 
Lubricating fluid is circulated to the three main turbine bearings, 
generator bearings, and to the turbine accessory gear and fuel pump. 
Also, lubricating fluid is supplied to the starting means torque 
converter for use as hydraulic fluid as well as for lubrication. 
Additionally, a portion of the pressurized fluid is diverted and filtered 
again for use by hydraulic control devices as control fluid. 
4.2.3 
In summary, for the one GTG scenario only, there is a need to 
increase the length of the GTG from a maximum of 30 metres to 50 
metres to accommodate the diffuser system elements of the GTG and 
the width from a maximum of 30 metres to 40 metres to accommodate 
the lube oil system.  This would involve a change to Table 2 in 
Requirement 4, Schedule 2 of the Order.  However, there would be 
no change in the overall footprint of the Power Generation Plant as 
show in Figures 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report (see Appendix 
Two). 
4.2.4 
This change is non-material because:  
 
(a) 
Whilst there would be an increase in the footprint of the GTG 
in the one GTG scenario, the footprint of each GTG in the five 
GTG scenario would not increase.  The footprint of the single 
GTG would therefore still be smaller overall than the five GTG 
scenario.  
(b) 
Figures 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report show the 
proposed single GTG scenario and the proposed changes.  
 
 
9 
 
The screening exercise set out in Chapter 4 of the 
Environmental Report identifies the potential for a change in 
the environmental effects predicted in the Environmental 
Statement (“ES”) for landscape and visual effects and air 
quality. The updated assessment for air quality (Chapter 6 of 
the Environmental Report) has concluded that overall, the 
Project, with the proposed changes, will continue to have a 
negligible likely impact on air quality in relation to both human 
and ecological receptors during construction, operation and 
decommissioning. This applies both for the Project alone and 
in combination with other proposed facilities in the vicinity of 
the Project site.  
(c) 
The updated assessment for landscape and visual effects 
(Chapter 5 of the Environmental Report) has concluded that 
the potential significance of effects associated with the 
proposed changes are no greater than those previously 
assessed for the approved Project. No significant landscape 
effects are predicted to arise at operation. There would be no 
material change to the character of the view from the ES 
viewpoint locations that relate specifically to the Power 
Generation Plant. The magnitude and significance of impact 
would be lower than for the realistic worst case (five GTG 
scenario) reported in the ES. No significant visual effects are 
predicted to arise at operation. Potential cumulative 
landscape or visual effects in relation to the Power Generation 
Plant site would be the same as the original ES. 
 
 
4.3 
Change Two: Parameters of the Flue Stack (part of numbered work 2A) 
4.3.1 
The flue stack consists of a lower and an upper stack section. For the 
single GTG scenario, the lower section, being that part of the flue 
stack up to a height of 16.5 metres, is thicker (and therefore wider) 
than the upper section of the flue stack. This is because the lower 
stack section consists of greater layers of casing, which is self-
supporting, and insulation.   
4.3.2 
At present, the Order does not account for this difference in width 
between the two sections of the flue stack.   Accordingly, there is a 
need to increase the width of the flue stack from 10 metres to 11 
metres up to a height of 16.5 metres for the single GTG scenario.  This 
would involve a change to Table 2 in Requirement 4, Schedule 2 of 
the Order.   
4.3.3 
This change is non-material because:  
 
 
10 
 
(a) 
The visible stack height and width from each of the key 
viewpoint locations that relate specifically to the Power 
Generation Plant does not change.  
(b) 
Figures 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report show the 
proposed single GTG scenario and the proposed changes.  
(c) 
The screening exercise set out in Chapter 4 of the 
Environmental Report identifies the potential for a change in 
the environmental effects predicted in the ES for landscape 
and visual effects, and air quality. An updated assessment for 
air quality (Chapter 6 of the Environmental Report) has 
concluded that overall, the Project, with the proposed 
changes, will continue to have a negligible likely impact on air 
quality in relation to both human and ecological receptors 
during construction, operation and decommissioning. This 
applies both for the Project alone and in combination with 
other proposed facilities in the vicinity of the Project site. 
(d) 
An updated assessment for landscape and visual effects 
(Chapter 5 of the Environmental Report) has concluded that 
the potential significance of effects associated with the 
proposed changes are no greater than those previously 
assessed for the approved Project. No significant landscape 
effects are predicted to arise during operation. There would 
be no material change to the character of the view from the 
ES viewpoint locations that relate specifically to the Power 
Generation Plant. The assessed magnitude and significance 
of impact would be lower than the realistic worst case (five 
GTG scenario) reported in the ES. No significant visual effects 
are predicted to arise at operation. Potential cumulative 
landscape or visual effects in relation to the Power Generation 
Plant site would be the same as the original ES.  
4.4 
Change Three: Black Start Diesel Generator (part of numbered work 2B) 
4.4.1 
The application for the authorised development assessed a realistic 
worst case solution, which involved an assessment of up to five GTGs. 
4.4.2 
As one GTG is larger in capacity than the individual capacity of, say, 
five smaller GTGs, more than one black start diesel generator would 
be required to start up a generating station with a single GTG.  Where 
two or more GTGs are constructed, as the GTG would be smaller in 
capacity, a single black start diesel generator can be used to start 
each GTG individually. In total, three black start diesel generators 
would be needed in the single GTG scenario only.  However, there 
would be no change in the overall footprint of the Power Generation 
Plant as shown in Figures 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report. 
 
 
11 
 
4.4.3 
The size of the black start diesel generator is also slightly longer than 
originally predicted; the length of each generator is 4 metres longer, 
meaning that the parameters need to increase from 13 metres to 17 
metres.  This applies to all GTG scenarios.   
4.4.4 
In summary: 
(a) 
in the single GTG scenarios only, the number of black start 
diesel generators needs to increase from one to three. This 
would involve an amendment to Schedule 1 of the Order; and  
(b) 
in all GTG scenarios, the size of the black start diesel 
generators needs to increase in length from 13 metres to 17 
metres.  This would involve a change to Table 2 in 
Requirement 4, Schedule 2 of the Order.  
4.4.5 
This change is non-material because:  
(a) 
The increase in the number of black start generators with the 
single GTG scenario compared to the single generator with 
the five GTG scenario means that the footprint of the black 
start generators will increase.  However, due to other 
changes, the overall area of the Power Generation Plant will 
not increase.  
(b) 
Figures 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report show the 
proposed single GTG scenario and the proposed changes.  
(c) 
The screening exercise set out in Chapter 4 of the 
Environmental Report identifies the potential for a change in 
the environmental effects predicted in the Environmental 
Statement.  No change in impacts is predicted as a result of 
these changes for each of the environmental topics 
considered. In respect to air quality there will be no change in 
emissions as a result of the change which will also not affect 
any ecological receptors.  There will be no change in noise 
and vibration levels.  The change will not affect any heritage 
assets. 
(d) 
The proposed changes to the black start diesel generators are 
not considered to affect landscape or visual impacts given 
they are low level structures (5 metres) and would be 
screened by the existing buildings and vegetation at Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate (see Chapter 5 of the Environmental Report). 
4.5 
Change Four: Natural gas receiving station and gas treatment compound (part 
of numbered work 2B) 
4.5.1 
Whilst the Natural Gas Receiving Station and Gas Treatment 
Compound can be constructed as part of the prescribed parameters 
 
 
12 
 
of the Order set out in Table 2 of Requirement 4 of Schedule 2 to the 
Order, there is a requirement for there to be a separation distance 
between the various filter mechanisms to allow a flow of natural gas.  
The separation distance is required between the natural gas receiving 
station and the gas treatment compound. The buffer volume is 
provided in the gas piping downstream of the gas receiving station to 
ensure a smooth switch-over to the stand-by regulator within the 
allowable pressure gradients, should the safety shut off valve or the 
operating regulator close. 
4.5.2 
The gas treatment compound with the block and vent valve needs to 
be positioned as close as possible to the GTG, in order to reduce the 
piping between the final filter and the GTG.   
4.5.3 
For all GTG scenarios, two smaller compounds, rather than one larger 
compound, are therefore needed in order to accommodate the 
separation of the natural gas receiving station from the gas treatment 
compound. 
4.5.4 
The total area for the compound currently consented by the Order is 
50 metres x 46 metres; a total of 2300 square metres. 
4.5.5 
The dimensions for two smaller compounds add up to 2,264 square 
metres in total, with the following dimensions: 
(1) Compound 1 – Natural Gas Receiving Station (5 metres (height), 
50 metres (length) and 36 metres (width)); 
(2) Compound 2 – Gas Treatment Compound (5 metres (height), 29 
metres (length) and 16 metres (width)). 
4.5.6 
This would involve a change to Table 2 in Requirement 4, Schedule 2 
of the Order.   
4.5.7 
This change, therefore, involves a reduction in the built footprint.   
4.5.8 
This change is non-material because:  
(a) 
The natural gas receiving station and gas treatment 
compound will have a smaller overall footprint than the 
footprint permitted in the Order.  
(b) 
Figures 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report show the 
proposed changes.  
(c) 
The screening exercise set out in Chapter 4 of the 
Environmental Report identifies the potential for a change in 
the environmental effects predicted in the Environmental 
Report. No change in impacts is predicted as a result of these 
changes for each of the environmental topics considered.  
 
 
13 
 
(d) 
The proposed changes to the natural gas receiving station 
and gas treatment compound are not considered to affect 
landscape or visual impacts given they are low level 
structures (5 metres) and would be screened by the existing 
buildings and vegetation at Hirwaun Industrial Estate (see 
Chapter 5 of the Environmental Report). 
4.6 
Change Five: Fin fan cooler (part of numbered work 2E(k)) 
4.6.1 
The realistic worst case scenario of five GTGs and five stacks 
at 35m assessed in the ES accounted for GTG cooling with a 
built in cooling system within each GTG. This design is 
common for smaller GTGs. Throughout the original ES, the 
assessment of the GTG considered the built-in cooling 
system.   
4.6.2 
For a single GTG, the cooling system is not contained within 
the GTG but is in a standalone structure (Fin Fan Cooler) to 
allow for a closed water cooling system and to transfer the 
heat produced by the generator coolers and the gas turbine / 
generator lube oil system via the fin fan cooler to the ambient 
air.  
4.6.3 
The Fin Fan Cooler required for the single GTG scenario 
would be 13m long, 10m wide and 6m high.  
4.6.4 
Even with a stand-alone Fin Fan Cooler, the total built 
footprint of the single GTG scenario is smaller than the larger 
consented five GTG scenario (see Figures 5 and 6 of the 
Environmental Report).    
4.6.5 
This would involve an amendment to Schedule 1 of the Order 
and a change to Table 2 in Requirement 4, Schedule 2 of the 
Order for the single GTG scenario. 
4.6.6 
This change is non-material because:  
    
(a) 
Whilst there would be an increase in the footprint of the GTG 
in the one GTG scenario, even with a stand-alone Fin Fan 
Cooler, the total built footprint of the single GTG scenario is 
smaller than the larger consented five GTG scenario (see 
Figures 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report).    
 
(b) 
Figures 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report show the 
proposed single GTG scenario and the proposed changes.  
The screening exercise set out in Chapter 4 of the 
Environmental Report identifies the potential for a change in 
 
 
14 
 
the environmental effects predicted in the ES for landscape 
and visual effects and air quality. The updated assessment for 
air quality (Chapter 6 of the Environmental Report) has 
concluded that overall, the Project, with proposed changes, 
will continue to have a negligible likely impact on air quality in 
relation to both human and ecological receptors during 
construction, operation and decommissioning. This applies 
both for the Project alone and in combination with other 
proposed facilities in the vicinity of the Project site.  
(c) 
The updated assessment for landscape and visual effects 
(Chapter 5 of the Environmental Report) has concluded that 
the potential significance of effects associated with the 
proposed changes are no greater than those previously 
assessed for the approved Project. No significant landscape 
effects are predicted to arise at operation. There would be no 
material change to the character of the view from the ES 
viewpoint locations that relate specifically to the Power 
Generation Plant. The magnitude and significance of impact 
would be lower than for the realistic worst case (five GTG 
scenario) reported in the Environmental Statement. No 
significant visual effects are predicted to arise at operation. 
Potential cumulative landscape or visual effects in relation to 
the Power Generation Plant site would be the same as the 
original ES. 
4.7 
Change Six: Switchyard/banking compound (numbered word 2C) 
4.7.1 
The numbered work areas shown on the Works Plans, and 
environmental assessment undertaken as part of the application for 
the authorised development, were based on a realistic worst case 
solution to accommodate up to five GTGs.  
4.7.2 
Should HPL opt for the single GTG scenario, this considerably 
reduces the overall size of the footprint of the Power Generation Plant. 
In the event that this option is constructed, economically and 
practically it is not logical to site the switchyard so far away from the 
GTG.  
4.7.3 
Therefore, it is proposed that the numbered work area for numbered 
work 2C for the switchyard and banking compound is extended to the 
eastern edge of the site, bringing the switchyard and banking 
compound closer to the development area of the single GTG. The 
parameters of the switchyard and banking compound remain 
unchanged.      
4.7.4 
The benefit of this change is that it would result in a tighter footprint 
for the generating station.   
4.7.5 
This change is non-material because:  
 
 
15 
 
(a) 
The footprint of the switchyard and banking compound is 
unchanged. The changes are to the layout of the Power 
Generation Plant Site (plant buildings/ancillary structures), 
rather than the Order Limits. 
(b) 
Figure 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Environmental Report show the 
proposed single GTG scenario and the proposed changes.  
(c) 
The screening exercise set out in Chapter 4 of the 
Environmental Report identifies the potential for a change in 
the environmental effects predicted in the Environmental 
Statement. No change in impacts is predicted as a result of 
these changes for each of the environmental topics 
considered. 
(d) 
This change would only affect structures that are of a lower 
height than the GTG and flue stack and in terms of visibility 
would be less noticeable from the viewpoints assessed in the 
ES and in the Environmental Report.  No changes are made 
to the proposed embedded and secondary landscape 
mitigation.

PART 2 ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT 
6.1 
The Environmental Report provides an overview of the potential impacts 
of the proposed changes and compares these to the original ES submitted 
to support the application for the Development Consent Order.  The 
following topics were screened out of requiring updated assessments as 
the proposed changes did not have the potential to result in any different 
effects to those identified in the original ES (the reasoning for this 
screening out is contained in Section 4 of the Environmental Report: 
 
Noise and Vibration; 
 
Ecology and Nature Conservation; 
 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology; 
 
Water Quality and Resources; 
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture; 
 
Traffic, Transport and Access; 
 
Socio-Economics; and 
 
Health and Waste.  
6.2 
Accordingly, the only environmental topics that have the potential to result 
in any different effects to those identified in the original ES are air quality 
and landscape and visual.  The outcome of the updated assessments for 
air quality and landscape and visual confirmed that the significance of the 
impact would be reduced or would not result in new of different likely 
significant environmental effects to those previously reported. It is 
therefore considered that the proposed changes would constitute non-
material changes.  Reference is made to the Environmental Report in 
Appendix Two for a complete explanation and justification for this 
conclusion.  
 
 
6.3 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS AND THE GUIDANCE 
6.4 
The proposed changes will not result in the need to acquire any additional 
land.  The screening assessment has confirmed that no update is required 
to the Habitat Regulations Assessment as there is no change to the 
impacts on any sites of European importance.   
 
 
22 
 
 
CONCLUSION  
7.1 
The outcome of the screening and updated assessments confirms that the 
conclusions in the Environmental Statement remain valid for the proposed 
changes.  The significance of the impact would be unchanged or reduced. 
It is therefore considered that the proposed changes are non-material 
amendments for the purposes of the Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, 
and Revocation of, Development Consent Orders) Regulations 2011.  
Accordingly, HPL submits that the proposed changes as outlined in 
section 4 of this Document can be consented by the Secretary as non-
material changes.

Dear Mr McKerrow 
 
 
RE: HIRWAUN POWER GENERATING STATION ORDER 2015 – PROPOSED 
NON-MATERIAL CHANGE APPLICATION 
 
Thank you for your e-mail message of 11 July 2016 to Gareth Leigh and Laura 
Allen with two attachments on behalf of Hirwaun Power Limited (“the 
Applicant”). It is noted that the attached documents consist of: i) a Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheet of the proposed consultees (highlighted in green) in respect 
of changes to the development consent order for the Hirwaun Power 
Generating Station; and ii) separate advice on this matter from the Planning 
Inspectorate of 7 July 2016.   
 
The Applicant has requested that the Secretary of State give written consent 
under regulation 7(3) of the Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and 
Revocation of, Development Consent Orders) Regulations 2011 (as amended) 
(“the 2011 Regulations”), such that the Applicant does not need to consult those 
persons specified and highlighted in red in the spreadsheet, as it is not 
considered they will be directly affected by them.  
 
The Secretary of State has considered the request and agrees that, with the 
exception of MOD Safeguarding and also Powys, Merthyr Tydfil and Caerphilly 
(who it is noted are listed in the spreadsheet as a “relevant local authority” 
within the meaning given by section 102(5) of the Planning Act 2008), the 
Applicant does not need to consult directly with those persons specified and 
highlighted in red in spreadsheet, as they will not be directly affected by the 
changes being proposed.  Accordingly, this letter is written consent under 
regulation 7(3) of the Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and Revocation of, 
 
 
Development Consent Orders) Regulations 2011 such that consultation under 
regulation 7 of those persons specified is not required.  
 
In taking this decision, the Secretary of State notes there will be public 
consultation on the proposals following submission of the application for non-
material changes to the Order in line with the requirements in regulation 20 of 
the 2011 Regulations.  
 
Finally, the Secretary of State`s consent in this matter should not be taken as 
indicating approval for any other aspects of the proposed changes to the  
Hirwaun Power Generating Station which fall to the Secretary of State for 
consideration and determination. 
 
Yours sincerely,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1.1
Hirwaun Power Limited submitted an application for Development Consent for the
Hirwaun Generating Station in March 2014. The Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
(the Development Consent Order) was made on 23 July 2015.  The Development
Consent Order grants consent for a gas-fired peaking plant with up to five gas turbine
generators on land on Hirwaun Industrial Estate, near Aberdare, South Wales.  The
Hirwaun Generating Station would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine peaking plant
and would be designed to provide an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts.
1.1.2
Following the grant of the Development Consent Order, Hirwaun Power Limited has
identified the following non-material, minor changes to the parameters of  the Power
Generation Plant element of the Hirwaun Generating Station:
à
Increase in size of the Gas Turbine Generator (relates to single Gas Turbine
Generator scenario only);
à Increase in width of flue stack at base (relates to single Gas Turbine Generator
scenario only);
à Increase the permitted number of black start diesel generators from one to three
(relates to single Gas Turbine Generator scenario only);
à Amend the permitted natural gas receiving station and gas treatment compound
so as to permit the construction of two separate smaller compounds (relates to all
Gas Turbine Generator scenarios);
à Include express reference to an external fin fan cooler (relates to single Gas
Turbine Generator scenario only); and
à
Amend the area for Work No 2C on the Works Plans in order to construct the
switchyard closer to the Gas Turbine Generator (relates to single Gas Turbine
Generator scenario only); and
à
Dimensions of black start diesel generator (relates to all Gas Turbine Generator
scenarios).
1.1.3
This report is submitted in support of a non-material change application under the
Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and Revocation of, Development Consent Orders)
Regulations 2011 (‘the Regulations’).  The report provides an overview of the potential
impacts of the proposed changes and compares these to the original Environmental
Statement (ES) submitted to support the application for the Development Consent Order.
The following topics were screened out of requiring updated assessments as the
proposed changes did not have the potential to result in any different effects to those
identified in the original ES (the reason for this screening out is explained later on in this
Report):
à
Noise and Vibration;
à

INTRODUCTION
2.1.1
Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL) submitted an application for Development Consent for the
Hirwaun Generating Station in March 2014. The Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
(Development Consent Order) was made by the Secretary of State on 23 July 2015.  The
Development Consent Order granted consent for a gas-fired peaking plant with up to five
gas turbine generators (GTG) on land on Hirwaun Industrial Estate, near Aberdare,
South Wales.  The Hirwaun Generation Station would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas
Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical output of
up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  The plant would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied to the
site by a new gas pipeline connecting the Power Generation Plant element of the
Hirwaun Generating Station to the existing National Gas Transmission System (NTS).
2.1.2
Following the granting of the Development Consent Order, HPL has identified some non-
material, minor changes to the parameters of elements of the Power Generation Plant
(as described in Chapter 3).
2.1.3
This report is submitted in support of a non-material change application under the
Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and Revocation of, Development Consent Orders)
Regulations 2011 (‘the Regulations’).  The report provides an overview of the potential
impacts of the proposed changes and compares these to the original Environmental
Statement (ES) submitted in support of the application for the Development Consent
Order (Parsons Brinckerhoff, March 2014) which reported the findings of the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
2.1.4
The original EIA considered a ‘realistic worst case scenario’ which was identified on a
topic by topic basis. All of the environmental topics assumed that five GTGs was the
realistic worst case scenario.
2.1.5
This report demonstrates that the potential impacts associated with the proposed
4

WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hiwaun Power Limited

changes would either be reduced or would not result in new or different likely significant
effects to those previously reported. The proposed changes can therefore be described
as non-material for the purpose of Part 1 of the Regulations.
2.1.6
The Report is supported by the results of an environmental screening exercise (Chapter
4) and updated assessments for landscape and visual impacts (Chapter 5) and air quality
(Chapter 6).

PROPOSED NON-MATERIAL CHANGES
3.1
INTRODUCTION
3.1.1
The proposed changes are shown on the following Figures:
à
Figure 1 – Site Plan;
à
Figure 2 – Gas Turbine Generator Plan;
à
Figure 4 – Black Start Generator Plan and Elevations;
à
Figure 5 – Gas Turbine Generator Overlay Plan; and
à
Figure 6 – Overlay Gas Turbine Generator, Black Start Generator and Fin Fan
Cooler Elevations.
3.2
PARAMETERS OF GAS TURBINE GENERATOR
3.2.1
A structure known as a ‘diffuser’ forms part of the GTG. The exhaust gas system guides
the exhaust gas from the GTG through the diffuser to the flue stack. It also acts as a
noise insulator from noise emitted by the GTG. For the single GTG scenario, the length of
the GTG needs to be increased by 20 metres in order to accommodate the additional
length created by the addition of the diffuser element of the GTG.
3.2.2
In addition, a lube oil system is also attached to the GTG. This increases the width of the
GTG by an additional 10 metres (from 30 metres to 40 metres). This lubrication system,
complete with tank, pumps, coolers, filters, valves and various control and protection
devices, furnishes normal lubrication and absorption of heat rejection load of the gas
turbine. Lubricating fluid is circulated to the three main turbine bearings, generator
bearings, and to the turbine accessory gear and fuel pump. Also, lubricating fluid is
supplied to the starting torque converter for use as hydraulic fluid as well as for
lubrication. Additionally, a portion of the pressurized fluid is diverted and filtered again for
use by hydraulic control devices as control fluid.
3.2.3
For the single GTG scenario only, there is a need to increase the maximum length of the
GTG from 30 metres to 50 metres to accommodate the diffuser system elements of the
GTG and the width from a maximum of 30 metres to 40 metres to accommodate the lube
oil system.

Hiwaun Power Limited

3.3
 PARAMETERS OF FLUE STACK
3.3.1
The flue stack consists of a lower and an upper stack section. The lower section, being
that part of the flue stack up to a height of 16.5 metres, is thicker (and therefore wider)
than the upper section of the flue stack. This is because the lower stack section consists
of greater layers of casing, which is self-supporting, and insulation.
3.3.2
The parameters set out in Requirement 4 of the Development Consent Order, did not
account for this difference.  Accordingly, for the single GTG scenario only, there is a need
to increase the width of the flue stack from 10 metres to 11 metres up to a height of 16.5
metres.
3.4
BLACK START DIESEL GENERATOR
3.4.1
As one GTG is larger in capacity than the individual capacity of, say, five smaller GTGs,
more than one black start diesel generator would be required to start up a generating
station with a single GTG.  Where two or more GTGs are constructed, as the GTG would
be smaller in capacity, a single black start diesel generator can be used to start each
GTG individually. In total, three black start diesel generators would be needed in the
single GTG scenario.  This requires a change to Schedule 1 of the Development Consent
Order (numbered work 2B).
3.4.2
The black start generator is used to start the GTGs in the event of a failure / blackout on
the National Grid Electricity System.
3.4.3
The size of the black start diesel generator is also slightly longer than originally predicted;
the length of each generator is 4 metres longer, meaning that the parameters need to
increase from 13 metres to 17 metres.  This applies to all GTG scenarios.  This requires
a change to Table 2 in Requirement 4 of Schedule 2.
3.4.4
In summary:
à
in the single GTG scenario only, the number of black start diesel generators
needs to increase from one to three; and
à
in all GTG scenarios, the size of the black start diesel generators needs to
increase in length from 13 metres to 17 metres.
3.5
NATURAL GAS RECEIVING STATION AND GAS TREATMENT COMPOUND
3.5.1
Whilst the final gas filter (which forms part of the of natural gas receiving station) can be
constructed as part of the prescribed parameters, there is a requirement for there to be a
separation distance between the various filter mechanisms to allow a flow of natural gas.
3.5.2
Two smaller compounds, rather than one larger compound, are therefore needed in order
to accommodate the separation of the natural gas receiving station and the gas treatment
compound.
3.5.3
The total area for the compound currently consented by the Development Consent Order
is 50 metres x 46 metres; a total of 2300 square metres.
6
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hiwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
3.5.4
The dimensions for two smaller compounds add up to 2,264 square metres in total, with
the following dimensions:
à
Compound 1 – Natural Gas Receiving Station (5 metres (height), 36 metres
(width) and 50 metres (length));
à
Compound 2 – Gas Treatment Compound (5 metres (height), 16 metres
(width) and 29 metres (length)).
3.5.5
This change, therefore, involves a reduction in the total built footprint.
3.6
FIN FAN COOLER
3.6.1
The realistic worst case scenario of five GTGs and five stacks at 35m assessed in the ES
accounted for GTG cooling with a built in cooling system within each GTG. This design is
common for smaller GTGs. Throughout the original ES, the assessment of the GTG
considered the built-in cooling system.
3.6.2
For a single GTG, the cooling system is not contained within the GTG but is in a
standalone structure (Fin Fan Cooler) to allow for a closed water cooling system and to
transfer the heat produced by the generator coolers and the gas turbine / generator lube
oil system via the fin fan cooler to the ambient air.
3.6.3
The Fin Fan Cooler required for the single GTG scenario would be 13m long, 10m wide
and 6m high.
3.6.4
Even with a stand alone Fin Fan Cooler, the total built footprint of the single GTG
scenario is smaller than the larger consented five GTG scenario (see Figures 5 and 6).
3.7
SWITCHYARD/BANKING COMPOUND
3.7.1
Should HPL opt for one GTG, this considerably reduces the overall size of the footprint of
the Hirwaun Generating Station (in that the single GTG scenario has a smaller footprint
even with the changes referred to herein than the five GTG scenario). In the event that
this option is constructed, economically and practically it is not logical to site the
switchyard in its current consented position, so far away from the GTG.
3.7.2
Therefore, it is proposed that the numbered work area 2C for the switchyard and banking
compound is extended to the eastern edge of the site, bringing the switchyard and
banking compound closer to the development area of the GTG. The parameters of the
switchyard and banking compound remain unchanged.
3.7.3
The benefit of this change is that it would result in a smaller footprint for the Hirwaun
Generating Station.

SCREENING
4.1
METHODOLOGY
4.1.1
All topics assessed in relation to the application for the Development Consent Order were
considered in terms of the proposed non-material changes (Chapter 3).  The following
steps were undertaken:
à
All topics and potential impacts assessed in the ES submitted in support of the
application for the Development Consent Order were screened against the
parameters of the proposed changes referred to in Chapter 3 above. This
included consideration of the environmental effects of the proposed changes
to the project and where these effects could result in a different significance of
effect to that identified in the original ES.
à
Where there was a clear case that the significance of the effect would be
unchanged or reduced, these topics were ‘pre-screened’ out of further
assessment.  The outcome of the pre-screening exercise is presented in
Table 4.1 of this Chapter 4.  In the case of landscape and visual impact, the
pre-screening exercise was informed by photomontages and an account is
provided in Chapter 5, which concluded that the five GTG scenario remained
the realistic worst case and therefore the assessment in the original ES
remains valid.
à
Where further analysis was required to determine whether the significance of
the effect would be unchanged or reduced, updated assessments have been
provided in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 of this Report.
à
A search of the National Infrastructure Planning register of applications and a
search of Rhondda Cynon Taff planning applications register has been
undertaken.  No new applications have been registered for Nationally
Significant Infrastructure Projects or major planning applications that would be
required to be considered in the assessment of cumulative effects.  There are
also no changes to the baseline information sufficient to require an update to
the cumulative assessment.
4.1.2
The majority of the proposed changes referred to in Chapter 3 relate only to the single
GTG scenario:
à
Changes in dimensions for the single GTG;
à
Width of flue stack;
à
Increase in number of Black Start Diesel Generators from one to up to three;
à
A stand alone Fin Fan Cooler;
à
Location of the Switchyard/Banking compound.
4.1.3
These proposed changes in the single GTG scenario have been screened and the

updated assessments undertaken in the context of whether the effects of the single GTG
scenario would be different to those identified in the realistic worst case scenario
identified in the ES for all environmental topics, being the five GTG scenario.
4.1.4
The following proposed changes referred to in Chapter 3 relate to all GTG scenarios:
à
Dimensions of Black Start Diesel Generator; and
à
Creating two compounds out of the single compound for the Natural Gas
Receiving Station and Gas Treatment Compound.
4.1.5
These proposed changes have been considered in the context of the five GTG scenario
and whether or not they would create different environmental effects to those identified in
the ES.

4.2.2
The following sections provide further commentary on the topics in Table 4.1
NOISE
4.2.3
As part of the original EIA, the Power Generation Plant was modelled based on a site
layout utilising five No. air cooled, 59MW single cycle gas turbines and associated plant.
Each turbine was modelled with a 30m high exhaust stack with a sound power level of
110 dB (Lw A) at the stack termination when running at base load. The predicted noise
levels based on this configuration formed the noise limits for the Power Generation Plant
as set out in the Requirements contained in the Development Consent Order
4.2.4
An alternative site layout and configuration is being considered, using fewer, but higher
power rated turbines, which would be enclosed within a single engine house with a single
exhaust stack.  A manufacturer of this type of unit has confirmed that the alternative
configuration will be able to meet the noise limits contained in the Development Consent
Order, as noise from the GTG units is attenuated by the turbine casing, and so varies
little with higher power output turbines. The main variable noise producing element is
likely to be exhaust noise through the top of the stack. If a single exhaust stack is used,
then the sound power level at the stack termination should not exceed 113 dB (Lw A)
when running at base load.
4.2.5
Regardless of the plant configuration, the following embedded mitigation will be applied
to minimise noise:
à
The GTGs and major compressors are to be housed in individual acoustic
enclosures specified at 85 dB(A) Sound Pressure Level at 1 m.
à
Turbine filter and ventilation apertures are to be fitted with high performance
silencers, and designed such that all sensitive receptors benefit from
screening and/or directivity corrections.
à
High performance silencers will be installed in the outlet duct(s) between the
GTGs. Due to the impracticality of screening stack noise, discharge noise will
be controlled using silencers tuned to attenuate low frequencies from the GTG
exhausts.
à
Unit transformers and generator transformers to be housed in an appropriate
enclosure or three sided pen, to provide full screening to noise sensitive
receptors.
à
All plant items will be controlled to minimise noise of an impulsive or tonal
nature, such that the rating level as defined in BS 4142:2014 is equal to the
specific noise level.
4.2.6
It is confirmed that in the proposed changes in the single GTG scenario and the
proposed changes in all GTG scenarios (as outlined in paragraphs 4.1.2 and 4.1.4
above) are not likely to result in any changes to the predicted noise effects as assessed
in the ES.  In any event, the proposed changes can all be accommodated within the
noise restrictions set out in Requirement 15 of the Development Consent Order.
4.2.7
Therefore, there are no new or materially different likely significant effects from those set
17
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
out in the ES.
CULTURAL HERITAGE
4.2.8
The proposed changes are to the layout of the Power Generation Plant Site (plant
buildings/ancillary structures), rather than a change to the Order Limits.
4.2.9
Accordingly, given the Order Limits have been assessed in the ES, it is confirmed that in
the proposed changes in the single GTG scenario and the proposed changes in all GTG
scenarios (as outlined in paragraphs 4.1.2 and 4.1.4 above) are not likely to result in any
changes to the predicted effects on cultural heritage as assessed in the ES.
4.2.10 The remains of the WWII Royal Ordnance Factory lie within the Power Generation Plant
Site. This includes the remains of standing buildings and the potential for below ground
archaeology. This is the case with or without the proposed changes.  There is, therefore,
no change to the impact assessment for the effects of the Scheme on this or any other
non-designated asset. There is also no change to the predicted direct impact on the
setting of the non-designated or designated heritage assets. This applies during both
construction and operation.
4.2.11 Accordingly, there is no change to the mitigation proposed, which is secured via
Requirement 11 of the Development Consent Order.
ECOLOGY
4.2.12 The proposed changes are to the layout of the Power Generation Plant Site (plant
buildings/ancillary structures), rather than the Order Limits. Of relevance to this
assessment is the moving of the switchyard/banking compound from the western extent
of the Order Limits in the single GTG scenario creating a much more compact Power
Generation Plant area, the widening of the stack in the single GTG scenario, the addition
of the stand alone fin fan cooler in the single GTG scenario and the increase in number
of black start generators in the single GTG scenario.
4.2.13 The splitting of the natural gas receiving station and gas treatment compound will not
result in any changes to the predicted effects on ecological receptors as it will not affect
emissions and is therefore not relevant to the assessment.
4.2.14 As part of the original assessment for ecology, predicted impacts and effects (without
mitigation) of project activities to ecological receptors included:
à
Permanent and temporary habitat loss (within the Order Limits);
à
Habitat fragmentation (dependent on receptor, but predominantly within the
Order Limits);
18
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
à
Incidental mortality of species during site clearance and construction (within
the Order Limits);
à
Direct and indirect disturbance from construction activities including visual,
noise, vibration and lighting (up to several hundred metres, dependent on
receptor);
à
Pollution caused by dust (up to 100m from works footprint);
à
Pollution caused by use of hazardous materials and incidental release of
chemicals, fuels or waste materials (dependent on pathway, effects on
hydrologically connected receptors could potentially occur several kilometres
downstream); and
à
Changes in hydrology from construction of the Power Generation Plant.
4.2.15 No changes to areas of permanent and/or temporary habitat loss will occur as a result of
the proposed changes outlined in paragraphs 4.1.2 and 4.1.4 above.  The original
assessment assumed temporary land-take of all areas within the redline boundary.  As
the redline boundary remains the same, no changes to habitat fragmentation or incidental
mortality of species is likely to occur.
4.2.16 Results of the revised air quality assessment shows that the emissions resulting from the
proposed single GTG dimensions and single turbine outputs would be reduced compared
to the original assessment of five turbine units. Marked reductions in annual mean and
daily mean nitrogen oxides are predicted over all of the sites designated for nature
conservation, including Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and its
supporting features in the Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of Importance for Nature
Conservation (SINC).  The impact of the proposed changes on nitrogen deposition would
also be reduced.
4.2.17 The Habitat Regulations Screening Assessment (No Significant Effects Report submitted
with the original application) has considered the potential for Likely Significant Effects on
the SAC sites to occur, either alone or in combination with other developments and the
assessment has identified that Likely Significant Effects, either alone or in-combination
with other developments, are unlikely.  The Air Quality Assessment and Water Quality
and Resources Assessment of the ES underpinned the No Significant Effects Report.
None of the proposed changes are relevant to water quality and the updated air quality
assessment has concluded that the impacts would be unchanged or reduced.  The
outcome of the screening and updated assessments confirms that the conclusions in the
ES remain valid and therefore the findings of the No Significant Effects Report also
remain valid for the proposed changes.
OTHER TOPICS
4.2.18 As set out in Table 4.1, none of the proposed changes are relevant to the conclusions of
the original EIA topics relating to traffic and transport, water quality, socio-economics,
and health and waste.
4.2.19 Potential effects on geology, ground conditions and agriculture were considered in

relation to the splitting of the natural gas receiving station and gas treatment compound,
and, in the single GTG scenario, the moving of the switchyard/banking compound.
However, the effects would be unchanged as the Order Limits would not change and
therefore it was concluded that an updated assessment would not be required.

LANDSCAPE
INTRODUCTION
5.1.1
This Chapter considers whether potential landscape and visual impacts arising from the
proposed changes to the Power Generation Plant site would give rise to new or different
environmental effects than those assessed in the ES.
5.1.2
The proposed changes to the Power Generation Plant site have been considered in
relation to the landscape and visual assessment chapter of the ES submitted to support
the application for the Development Consent Order. In terms of visibility, the most
noticeable of the proposed changes compared to the parameters set out in the
Development Consent Order would be changes to the dimensions of both the GTG and
the flue stack (in the single GTG Scenario only). These are the tallest structures and it is
important to note that there would be no change to their overall height.
5.1.3
Changes are proposed to other structures including:
à
in the single GTG scenario - increase in number of black start diesel
generators from one to three; a stand-alone fin fan cooler (new structure); the
location of the banking/switchyard compound; and
à
in all GTG scenarios - increase in dimensions of the black start diesel
generator; the creation of two (out of the current single) natural gas receiving
station and gas treatment compound.
5.1.4
All of the changes referred to in 5.1.3 would affect structures that are of a lower height
than the GTG and flue stack and in terms of visibility would be less noticeable. In the
single GTG scenario the tallest of these structures would be the proposed fin fan cooler,
which would be a new stand-alone structure and would be located adjacent to the gas
turbine building. In the five GTG scenario ancillary cooling systems would be built in and
not visible.
5.1.5
No changes are made to the proposed embedded and secondary landscape mitigation
for the Power Generation Plant.
5.1.6
This updated assessment has focussed on potential changes to views and visual
amenity. Potential landscape effects have not been considered further for the
following reasons:
à
There would be no change to the location or extent of the Power Generation
Plant. It would be built on land currently occupied by large industrial buildings
which would be demolished to accommodate the proposed development.
Potential impacts on landscape character and landscape elements (trees,
woodland/plantations etc.) would be minor, the same as assessed in the ES;
21
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
à
The proposed development would be in keeping with the character and scale
of surrounding industrial and commercial development within Hirwaun
Industrial Estate; and
à
No significant adverse effects were reported on key landscape character
receptors within the locality, including the Brecon Beacons National Park,
Hirwaun Special Landscape Area and sensitive landscape characteristics
identified through LANDMAP. The proposed changes would not result in new,
or materially different, likely significant effects.
5.1.7
      Potential effects would arise in relation to views and visual amenity at a limited
number of locations. The ES identified potential effects on visual amenity would
arise primarily in relation to the five 35m high stacks. Other lower structures
within the Power Generation Plant, including the five GTG, would be
substantially screened by the surrounding industrial buildings and coniferous
plantations at Hirwaun Industrial Estate.
5.1.8
Assuming the proposed changes to the lower structures would be screened by
the existing buildings and vegetation at Hirwaun Industrial Estate, the updated
assessment has focussed on potential changes to views in relation to the tallest
structures, the single flue stack and the GTG, as well as the fin fan cooler, which
would be a new structure. The proposed changes that relate to all GTG
scenarios are not considered to affect landscape or visual impacts given they are
low level structures (5 metres).  The assessment has, therefore, focussed on the
proposed changes to the single GTG scenario, focussing on the flue stack, the
GTG and fin fan cooler for the reasons explained above.  The revised
assessment does not affect the conclusions reported in the ES; no new
significant visual effects are predicted to arise from the proposed changes.
5.2
 METHODOLOGY
5.2.1
The methodology for the assessment of potential visual effects from the
proposed changes has followed the same process and applied the same criteria
as the ES. Similarly, for the purpose of this assessment, impacts that are
assessed as being either moderate adverse or above are considered significant.
5.2.2
This assessment has used selected viewpoints from the original ES that are
representative of receptors with high and medium sensitivity near the Power
Generation Plant site where moderate adverse effects were reported. They
include publicly accessible locations representative of views of a highly valued,
nationally designated landscape, the Brecon Beacons National Park, and public
footpaths and Open Access Land at Hirwaun Common (VP21) and Pendryn
Reservoir (VP14).
5.2.3
The ES reported nearby residential settlements would not have a view of the
project due to screening by intervening landform, woodland or industrial
development. Where views would be available, only a small part of the project
would be visible or the view would be filtered by vegetation. For this reason only
one of the selected viewpoints includes a residential receptor (VP14).
22
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
5.2.4
All viewpoints described in the ES Chapter 11 that relate specifically to the Power
Generation Plant have been reviewed and it has been concluded that there are no new, or
materially different, likely significant effects as a result of the proposed changes at any of
those viewpoints.
5.2.5
This updated assessment has focussed on specific viewpoint locations from the original
ES that are representative of receptors with high and medium sensitivity near the Power
Generation Plant site where moderate adverse effects were reported. They include the
following three viewpoint locations which are representative of views of a highly valued
nationally designated landscape, the Brecon Beacons National Park, public footpaths
and Open Access Land at Hirwaun Common and Pendryn Reservoir:
à
Viewpoint VP14: Pendryn Reservoir;
à
Viewpoint VP15: Hirwaun Common Special Landscape Area; and
à
Viewpoint VP21: Myndd-y-glog Open Access Land, Brecon Beacons National
Park.
5.2.6
The new photomontages for these viewpoints (see Appendix 5) include the same
photographs of existing views that were included in the ES which were taken between
June 2013 and January 2014, a photomontage of the approved project at year one when
landscape mitigation planting would have little visual impact (a single GTG scenario and
the five GTG scenario are shown), and a photomontage showing the proposed changes in
respect of the single GTG scenario, also at year one.  Please refer to ES Figure 11.4,
Viewpoint Locations (Document reference 6.3.0, Volume C), and Photographs and
Photomontages (Document reference 7.1) for the original photomontages for Viewpoints
VP14, VP15 and VP21. The proposed changes are only shown in respect of the single
GTG scenario as it is only in that scenario that the changes referred to in paragraphs 4.1.2
and 4.1.4 have the potential for any new or different environmental effects.
5.2.7
The same methodology has been used for the production of the original and new
photomontages.
5.3
SUMMARY OF ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT
5.3.1
The ES concluded the Power Generation Plant would be located on the site of a former
industrial building within Hirwaun Industrial Estate where it would be substantially
screened by surrounding large-scale buildings and conifer plantations on the boundary of
the industrial estate.  Distant views over the industrial estate are available from higher
ground at Hirwaun Common to the south and the Brecon Beacons National Park to the
north.
5.3.2
The maximum height of the Power Generation Plant stack(s) would be 35m, which would
be taller than adjacent buildings within the industrial estate.  Generally, views would be
limited to the upper part of the stacks which would be seen against the backdrop of higher
ground in the Brecon Beacons National Park and Hirwaun Common.   Views of the Power
Generation Plant would not be available to residential receptors due to screening by
landform, woodland and other industrial buildings at Hirwaun Industrial Estate. With
23

August 2016
mitigation, residual visual impact would be not significant for nearby receptors.
5.3.3
The Power Generation Plant site lies within 2km of the Brecon Beacons National Park
within a buffer zone (the External Zone) where control of light pollution is necessary to
protect the dark sky within the National Park, which is one of its special qualities.
CONSTRUCTION
5.3.4
The ES assessment concluded demolition of redundant buildings on the Power
Generation Plant site would have a positive benefit on views towards and from the
National Park and surrounding rural areas. Construction activities would be
temporary and would have a slight adverse effect on visual receptors.
OPERATION

As described in ES Chapter 4, the realistic worst case in visual terms would be five
gas turbine generators each with a 35m high stack.  Therefore, the ES assessment
was based on this scenario with the stacks set out in a linear arrangement.  They
were considered to be the most prominent elements within the Power Generation
Plant site and would be visible over a wide area. Although they would not cause a
change to the skyline due to the nature of the valley/hill landscape, the top of the
stacks would be visible above nearby mature woodland/coniferous plantations. They
would be seen in the context of other industrial development and would be
noticeably taller than the surrounding buildings.
5.3.6
The proposed Lighting Strategy will control potential light pollution within the Brecon
Beacons National Park External Zone (refer to ES Appendices, Volume D, Appendix
11.2 (Document reference 6.2.0).  The Lighting Strategy is secured via Requirement
16 of the Development Consent Order (Control of Artificial Lighting).

DECOMMISSIONING
5.3.8
The Power Generation Plant will be designed for an operating life of 25 years from
commencement of operation. During decommissioning, temporary activities and potential
visual impacts would be similar to those during construction. Landscape mitigation
planting would be retained and would screen some views of the decommissioning
activities.
5.4
UPDATED ASSESSMENT
5.4.1
The proposed changes to the approved layout of the Power Generation Plant site and
parameters set out in the Development Consent Order are described in detail in Chapter
3 above and are shown in Figures 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. In terms of visibility, the most
noticeable differences are:
à
The alternative layout of the Power Generation Plant (i.e. the moving of the
switchyard/banking compound closer to the GTG) would be based around one
GTG and one flue stack instead of up to five GTGs and flue stacks. The
perimeter fence and mitigation planting would be in the same position as the
approved project;
à
The single GTG would be increased in length to 50 metres (previously 30
metres) and width to 40 metres (previously 30 metres); and
à
The maximum width of the flue stack would be increased to 11 metres up to a
height of 16.5 metres reducing to 10 metres for the remaining height. The
height of the stack would be unchanged (35 metres).
5.4.2
Proposed changes to other lower structures within the Power Generation Plant site would
be less noticeable and would include:
à
In the single GTG scenario, three black start diesel generators would be
required to start up the single GTG.  Whilst this is an increase from one, this
change is only where there is a single GTG.  Accordingly, there would still be
25

Project No 70023845
August 2016
considerably less infrastructure in the single GTG scenario than the five GTG
scenario (the range of one to five GTGs being already consented in the
Development Consent Order).
à
In the single GTG scenario, the fin fan cooler would not specifically form part
of the single GTG and would be replaced by appropriate external ancillary
equipment. The dimensions would be 6 metres high, 13 metres long and 10
metres wide.  Whilst in the single GTG scenario this cooling equipment is
separate from the GTG (unlike in the two to five GTG scenarios where the
cooling equipment are integrated into the GTG), there would still be
considerably less infrastructure in the single GTG scenario than the five GTG
scenario (the range of one to five GTGs being already consented in the
Development Consent Order).
à
For all GTG scenarios, the length of the black start diesel generator would be
increased to 17 metres (previously 13 metres), the maximum height (5
metres) and width (5 metres) remain the same. This change of 4 metres is
deminimus and would not be noticeable in the context of the built
infrastructure.
à
For all GTG scenarios, the single compound consented in the Development
Consent Order for the natural gas receiving station and gas treatment
compound (3 metres high x 50 metres long x 46 metres wide) would be
replaced by two smaller compounds of the following dimensions which would
be an overall reduction in the total built footprint.
§
Compound 1 – Natural Gas Receiving Station: 5 metres high x 36 metres wide
and 50 metres long;
§
Compound 2 – Gas Treatment Compound: 5 metres high x 16 metres wide and
29 metres long.
5.4.3
The approach to landscaping, design and lighting for the Power Generation Plant
would be the same as the approved project.
CONSTRUCTION
5.4.4
Construction and commissioning of the proposed Power Generation Plant would
remain be the same between the project as currently consented and with the
proposed changes.  The same significant short term slight adverse visual effects on
highly sensitive receptors would arise during this stage. Construction activities would
have a direct effect on all areas required for the permanent works, as well as the
construction area, and they would be temporary.
OPERATION
5.4.5
The new photomontages (refer to Appendix 5) illustrate the proposed Power
Generation Plant in the single GTG scenario, which can be compared with the
photomontage for one consented unit. The proposed changes would have little visual
impact at year one when landscape mitigation planting was least effective and would
reduce over time as the planting developed and achieved its full effect by year

fifteen.
5.4.6
The single wider stack (35m high) would be less noticeable in views from the
surrounding landscape than the approved arrangement of up to five stacks (35m
high).The proposed changes to the dimensions and locations of other smaller
structures within the Power Generation Plan would not be discernible in views from
any of the viewpoint locations considered in the ES due to distance.

proposed changes at operation in relation to each of the three viewpoint locations
referred to in paragraph 5.2.5.

DECOMMISSIONING
5.4.8
The assessment of effects at decommissioning would be the same as those reported
in the ES. The Power Generation Plant would be designed for an operating life of 25
years. During decommissioning, site activities would be similar to those during
construction. Retention of the landscape mitigation planting would reduce visual
impacts at this stage compared to the construction stage.
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS
5.4.9
The ES reported cumulative effects in relation to the Power Generation Plant and the
proposed Enviroparks EfW, Hirwaun Energy Centre, Rhigos substation and
overhead transmission line, which would be located within Hirwaun Industrial Estate,
and more distant wind/solar energy projects. A search of the National Infrastructure
Planning register of applications and a search of Rhondda Cynon Taff planning
applications register has been undertaken.  No new applications have been
registered for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects or major planning
applications that would be required to be considered in the assessment of
cumulative effects.
5.4.10 From viewpoint VP14 views of the Power Generation Plant would be seen in
conjunction with the Enviroparks EfW, the Hirwaun Energy Centre and the Rhigos
substation overhead transmission line. The ES assessed the overall cumulative
impact would be minor and the significance of effect would be slight adverse. The
same developments would be visible from viewpoint VP15 and the cumulative
effects were also assessed to be slight adverse.
5.4.11 From viewpoint VP21 the Enviroparks EfW, Hirwaun Energy Centre and overhead
transmission line at Rhigos substation would be visible in conjunction with the Power
Generation Plant. From further afield views of renewable energy projects would
include the proposed INRG solar PV at Hendre Fawr, the Mynydd Wind farm to the
south and Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm at Hirwaun Common. The ES assessed the
overall cumulative impact would be minor and the significance of effect would be
slight adverse.
MITIGATION AND RESIDUAL EFFECTS
5.4.12 The proposed changes to the Power Generation Plant would incorporate the same
embedded mitigation in the design of all its elements and the same secondary
landscape mitigation as described in the original ES, all of which are secured in the
Development Consent Order through the Requirements
5.4.13 In respect of landscape and visual effects, embedded mitigation would include:
à
Utilising technology (SCGT) that will allow a significant reduction in stack
height compared to other technology types and there will be no visible plume
(Table 2 in Requirement 4 secures parameters (as proposed to be amended
in this application));
32
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
à
The architectural design of the buildings will assimilate the Power Generation
Plant into the surrounding landscape (Requirement 4 secures detailed design
and design principles);
à
External lighting will be designed to reduce trespass and configured to avoid
glare and spillage (Requirement 16 secures the Lighting Strategy); and
à
The retention of existing trees where practical (Requirements 5 (Provision of
Landscaping), Requirement 10 (Ecological Management Plan) and
Requirement 12 (Construction Environmental Management Plan) are
applicable in this regard.
5.4.14 The same measures as those set out in ES Figure 11.5 Landscape Mitigation
Proposals (Document Reference 6.3.0 Figures, Volume C,) would be undertaken to
address specific residual adverse effects of the proposed changes to the Power
Generation Plant that cannot be designed out. They include:
à
Retention of existing trees wherever possible;
à
A belt of trees on the eastern side of the Power Generation Plant site to link in
with the existing wood on the northern boundary to screen views from the
A465 road across the Hirwaun Industrial Estate;
à
A belt of trees along the western side of the Power Generation Plant site;
à
A tree planting along the southern boundary of the site adjacent to Main
Avenue; and
à
The retention and reinstatement of semi-improved grassland on the northern
boundary of the site.
5.4.15 Planting on the boundary of the Power Generation Plant site would be subject to
National Grid planting constraints in relation to gas pipelines.
5.4.16 Residual landscape impacts would be no worse than those originally reported. The
site was previously used as industrial land; therefore the impact on the landscape
resource would be negligible. Residual impacts on landscape character would not be
significant because the Power Generation Plant would be located within an area
where it would be surrounded by similar industrial development. Subject to
appropriate control of lighting during construction and operation in accordance with
the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority’s External Lighting Recommendations,
potential impacts on the quality of the dark sky within the National Park would be the
same as the approved project (and Requirement 16 requires the Brecon Beacons
National Park Authority to be consulted over the Lighting Strategy prior to its
approval).
5.4.17 Residual visual impacts arising from the proposed changes to the Power Generation
Plant on high sensitivity receptors would also be no worse than originally reported.
Visual effects would be localised and substantially screened by large scale industrial
development adjacent to the Power Generation Plant site, landscape mitigation
planting, and the surrounding offsite vegetation comprising conifer plantations, scrub

woodland and hedgerows.
5.5
CONCLUSIONS
5.5.1
It is concluded that the potential significance of landscape effects associated with the
proposed changes are no greater than those previously assessed for the approved
project. No significant landscape effects are predicted to arise at operation.
5.5.2
There would be no material change to the character of the view from the three
selected viewpoints, or any of the other ES viewpoint locations that relate specifically
to the Power Generation Plant. The assessed magnitude and significance of impact
would be lower than the realistic worst case reported in the ES. No significant visual
effects are predicted to arise at operation.
5.5.3
Potential cumulative landscape or visual effects in relation to the Power Generation
Plant site would be the same as the original ES and there are no additional
applications identified which require consideration in the assessment (see paragraph
5.4.9 above).
6
AIR QUALITY
6.1
INTRODUCTION
6.1.1
The air quality assessment for the original EIA considered the impacts of the Project
during construction, operation and decommissioning due to:
à
Dust and particulate matter emissions generating during construction and
decommissioning activities; and
à
Stack emissions (nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide) from the operation of
the Power Generation Plant.
6.1.2
Impacts on human and ecological receptors as a result of direct exposure to pollutants in
ambient air and as a result of the deposition of pollutants to the surface of the ground and
vegetation were considered.
6.1.3
The assessment of impacts during construction and decommissioning was undertaken
using a qualitative risk based approach; operational impacts were assessed
quantitatively using detailed dispersion modelling.
6.2
SCREENING OF CONSTRUCTION/DECOMMISSIONING IMPACTS
6.2.1
The original assessment concluded that during construction (and decommissioning)
temporary, slight adverse effects were possible with embedded mitigation measures.  As
a result, additional mitigation, in the form of visual and automatic monitoring of dust
emissions and the erection of solid hoarding on the northern edge of the site during
demolition, was proposed.  It was concluded that, with this additional mitigation, any
34
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
residual impacts would be of negligible significance.
6.2.2
The proposed changes to the dimensions of the various aspects of the Project will have
no material impact on the assessment of construction and decommissioning impacts.
6.2.3
The original assessment was based on the approach set out in Institute of Air Quality
Management (IAQM) Guidance on the assessment of construction impacts (2011).  The
assessment has four stages:
à
Identification of receptors in distance bands from the works and their
sensitivity to air quality impacts;
à
Assessment of particulate matter emissions potential;
à
Assessment of the risk of impacts in the absence of mitigation; and
à
Assessment of the significance of the effects following mitigation.
6.2.4
Decommissioning impacts were assumed in the original assessment to be equivalent to
the construction impacts.
6.2.5
The proposed dimension changes for the Project will not affect the potential receptors
since, to ensure a conservative (likely worst case) assessment, these were assessed in
relation to the Order Limits as a whole, rather than in relation to distinct works areas.
Furthermore, the Project dimension changes will not affect the assessment of the dust
emissions potential of the works i.e. the emissions potential from earthworks remains
large (since the total site area was, and remains, greater than the IAQM criteria of
10,000m2) and the emissions potential from construction remains small (since the total
volume remains less than the IAQM criteria of 25,000m3, the majority of which will be
prefabricated).  In addition, the dimension changes will not result in any increase in the
maximum number of construction vehicles accessing the site in any given day (linked to
the assessed risk of track-out of dust from the site on the wheels and undercarriage of
vehicles).
6.2.6
With no change to receptors or emissions potential, the risks of dust impacts are
unchanged from the original assessment and, as such, there is no requirement for
additional mitigation.
6.2.7
To conclude, the Project, including revised dimensions, will have a negligible likely
impact on air quality during construction and decommissioning.
6.3
OPERATIONAL IMPACTS
6.3.1
The potential operational impacts of the Project relate to the impacts of exhaust
emissions from the GTG unit(s).
6.3.2
The ground level impact of an emission to air is determined by various factors including
atmospheric conditions and the effective height of the release. For all meteorological
conditions, the higher the effective release height, the lower the ground level impacts.
6.3.3
The effective height of the release is, in turn, determined by the physical height of the
35
Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015
WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff
Hirwaun Power Limited
Project No 70023845
August 2016
release (the stack height), the height of nearby buildings and the buoyancy of the plume
in providing initial plume rise before the exhaust gases become well mixed with the
surrounding air.
6.3.4
It is well established that the buoyancy of a plume increases with increasing temperature
of the exhaust gases and also with increasing volume flow. Therefore, to ensure a
conservative (likely worst case) assessment of impacts, the original air quality
assessment was based on a scenario employing five 59MW GTGs and it was assumed
that the plumes from these generators do not merge.  The revised Project dimensions do
not affect the scenario employing five generators, but potentially affect the dispersion of
pollutant from the single GTG scenario.
6.3.5
Whilst the single GTG scenario is, in general, expected to result in lower impacts than the
five GTG scenario, due to the greater plume buoyancy described above, the increased
dimensions of the single GTG may affect the downwash of pollutants in the wake of the
unit.  Increased downwash may increase ground level concentrations of pollutants,
although these effects would be limited to the immediate vicinity of the GTG1.
6.3.6
Additional dispersion modelling has been undertaken to conclusively demonstrate that a
single GTG scenario (within the revised Project dimensions set out in Table 3-1) will
result in air quality impacts that are equivalent to (or lower than) the five GTG scenario
considered within the original assessment.
6.3.7
It should be noted that the increase in the external width of the flue stack (from 10m to
11m noted in the revised specified) applies to the lower section of the flue only.  This has
no impact on the dispersion of pollutants.  Rather, the dispersion of pollutants is affected
by the internal size of the flue at the point of exit to atmosphere (top of the flue).  This is
unaffected by the revisions.
6.3.8
The basic methodology for the additional dispersion modelling follows that used for the
original assessment, with the generator emissions data updated to a single generator
option (Table 6-1).

atmosphere. Turbulent wake zones can be created around buildings that force pollutants to the
ground instead of allowing them to rise freely within the atmosphere. Building downwash occurs as
the wind flows over and around buildings and impacts the dispersion of pollution from nearby
stacks.

Building downwash was taken into account in the original assessment with the inclusion
of five GTGs with a footprint 39m x 16m and height of 10m (above ground level).  Each
stack was located at the centre of a turbine unit and each turbine unit was oriented
approximately north-south.
6.3.10 The single GTG has a maximum height of 19m and a revised footprint of maximum
length 50m and width 40m.  It is a limitation of the ADMS dispersion model that all
buildings must be represented as cuboid in shape.  As such, the representation of the
generator in the dispersion model is, of necessity, a simplification of its actual
dimensions.
6.3.11 In specifying the building dimensions for the modelling, it is essential that the simplified
representation appropriately captures the likely generation of the turbulent building wake.
As a result, for the Project, the GTG was represented as building of dimension 19m (H) x
60m (L) x 30m (W), oriented approximately north-south with the stack located on the
northern end.  It is emphasised that these dimensions are to be used for the assessment
of dispersion of pollutants only and assume that the lower section of the stack
effectively acts as part of the building – given the size of the stack footprint, this is
appropriate.
6.3.12 Black start generators are scoped out of this assessment as they are only used very
rarely for short periods e.g. to start the generators when the National Gas Transmission
System fails.  Testing will also be limited.  The increase of one to three black start
generators will also result in no increased adverse effects.

SUMMARY OF ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT
6.4.1
The original assessment concluded that there are no significant adverse residual effects
associated with the operation of the Project.
6.4.2
With the stack height set in the range 30m to 35m, and NOX emissions at the limit set by
the IED (50mg/Nm3), the predicted effects of the Project on ambient air quality were
negligible in significance.  In particular, for ambient pollutant concentrations, total
predicted environmental concentrations with the operation of the plant were well within
the air quality objectives set in UK regulations for the protection of health and
ecosystems.
6.4.3
For nitrogen and acid deposition, whilst existing levels were shown to exceed the critical
load, the realistic worst case impacts of the Project were less than 1% of the critical load
with a 35m stack and less than 1.1% of the critical with a 30m stack for nitrogen
deposition and less than 0.6% of the critical loads for acid deposition.
6.4.4
The predicted impacts, both in isolation and cumulatively with other relevant development
proposals were immeasurably small and hence considered imperceptible.
6.4.5
Overall, therefore, the assessment concluded that the Project will have a negligible likely
impact on air quality in relation to both human and ecological receptors. This applies for
the Project alone and in combination with other proposed facilities in the vicinity of the
Project site.
6.5
UPDATED ASSESSMENT
IMPACTS ON HUMAN RECEPTORS
6.5.1
Table 6-3 shows the impact of the Project on maximum ground level concentrations of
nitrogen dioxide with the original assessment (5 unit) and revised (1 unit) generator
specifications.  Nitrogen dioxide is the key pollutant for human health.
6.5.2
The revision to the specifications has no effect on the conclusions of the assessment.
That is to say, there is a negligible risk of exceedance of the objectives/EU limit values
and, as such, no significant health effects are anticipated with the operation of the
Project.  Indeed, maximum hourly impacts decrease significantly with the one unit option
in comparison to the five unit option presented in the original assessment.
6.5.3
With the single GTG specification, the maximum annual mean process contribution
(taking into account likely operating hours in the year) is unchanged from the original
assessment (0.4µg/m3 or 1% of the air quality objective of 40µg/m3).  The maximum
hourly concentrations decrease from 18.6µg/m3 to 7.2µg/m3 (9.3% to 3.6% of the
objective of 200µg/m3).
6.5.4
Similarly, impacts on carbon monoxide concentrations remain imperceptible with the one

Minimum value = the lowest maximum annual average concentration modelled over the 5 years (2008

Predicted Environment Concentration = Process Contribution plus Background Concentrations.
IMPACTS ON ECOLOGICAL RECEPTORS
6.5.5
Table 6-4 and Table 6-5 show the impact of the Project on annual mean and daily mean
nitrogen oxides respectively over the various designated ecological sites for the original
(five GTG) and revised (single GTG) generator specifications.
6.5.6
The impacts of the specification revision are beneficial, with marked reductions in annual
mean and daily mean impacts over all of the sites designated for nature conservation,
including Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and its supporting features in
the Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC).  In
addition, total pollutant concentrations remain well below the air quality
objectives/standards for the protection of ecosystems, whether the single GTG or five
GTG scenario is in operation.
6.5.7
Since nitrogen deposition is directly proportional to the modelled concentration of
nitrogen oxides, the impact of the specification revision on nitrogen deposition will also be
beneficial.
6.5.8
For example, over Blaen Cynon SAC, nitrogen deposition due to the Project was
modelled to be 0.06kgN/ha/yr (1.2% of the critical load of 5kgN/ha/yr) with the five unit
option.  With the 1 unit option, this reduces to 0.01kgN/ha/yr (0.2% of the critical).

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS
6.5.9
The original assessment explicitly modelled the cumulative impact of the Project with
other facilities in the vicinity of the Project site.  The conclusion of the assessment was
that the impacts of the operation of the generator(s) are imperceptibly small and will not
give appreciable effects on either human health or sensitive ecological habitats,
irrespective of the cumulative impacts with background concentrations and other
developments.
6.5.10 A search of the National Infrastructure Planning register of applications and a search of
Rhondda Cynon Taff planning applications register has been undertaken.  No new
applications have been registered for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects or
major planning applications that would be required to be considered in the assessment of
cumulative effects.
6.5.11 Since the maximum contribution of the single GTG scenario to ground level
concentrations is the same as, or less than, the contribution of the five GTG scenario
presented in the original assessment, the conclusions relating to the cumulative impact of
the Project with other facilities presented in the original assessment remain unchanged.
MITIGATION AND RESIDUAL EFFECTS
6.5.12 No significant impacts are predicted to arise as a result of the operation of the Project
and, as such, the Project does not warrant mitigation beyond that implicitly included in
the design, namely a stack height between 30 and 35m inclusive, and emissions control
to maintain emissions within the limits set by the IED.  This applies with the revised
specifications.

CONCLUSIONS
6.6.1
The proposed changes have no material impact on the conclusions of the original ES.
6.6.2
Overall, the Project, with proposed changes, will continue to have a negligible likely
impact on air quality in relation to both human and ecological receptors during
construction, operation and decommissioning. This applies both for the Project alone and
in combination with other proposed facilities in the vicinity of the Project site
7
CONCLUSIONS
7.1.1
The outcome of the screening and updated assessments confirms that the conclusions in
the ES remain valid for the proposed changes.  The significance of the impact would be
unchanged or reduced. It is therefore considered that the proposed changes are non-
material amendments for the purposes of the Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and
Revocation of, Development Consent Orders) Regulations 2011.
