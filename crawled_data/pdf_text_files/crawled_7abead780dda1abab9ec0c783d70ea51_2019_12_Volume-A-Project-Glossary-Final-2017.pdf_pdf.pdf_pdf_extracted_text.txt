dB(A) 
A-weighting sound level 
The sound pressure level 
determined when using the 
frequency-weighting network 
A.  The A-weighting network 
modifies the electrical

meter so that the sensitivity 
of the meter varies with 
frequency in approximately 
the same way that the 
sensitivity of the human 
hearing system varies with 
frequency.   
The human ear has a non-
linear frequency response; it 
is less sensitive at low and 
high frequencies and most 
sensitive in the range of 1 to 
4 kHz.  The A-weighting is 
applied to measured or 
calculated sound pressure 
levels so that these levels 
correspond more closely to
