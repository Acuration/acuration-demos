THE 7 PRINCIPLES OF A SUSTAINABLE FOREST 
BIOMASS POLICY – PROVEN TO WORK 
Working forests, such as those 
that supply biomass, also work 
for the environment. 
By encouraging good forest 
management practices, working 
forests can help maintain and 
grow carbon stocks, protect soil 
and water quality and safeguard 
biodiversity. However, in order to 
properly secure these beneﬁts, it 
is vital that: 
• The biomass used is sustainably 
produced; avoiding depletion of 
forest carbon stocks. 
As Europe’s largest 
decarbonisation project, these 
standards have proven to work 
effectively for Drax. The right 
framework in which to 
demonstrate the sustainability 
of our biomass sources in 
Europe and across the world 
has enabled us to realise 
signiﬁcant carbon savings of 
86% relative to the coal we 
would have burnt, while at the 
same time encouraging the 
growth of carbon stocks in the 
areas we source from. 
 
Biomass is a well-established 
and essential part of the 
renewable energy mix in the 
UK, the EU and worldwide. 
Biomass is unique as it offers a 
combination of energy security, 
flexibility and reliability at 
competitive cost, whilst also 
helping achieve decarbonisation 
targets and signiﬁcant 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
savings when replacing coal or 
other fossil fuels.  
• GHG supply chain emissions 
are minimised, measured 
and reported to verify the 
savings achieved. 
For these reasons, the use of 
biomass in the UK is regulated 
under the EU Timber Regulations 
(ensuring legality) and the 
Renewables Obligation (RO), 
which deﬁnes some of the 
strictest requirements in the 
world for biomass sustainability, 
including the protection of 
sensitive habitats, the 
maintenance of forest growing 
stock, and limits to supply chain 
GHG emissions. 
Drax strongly believes there is 
a need for equally robust EU 
sustainability standards and 
a clear investment outlook, 
based on the principles 
outlined as follows. 
Biomass is unique as 
it offers a 
combination of 
energy security, 
flexibility and 
reliability at

PRINCIPLE ONE: FOREST BIOMASS FOR BIOENERGY 
SHOULD BE SOURCED FROM SUSTAINABLE FORESTS 
Working forests, such as those 
that supply biomass, can benefit 
the environment by boosting 
carbon stock, protecting water 
and soil quality as well as 
promoting biodiversity. 
However, in line with the 
principles of sustainable forest 
management, generators should 
not receive subsidy when the 
biomass used could cause long-
term carbon stock decreases in 
ecosystems; biodiversity loss; 
soil erosion; or depletion of 
water sources. The impacts 
of feedstock harvesting on 
soil should be identiﬁed and 
mitigation measures 
implemented in the ﬁeld as 
necessary to minimise the 
risk of loss of soil vitality due 
to forest management 
activities. Robust 
sustainability compliance 
schemes allow generators to 
demonstrate they are 
avoiding biomass sourced 
from higher-risk areas. 
 
HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
Drax can readily demonstrate that we source from sustainably managed and productive, working forests 
– both long-established plantations and naturally regenerating forests. Evidence shows that the growing 
stock of the forest areas from which we source is being maintained or increasing – providing assurance 
that carbon stocks are not depleted and that Drax does not cause deforestation or forest decline. 
Drax takes practical steps based on the UK RO to identify ‘no go areas’ and specify forest types that we 
do not allow ﬁbre to be sourced from. This means we do not take from protected forests, old growth or 
primary forest, sites that have been classiﬁed as having a high bio-diversity value, or from plantations that 
have been converted from natural forest since 1 January 2008.

PRINCIPLE TWO: BIOENERGY FROM FOREST BIOMASS SHOULD NOT 
BE PRODUCED FROM HIGH-RISK FEEDSTOCKS 
 
HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
Around 40% of all the feedstock 
supplied to Drax originates as 
a sawmill residue. The balance of 
Drax’s requirement is made of 
other material that arises naturally 
as a by-product of management for 
high-grade material. Sources 
include low-value roundwood such 
as thinnings, and other low-grade 
wood arising at the time of felling. 
The use of roundwood derived 
from thinning – a process to 
improve the production of the 
ﬁnal sawlog crop – and low- grade 
roundwood produced as a by-
product from sawlog harvesting, 
are long-standing forestry 
practices and very beneﬁcial to 
the long-term health and 
productivity of the forest. 
Seeking to deﬁne and limit the 
use of roundwood would result in 
less material recovery, poorer 
forest management and increased 
risk of land conversion to other 
uses. 
It is not in the forest owner’s interest 
to degrade the long-term productive 
potential of their land by 
recovering excessive amounts of 
harvest residue. This commercial 
reality, along with the adherence 
to SFM principles, protects 
against excessive forest residue 
recovery. 
Drax notes that certain types of 
feedstock are not typically used 
for bioenergy,  demonstrating 
feedstock restrictions are not 
necessary, for example: 
• High-quality, large diameter 
sawlogs, which would 
otherwise be used to make 
furniture, structural timber or 
other high-value uses where 
carbon would have been locked 
up in a ﬁnal product for many 
years. These are generally far 
too expensive for use by the 
bioenergy industry 
• Stumps, where removal raises 
the risk of detrimental impact 
on the forest soil and overall 
carbon stock. These are not 
suitable for pelletisation 
Some counterfactual scenarios 
are more likely than others to 
create a temporary rise in 
atmospheric carbon. Whilst the 
global warming potential of 
temporary rises in atmospheric 
carbon is strongly influenced by  
those counterfactuals and is 
widely debated, there is
consensus that the natural 
carbon cycle will, in time, replace 
biogenic carbon. It is important to 
note that counterfactuals which 
may lead to longer payback 
periods do not typically occur 
where the pellet industry sources 
feedstocks and policy should 
recognise this. 
While policy choices such as 
diameter caps or restrictions to 
waste and residues have been 
advocated as a way of reducing 
the risk of using unsustainable 
forest biomass, a robust risk 
based assessment like that used 
in the UK has proven to be 
successful at mitigating risk in a 
way that is both implementable 
and beneﬁcial for the 
environment.   
By contrast, a feedstock 
restriction to waste and residues 
would discourage long-standing 
forestry practices such as 
thinning, which improve the long 
term health and productivity of 
the forest, and its capacity to 
store carbon in living trees and in 
the products it provides. 
Some counterfactual 
scenarios are more likely 
than others to create a 
temporary rise in 
atmospheric carbon.

PRINCIPLE THREE: CARBON SAVINGS AND EMISSIONS 
SHOULD BE PROPERLY ACCOUNTED 
 
4 
HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
This is a complex area and 
different mechanisms are 
required to account for the 
different aspects listed above. 
Fossil fuel substitution is easily 
measured, as are emissions 
associated with harvest, 
processing and transport. 
Various national sustainability 
schemes, including the UK’s 
RO, already account for these. 
The UK regime has strict limits, 
which are monitored using the  
UK Government’s B2C2 
calculator. Thresholds decrease 
over time to drive continuous 
improvement. 
Maintenance and  growth 
of forest carbon stock can 
be monitored using existing 
mechanisms such as LULUCF 
(particularly as redeﬁned by 
the proposed amendments to 
Regulation No. 525/2013) or 
public forest inventory  
analysis. The risk of carbon debt 
can be assessed through the 
historic impact that demand for 
wood has had on forests. In 
almost all cases, the evidence 
strongly suggests demand for 
wood stimulates supply and 
leads to better carbon outcomes 
in the near term, when measured 
across at a landscape scale, and 
that is the scale that scientists 
recognise as relevant for this 
discussion. 
Biomass that receives 
subsidy should be subject to 
comprehensive accounting of 
carbon emissions and savings, 
including fossil fuel substitution 
and changes in forest carbon 
stock. It should also include 
emissions associated with 
harvest, processing and transport 
of the biomass.
Maintenance and 
growth of forest 
carbon stock can be 
monitored using 
existing mechanisms.

PRINCIPLE FOUR: BIOENERGY USE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 
WHAT CAN BE SUSTAINABLY SUPPLIED 
There is a natural limit to the 
amount of biomass that is 
available on the planet, and the 
resource cannot be considered 
to be inﬁnite. That is why it 
is so critical that all wood is 
from demonstrably sustainable 
sources. However, bioenergy 
for large-scale users represents 
a tiny fraction of the annual 
harvest in the EU, US or globally, 
and it is important the sector is 
considered in this context. 
EU policymakers 
should insist that 
biomass is sourced 
from veriﬁed 
sustainably managed 
forests. 
 
HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
As suggested in principle one, EU policymakers should insist that biomass is legally and 
sustainably sourced. This would ensure that biomass is supplied at a rate that forests can 
sustainably deliver. This provision alone provides appropriate protection from over-exploitation, 
but also recognises and accommodates the hugely varied international forest market dynamics.

PRINCIPLE FIVE: SUPPORT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ALL TECHNOLOGIES 
THAT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT CARBON SAVINGS 
6 
HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
Drax delivers over 86% carbon reductions relative to the coal we would have burnt, and 68% relative to the 
average emissions from a UK gas power station. This means we are currently able to deliver around 16% 
of the UK’s renewable power and help deliver the UK’s global commitments to decarbonisation. There is 
no shortage of suitable, sustainably grown fuel in the parts of the world we source from, so it would be 
perverse for the EU to consider obliging the UK to return to burning more fossil fuels than it needs to. 
Current grid infrastructure requires flexible, reliable power, to balance and control network performance. 
Biomass conversion is already providing these essential services, previously delivered by fossil-based 
thermal generators. 
Significant carbon savings can be 
delivered through the conversion 
of existing coal power stations to 
biomass. The thermal efficiency 
of such stations may not be as 
high as a newly built plant, but 
they do allow governments to 
move away from coal quickly, cost-
effectively and at scale while 
maintaining power-grid stability.

infrastructure 
requires flexible, 
reliable power, to 
balance and control 
network performance,

PRINCIPLE SIX: THE EFFICIENT USE OF RAW MATERIALS IS 
SUPPORTED BY ENCOURAGING BUOYANT FOREST BIOMASS MARKETS 
 
 
 
 
 
HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
For Drax, pelletisation allows the safe, cost-efﬁcient and low-carbon transport of fuel from those parts of the 
world with the highest quantities of un-mobilised wood or unused by-products available. This is beneﬁcial as 
it does not place pressure on other parts of the world where there are not such large surpluses. 
Furthermore, the economics of forestry mean that a natural cascading principle operates whereby the 
highest value wood is typically used by the sawlog market, which has the highest wood-paying capability. As 
a general rule, other markets for the next lower grades can pay more for ﬁbre than pellet mills and so there 
is a strong economic incentive (demonstrated by the actual locations of various mills) for pellet mills to avoid 
catchment areas where there is strong competition for low-value ﬁbre. In this way, normal economics ensure 
that effective cascading takes place, with higher-value wood going to high-value industries. 
Substantial quantities of forest 
residues and co-products of 
forestry currently go unused in 
many parts of the world, in 
particular the South-Eastern 
US, Canada and some Baltic 
states. It is logical that biomass 
is sourced from regions where 
the largest surpluses exist and 
the forest carbon balance can 
be maintained. Unreasonable 
restrictions to trade should
therefore be avoided.  
Biomass currently plays a 
uniquely important role in 
reducing carbon emissions 
from the power and heat 
sectors across Europe. In 
some countries, there are no 
practical alternatives at 
scale. However, there may 
be a time when alternatives 
to biomass power 
generation can be deployed 
at scale or there is a greater 
need to use biomass in 
other ways, for example to 
replace fossil-hydrocarbons 
in the chemical industries or 
natural gas in heating 
applications. It is important 
that national governments 
have the flexibility to 
respond to these challenges 
in due course – including 
retention of the ability to 
place appropriate time limits 
on renewable subsidies.  
The need for flexibility has 
been recognised by the 
European Commission, 
which undertook an in-
depth study into the 
optimised cascading use of 
wood. This study concludes 
that guidance, rather than 
legislation, is the best route 
to achieve the most 
efﬁcient use of wood given 
the complex market drivers 
that underpin the many 
markets for wood products.

PRINCIPLE SEVEN: THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FOREST 
BIOMASS SHOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED 
Independent veriﬁcation helps 
guarantee that biomass is 
sustainably sourced, both within 
the EU and in third countries. 
Within Europe, biomass should 
come from forests that are 
managed in accordance with the 
principles of sustainable forest 
management (SFM), as defined 
by Forest Europe. Outside Europe, 
the forest management principles 
should at least correspond with 
these principles. One way to 
achieve this is by using forest 
level management certification 
schemes such as Forest 
Stewardship Council® (FSC®)* and 
Programme for the Endorsement 
of Forest Certification (PEFC). 
However, the challenge 
for EU policymakers is to 
ensure such principles are 
applied in geographies with 
a low uptake of forest level 
certiﬁcation schemes, such 
that the principles of Forest 
Europe can be applied equally 
within the EU and elsewhere 
without exceeding the Union’s 
competence, which does not 
include forestry. 
Area-based risk assessment 
schemes such as the Sustainable 
Biomass Program (SBP), which 
uses a supply-base evaluation 
for a pellet producer, when the 
supply base is not FSC or PEFC 
certiﬁed, address this challenge 
by providing the necessary 
assurance in these locations. 
Therefore, the EU should place a 
requirement on users in receipt 
of subsidy to use either a forest 
certiﬁcation or an area-based 
scheme to demonstrate the 
sustainability of the forest 
management in the area from 
which they source biomass. 
To demonstrate sufﬁcient 
rigour, all voluntary schemes, 
whether forest certiﬁcation or 
area-based risk assessment, 
should: 
• Correspond to well- 
established principles 
of Sustainable Forest 
Management; 
• Have accredited certiﬁcation 
bodies 
• Include stakeholders in the 
development of criteria; 
• Be transparent; and 
• Audits should be performed 
by an independent 
certiﬁcation body. 
The UK RO provides a blueprint 
for how such schemes can 
regulate the larger-scale use of 
biomass, without attempting 
to rewrite the rules in third 
countries or breaching World 
Trade Organisation rules. 
* Drax FSC License code: FSC – C119787 
  HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE 
Drax’s own sustainability verification scheme has been in place for several years, using third party auditors 
to independently verify that the RO criteria are being met on the ground, whether the biomass is sourced 
within the EU or from third countries. 
More recently, the SBP standard (which meets the characteristics described above) has been benchmarked 
by the UK government as consistent with the requirements for a voluntary scheme that demonstrates 
compliance with the RO. This standard also includes principles that are speciﬁc to bioenergy, such as 
forest carbon maintenance. 
Independent sustainability checks are done on all Drax suppliers before contracts are entered into. 
Thereafter, sustainability audits containing over 107 detailed checks are carried out on a regular basis. 
These audits ensure sustainability across the entire supply chain.
