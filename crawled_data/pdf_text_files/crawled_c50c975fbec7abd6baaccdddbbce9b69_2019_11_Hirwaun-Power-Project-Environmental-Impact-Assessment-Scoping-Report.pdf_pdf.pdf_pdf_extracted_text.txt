INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document presents the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
Scoping Report for the Hirwaun Power Project (HPP).  This Report has 
been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd on behalf of Hirwaun Power 
Limited (HPL).  
1.1.2 
HPL is promoting a new thermal generating station on land at the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate, in Aberdare, Mid-Glamorgan, South Wales 
(approximate grid reference SN 938 061) (referred to as the ‘Power 
Generation Plant’). The site location is shown in Figure 1.   
1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide an electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts Electrical (MWe) and would be fuelled 
by natural gas.  
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 
(PA 2008) and therefore an application for a development consent 
order (DCO) is to be made to the Secretary of State (SoS).  
1.2 
The Proposed Development 
1.2.1 
The three main elements of the HPP would comprise:  
� 
The Power Generation Plant, a gas fired power generating station 
capable of providing up to 299 MWe; 
� 
A new electrical connection (referred to as the ‘Electrical 
Connection’) to export power from the Power Generation Plant to 
the National Grid; and  
� 
A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the ‘Gas 
Connection’) to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant 
from the National Transmission System (NTS).  
1.2.2 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection together are referred to as the ‘Hirwaun Power Project or 
HPP’ and are all required for the generation of electricity and the 
subsequent export of that electricity to the National Grid. The DCO 
application may include the whole of the HPP.

1.2.3 
The three key elements which make up the HPP are described below:  
Power Generation Plant 
1.2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would comprise of the following principal 
elements required for the generation of electricity:  
� 
Gas / steam turbines; 
� 
Stack(s);  
� 
Cooling equipment;  
� 
Workshops and stores; 
� 
Water tanks;  
� 
Administration and control buildings; 
� 
Gas receiving station; 
� 
Auxiliary boiler; and 
� 
Miscellaneous buildings and associated equipment. 
1.2.5 
All of the above elements would be located within the proposed Power 
Generation Plant site boundary shown outlined in red on Figure 1 and 
are integral aspects of the NSIP.  A potential layout of these main plant 
items is shown in Figure 2.  Further details on their size and function 
are given in Section 3.3 of this Report. 
Gas Connection  
1.2.6 
The Gas Connection would comprise a new gas pipeline which would 
connect the Power Generation Plant site with Feeder 2 (Garway to 
Rhigos Pipeline) on the NTS, which runs to the south and east of the 
Power Generation Plant site.   
1.2.7 
Currently, there are four connection route options available to HPL, 
which are being further considered for their suitability.  The connection 
options will be further refined and the options narrowed to a single 
connection route prior to submission of the DCO application.  
1.2.8 
The potential route corridor options currently under consideration for 
the Gas Connection are shown on Figure 3 and Inserts 5 - 8.  Further 
details of the potential connection route options are provided in Section 
3.4 of this Report.

Electrical Connection  
1.2.9 
There are currently a number of options available for the Electrical 
Connection to export power from the Power Generation Plant to the 
National Grid. These options comprise a new 400 kV electricity export 
cable, either in the form of an underground cable or overhead line. In 
either case, the cable/line would run west from the boundary of the 
Power Generation Site, to the new ‘Rhigos Substation’.  This substation 
is expected to be completed by 2016, when the nearby 256 MW Pen Y 
Cymoedd Wind Farm is also due to be connected. 
1.2.10 
A new switchyard would also be required. This infrastructure would be 
situated within the Power Generation Plant site, as shown on Figure 3.  
1.2.11 
The potential route corridor options currently under consideration for 
the Electrical Connection are also shown on Figure 3 and Inserts 9 and 
10.  As with the Gas Connection, the options for the Electrical 
Connection will be refined and narrowed to a single connection route 
prior to submission of the DCO application.  Further details are given in 
Section 3.5 of this Report.

1.3 
Need for and Benefits of the Project  
1.3.1 
This section briefly summarises why the HPP is needed and how it 
would contribute towards ensuring greater reliability of electricity supply 
in the UK.  
1.3.2 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
sets out national policy for energy infrastructure and is part of a suite of 
National Policy Statements (NPS) designated to guide the examination 
and determination of DCO applications.  
1.3.3 
NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, and 
confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there is a 
significant need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace 
capacity that will be lost through the closure of existing large plant. 
Indeed it states that the decision-maker ‘should start with a 
presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2).   
1.3.4 
NPS EN-1 therefore establishes the general need case for energy 
NSIPs, including gas generation.  This has been preceded and followed 
by other government policy and evidence, some of which is 
summarised below to provide further context.  
1.3.5 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is government policy that 
the electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of 
technologies that continuously and reliably produce stable and 
controllable power and that within this scenario, gas-fuelled electricity 
generating technologies can play a significant role.  Thus in the second 
Annual Energy Statement (AES) (November, 2011), the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change (DECC) directed the need to build new 
power generation infrastructure.  In line with this requirement, DECC 
acknowledged the need for gas to continue to feature strongly in the 
energy mix, and also stated that while it is important that businesses 
play their part in the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is also 
important to remain competitive. 
1.3.6 
These statements are supported by the more recent Gas Generation 
Strategy, released by DECC in December 2012
1.  The Strategy sets 
out the important role that gas generation—as a reliable, flexible source 
of electricity—will play in any future generation mix, supporting a 
secure, low-carbon and affordable electricity system.  It states that 
“Gas currently forms an integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is 
a reliable, flexible source of electricity.  Using gas as a fuel in our power

stations currently provides a significant proportion of our electricity 
generation (around 40% in 2011)”.  
1.3.7 
Moreover, it suggests that there could be as much as 37GW of new 
gas generation infrastructure required if the decarbonisation target is 
set at 200g/CO2/kWh. It also indicates that in 2030 we could need more 
overall gas capacity than we have today, although operating at lower 
load factors. The modelling shows that gas could play a more extensive 
role, with higher load factors, should the 4th Carbon Budget be revised 
upwards” (Executive Summary).  
1.3.8 
The paper also presents scenarios which indicate that up to 41 GW of 
new gas generation capacity will be needed by 2030 to underpin long 
term electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind 
generation at times of peak demand. 
1.3.9 
In October 2012, Ofgem (the electricity and gas regulatory body) 
prepared a report entitled ‘Electricity Capacity Assessment’ which was 
submitted to the SoS and estimates a set of plausible electricity 
capacity margins that could be delivered by the market over the next 
four years and the associated risks to security of supply. 
1.3.10 
One of the key findings of the Ofgem report is that electricity de-rated 
capacity margins will decrease significantly from the current historically 
high levels.  In parallel, the risk of electricity customer disconnections 
will appreciably increase from near zero levels.  This is primarily 
because of a significant reduction in electricity supplies from coal and 
oil plants, which are due to close under European environmental 
legislation. 
1.3.11 
Furthermore, the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) publication, 
‘Energy Wales – a Low Carbon Transition’ states that  
1.3.12 
“Gas will be a key transitional fuel because greenhouse gas emissions 
from gas are significantly less than coal subject to the method of 
extraction.  Gas is a flexible, responsive and reliable source of energy 
which can play a key role in the transition to a genuinely low carbon 
energy system.  
1.3.13 
In the short term, gas, nuclear and bio-energy will provide the energy to 
compensate for the intermittency in supply from renewable resources” 
(page 10). 
1.3.14 
With the large number of wind turbines that are now providing electricity 
to the National Grid and the increasing number of solar farms being 
proposed, both of which represent an intermittent power supply, there 
is also significant consideration being given to the need for flexible

power on the network.  Parsons Brinckerhoff’s “Powering the Future” 
report2 which maps the route to a low carbon economy, has predicted 
that up to 9,000 MW of flexible power would be needed by 2050 to help 
stabilise the National Grid due the intermittent supply, in particular from 
offshore wind.  
1.3.15 
Given the above, there is therefore a clear and significant requirement 
for further capacity to meet the projected need for both base load (i.e. 
continuously operational) and reactive/flexible generation.  A dedicated 
gas fired plant at the Power Generation Plant site  could allow for the 
rapid provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid, or provide a 
constant supply of reliable electricity generation, thus playing a role in 
meeting the energy requirements of the UK going forward.  
1.4 
The Developer 
1.4.1 
The Developer of the proposed HPP is HPL.  HPL is the Special 
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which has been set up to develop the HPP and 
supporting infrastructure.  
1.4.2 
HPL has been established by Watt Power Limited. (WPL).  WPL has 
been established to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to 
support the UK Government drive to a low carbon economy.  Stag 
Energy provides the resources through a management services 
agreement with WPL.  Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the 
company draws on a depth of experience with a team that has created 
and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation and related 
infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW was 
delivered in the UK.   
1.4.3 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to the Gateway Storage 
Company Ltd, which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage 
facility in the East Irish Sea.  The project has been consented by the 
UK Government and the local planning authority (Barrow-in-Furness, 
Cumbria) 
(for 
further 
information

www.gatewaystorage.co.uk).  
1.4.4 
WPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government drive to a low carbon economy.  HPL recognises the need 
to balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and 
concerns of energy projects and believes this can be responsibly 
delivered at a local level.

In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is 
considered to be a NSIP if its generating capacity is more than 
50 MWe.  As the proposed Power Generation Plant at Hirwaun will 
have a generating capacity of up to 299MWe, it will be classified as a 
NSIP under Part 3, Section 14(1)(a) and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008. 
Under Part 4, Section 31 of the PA 2008, development consent is 
required for development that is or forms part of a NSIP.  It is HPL’s 
intention to submit the DCO application to the SoS in due course. 
1.5.2 
Section 37 of the PA 2008 governs the content of an application for a 
DCO, including the requirements for the necessary accompanying 
documents.   
1.5.3 
The consenting process under the PA 2008 has been designed to 
ensure that the public, local authorities and interest groups are 
provided the opportunity to get involved and for their views to be given 
due regard, whilst also reducing the overall time required to obtain 
permission for nationally significant infrastructure by establishing the 
national needs case for such infrastructure through the publication of 
NPSs. 
1.5.4 
Further information on the application process for NSIPs and other 
information about PINS can be found at their website:

Requirement for an EIA and Notification under Regulation 6(1)(b) 
1.5.5 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 
2009 
(the 
EIA 
Regulations) 
impose 
procedural 
requirements, in particular, the carrying out of EIA in relation to 
applications for DCOs.  All development in Schedule 1 (Schedule 1

development) requires EIA.  Development in Schedule 2 (Schedule 2 
development) requires EIA if it is likely to have significant effects on the 
environment.  
1.5.6 
The definition of Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating 
stations with a heat output of 300MW or more (Schedule 1(2)(a)). 
1.5.7 
Although, as described above, the Power Generation Plant will have an 
electrical output of up to 299MWe, the thermal output of the plant will 
be of the order of 400-950MW (depending on the final technology 
choice) and therefore an EIA will be required under the EIA regulations.  
1.5.8 
Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’ 
which is produced as part of the process of the combustion of fuel.  
Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, 
which is why this is a larger value than electrical output.  
1.5.9 
This Report therefore constitutes formal notification to the SoS under 
Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations that HPL proposes to provide 
an Environmental Statement (ES) in respect of the DCO application.  
HPL understands that PINS will notify consultation bodies as required 
in accordance with Regulation 9(1)(a) of the EIA Regulations. 
1.5.10 
Section 5(2)(a) of The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed 
Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (as amended), require that 
where applicable, the ES required pursuant to the EIA Regulations, 
together with any scoping or screening opinions or directions, must 
accompany the DCO application. 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 
1.5.11 
The Gas Connection is integral to the Power Generation Plant NSIP 
and can be included in the DCO application. The Electrical Connection 
may also be included. However, it may be desirable for programme 
reasons to obtain separate consents for the connections. It is HPL’s 
intention to confirm its consenting approach in light of the identification 
of the preferred corridor routes 
1.5.12 
HPL confirms that all components of the HPP included in the DCO 
application will be assessed in the accompanying ES (including 
cumulative impacts). If the Electrical and/or Gas Connection is 
separately consented, and so is not included in the DCO application, 
HPL proposes to include information on the indicative works required 
for the connection in the ES, insofar as it's available. The aim of this is 
to allow the SoS to understand if there are likely to be constraints and 
to allow for an assessment of cumulative effects.

1.5.13 
For the purposes of EIA Scoping in respect of the DCO application, 
HPL seeks views on the scope of assessments for all elements of the 
HPP and also on the proposed approach to the Electrical and Gas 
Connections if they are separately consented. 
Consultation Strategy 
1.5.14 
A well designed consultation strategy will allow all potentially affected 
parties to comment on and input to the planning and development 
process.  HPL will ensure that all representations made during the 
consultation process are considered carefully, and where appropriate, 
taken account of, prior to submission of the DCO. 
1.5.15 
The PA 2008 and the associated secondary legislation set out the 
provisions for consultation with relevant parties prior to the submission 
of a DCO application to the SoS.  As part of this, a Statement of 
Community Consultation (SoCC) will be discussed with the relevant 
local authorities before being published.  The SoCC will set out how 
HPL intends to consult with the local community in accordance with 
Section 47 of the PA 2008.  The document will also set out how HPL 
intends to provide opportunities for the community to access the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) which will be 
prepared in due course. 
1.5.16 
In addition, and in accordance with Section 42 of the PA 2008, HPL will 
also consult with the relevant local authorities, other statutory 
consultees, and persons with an interest in any land that is affected by 
the DCO application.  The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (as amended) list 
the statutory consultees.  
1.5.17 
Consultees, including members of the community, will be able to submit 
representations throughout the pre application stage and HPL will take 
account of representations made as the project progresses.  The 
outputs generated from the formal statutory consultation undertaken in 
accordance with Sections 42 and 47 of the PA 2008 will be 
summarised in a consultation report, submitted with the DCO 
application.  
1.5.18 
HPL recognises that the SoS has a duty under Regulation 8(6) of the 
EIA Regulations to consult widely before adopting a Scoping Opinion.  
A full list of the bodies consulted by the SoS under Regulation 9(1)(a) 
will accompany the Scoping Opinion provided to HPL in accordance 
with Regulation 9(1)(b).  It is also noted by HPL that whilst the SoS’s 
list may inform HPL’s future consultation, it should not be relied upon 
for that purpose.  HPL is familiar with PINS Advice Note 3 ‘Consultation 
and notification undertaken by the Planning Inspectorate’ (May 2012).

1.5.19 
Before formal statutory consultation can start, it is a requirement of 
Section 46 of the PA 2008, for HPL to notify the SoS of its intention to 
commence formal consultation, and in doing so provide adequate 
information on which it intends to commence that consultation. 
1.5.20 
HPL has already commenced some early informal (i.e. non statutory) 
consultation, and, where relevant, the outcome of these consultations 
has informed this Report.   
1.5.21 
To date, discussions and pre planning advice and have been received 
from Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCT), Welsh 
Assembly Government (WAG), Environment Agency Wales (EAW) and 
the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW). 
1.5.22 
It is also acknowledged here that as of 1st April 2013, the EAW, 
Forestry Commission and CCW merged into one organisation called 
Natural Resources Wales (NRW).  NRW will be a statutory consultee 
for the HPP.  
1.5.23 
Comments on this Report are invited, relating to the possible significant 
environmental effects of the HPP and the proposed assessment 
methodologies presented in this document.  Comments are also invited 
on any other issues that should be addressed and any sources of

REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This section of the Report outlines the main regulatory and policy 
framework that is relevant to the proposed HPP.   
2.1.2 
Relevant EU directives are considered first, at a high level.  
2.1.3 
This section also gives an overview of the current and emerging 
policies relevant to the HPP at the national, regional and local levels as 
they relate to the consideration of the likely scope of EIA.  
2.1.4 
Further description of the planning policy background and its relevance 
to the HPP will be provided in the Planning Statement, which will be 
produced as a separate document to support the DCO application.  A 
summary of the impacts of the proposed HPP on relevant and 
important planning policy will be discussed more fully within the ES and 
other documents submitted for examination in support of the draft DCO.  
2.2 
European Union (EU) 
2.2.1 
Current EU directives of particular relevance to the HPP with respect to 
environmental requirements are as follows: 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain 
public and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive) 
2.2.2 
The EIA Directive ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely 
to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an 
environmental assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation.  The 
Directive sets the thresholds for projects that require an EIA (as stated 
in Section 1.5) and also outlines the impacts on the environment to be 
assessed in the EIA process.  
Directive 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 (the Public Participation 
Directive). 
2.2.3 
The Public Participation Directive implements the obligations arising 
from the Århus Convention and amends the EIA Directive and the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (see 2.2.4 
below) to improve public participation. 
Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions 
(integrated pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial 
Emissions Directive (IED)) 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Environmental 
Impact Assessment Scoping Report

2.2.4 
In December 2007 the EU adopted a Proposal for a Directive on 
industrial emissions (IED).  The IED recasts seven existing directives 
related to industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 
January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control 
(the IPPC Directive) and Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on 
the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large 
combustion plants (the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into 
a single legislative instrument to improve the permitting, compliance 
and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States.  However, the 
general principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD Directive 
described below are retained and will remain relevant to the HPP.  
2.2.5 
The purpose of the IPPC Directive was to achieve integrated 
prevention and control of pollution arising from certain potentially 
polluting processes and to ensure a high level of protection for the 
environment taken as a whole.  Measures were laid down to prevent or, 
where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and 
land with the introduction of emission limit values (ELV) and best 
available techniques (BAT).  With regard to power projects, combustion 
installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW are subject to 
the IPPC Directive.  The IPPC Directive is transposed into UK 
legislation via the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) and the IED is to be transposed 
through amendments to the Environmental Permitting (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2010.  An Environmental Permit will be required for 
the operation of the Power Generation Plant. 
2.2.6 
The purpose of the LCPD was to limit the emissions of certain 
pollutants into the atmosphere from large combustion processes.  The 
LCPD applied to combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to 
or greater than 50 MW.  The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulphur dioxide(SO2) and particulates were subject to the stringent 
ELVs stipulated in the LCPD.  The LCPD requirements for new plant 
are implemented in the UK regulations by the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010. 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of 
natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) 
2.2.7 
The aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-
diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora.  Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member 
States are designed to maintain or restore, at conservation status, 
natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of community 
interest whilst also taking into account economic, social and cultural 
requirements and regional and local characteristics.  The Conservation

of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the Habitats 
Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of 
wild birds (the Birds Directive) 
2.2.8 
The Birds Directive provides a comprehensive scheme for the 
protection of wild bird species naturally occurring within the EU.  The 
Directive places great emphasis on the protection of habitats suitable 
for supporting endangered and migratory species, introducing a system 
of Special Protection Area designation to protect important habitats.  
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the requirements of 
the Birds Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and 
cleaner air for Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive) 
2.2.9 
Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and 
management (the Air Quality Framework Directive) described the basic 
principles of how air quality should be assessed and managed in the 
Member States.  
Subsequent 'Daughter Directives' introduced 
numerical limits, thresholds and monitoring requirements for a variety of 
pollutants including oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide to guarantee 
that there are no adverse effects with regard to human health.  The Air 
Quality Standards Regulations 2010 give effect, in England and Wales, 
to the Ambient Air Quality Directive. 
2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 & 
Policy Context  
2.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant is categorised as a NSIP and will be 
determined by the SoS under the regime established by the PA 2008.   
2.3.2 
As set out in NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for 
Energy), ‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-
specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for decisions’ 
(paragraph 1.1.1) and the decision-maker ‘should start with a 
presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2).   
2.3.3 
Decisions must also be taken by the SoS having regard to the local 
impact report and any other matters which the SoS ‘thinks are both 
important and relevant to its decision’ (paragraph 1.1.1), which may 
include the Development Plan Documents or other documents in the 
Local Development Framework.

2.3.4 
The DCO application will be examined by PINS with the decision made 
by the SoS.   
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
The PA 2008 required new policy to inform decisions on NSIPs in 
England and Wales.  Policy for such infrastructure is set out in NPS.  
Those that are relevant to the consideration of the HPP are: 
� 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1); 
� 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2);  
� 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines; and  
�  
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure 
2.4.2 
NPS EN-1 Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy contains 
government policy on energy and energy infrastructure development, 
representing the needs case for any proposal for an energy NSIP.  
2.4.3 
NPS EN-1 recognises that there is a significant need for new energy 
infrastructure.  It states that pending plant closures in the UK will 
reduce available capacity by 22 GW by 2020 as a result of tightening 
environmental legislation and older power stations approaching the end 
of their useful life (paragraphs 3.3.7 to 3.3.9).  
2.4.4 
NPS EN-1 also sets out guidance on the consideration of alternatives 
when developing a new energy generation project (paragraphs 4.4.2-
4.4.3) and guidance relating to criteria for ‘good design’ of new 
developments (Section 4.5)  
2.4.5 
Specific guidance on good design is also provided in  NPS EN-2, 
including that “applicants should demonstrate good design particularly 
in respect of landscape and visual amenity (…) and in the design of the 
project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, transport 
impacts and air emissions.” 
2.4.6 
In Section 4.6 of EN-1, the consideration of Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) is denoted as an assessment principle in itself and references to 
other guidance and viability considerations are set out.  It is stated that 
applicants should consider CHP from the earliest point and it should be 
a criterion for site selection (paragraph 4.6.7).

2.4.7 
Section 4.8 of NPS EN-1 also sets out how applicants and the SoS 
should take the effects of climate change into account when developing 
and consenting NSIPs.  Paragraph 4.8.11 requires any adaptation 
measures to be based on the latest set of UK Climate Projections, the 
Government’s latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (when 
available) and in consultation with the EA. 
2.4.8 
Other assessment principles that are particularly likely to be relevant to 
energy NSIPs  are set out as follows in EN-1 (relevant paragraph 
numbers given in brackets): 
� 
Pollution control (4.10) describes the relationship with other regimes 
(e.g. Environmental Permitting) which is essentially that the decision 
maker should be satisfied that ‘potential releases can be adequately 
regulated 
under 
the 
pollution 
control 
framework’ 
without 
unacceptable cumulative impacts arising; 
� 
Safety (4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): describes the 
relationship with other regimes and the general requirement that the 
decision maker will need to be satisfied that they are complied with.  
� 
Health (4.13): requires that an assessment of potential health 
impacts is made in relation to each element of the project, such as 
in relation to air quality, waste or noise and describing the 
relationship with other regimes, stating at 4.13.5 that where 
separate air quality regulations are (or will be) satisfied then the 
decision maker is likely to consider these effective mitigation, 
whereas for noise or other aspects it will take account of health 
concerns when setting requirements. 
� 
Nuisance and amenity (4.14): the relationship with common law 
nuisance, statutory nuisance, and the importance to be attached by 
the SoS to their consideration during the determination process, are 
set out.  
� 
Security (4.15): government policy is set out as being ‘to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are 
designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the 
project 
development’ 
with 
documentary 
requirements 
and 
relationships to other guidance set out. 
2.4.9 
As well as generic assessment principles, EN-1 also identifies a 
generic list of impacts which could arise from an energy NSIP. These 
specific topics include ecology, landscape, noise and socio-economics. 
These topics have been discussed in more detail when describing the 
assessment of impacts in Section 5 of this Scoping Report.

2.4.10 
NPS EN-2 outlines considerations and factors relating to site selection 
and design for developers for fossil fuel generating stations, although it 
states that these concerns must be considered by the applicant, and 
that: “…the Government does not seek to direct applicants to particular 
sites for fossil fuel generating stations.” 
2.4.11 
NPS EN-4 sets government policy on the relevant considerations and 
factors that should be taken into account as to route selection for 
developers for gas supply infrastructure and gas pipelines, along with 
likely impacts of their construction, commissioning and operation.  
2.4.12 
NPS EN-5 provides the primary basis for decisions taken by PINS on 
applications it receives for electricity networks infrastructure, the 
relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into account 
related to route selection for developers, along with likely impacts of 
their construction, commissioning and operation. 
2.5 
Welsh Planning Policy 
Planning Policy Wales (Edition 5, November 2012) (PPW) and 
Associated Technical Advice Notes (TAN) 
2.5.1 
‘Planning Policy Wales’ (PPW) sets out the land use planning policies 
of the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) and is supplemented by 21 
topic based Technical Advice Notes (TANs).  TANs prescribe the 
government’s policies on various planning issues that shape the 
preparation of development plans.  The principles and objectives of 
TANs prescribe the overarching national guidance for specific individual 
environmental topics.  Both the PPW and TANs are material 
considerations in determining planning applications under the TCPA 
regime.  It may be determined that these policy documents are relevant 
and important under the PA 2008 regime.  
2.5.2 
Potentially relevant chapters of PPW are: 
� Chapter 4 - Planning for Sustainability;  
� Chapter 5 - Conserving and Improving Natural Heritage and the 
Coast; 
� Chapter 7 - Economic Development; 
� Chapter 12 - Infrastructure and Services; and  
� Chapter 13 - Minimising and Managing Environmental Risks and 
Pollution.

Local Planning Policy 
Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan up to 2021(2011) 
2.6.1 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan up to 2021 was 
adopted by the Council in March 2011 and sets out  “.....the framework 
for decisions to be made up until 2021 on how land is used in the 
County Borough, for example what type of development is appropriate 
or desirable and how best to protect our environment”. 
2.6.2 
The Local Development Plan provides part of the Development Plan 
against which applications under the TCPA regime are to be 
determined, and parts may be relevant and important under the PA 
2008 regime.  
2.6.3 
Section 4 of the plan sets out the Core Strategy for Rhondda Cynon Taf 
and outlines the spatial strategy for guiding all future development and 
land use in the Borough.  Section 5 sets out detailed area wide policies, 
and Section 6 outlines specific policies for the northern and southern 
areas of the Borough.  
2.6.4 
The area of Hirwaun Industrial Estate proposed for the development of 
the Power Generation Plant is designated in the Proposals Map as 
Policy CS 9 Waste Management.  The Hirwaun Industrial Estate is 
identified as a regional site that is able to accommodate a range of 
waste management options to meet the capacity requirements set out 
in the South East Wales Regional Waste Plan.  The Local Development 
Plan notes that “in identifying Hirwaun Industrial Estate as a suitable 
site for waste management, it is not the intention that the employment 
uses at the site should cease.” 
2.6.5 
Other policies of the Local Development Plan of potential relevance to 
the proposed HPP are:  
� CS1 – Development in the North  
� CS9 – Waste Management  
� AW2 – Sustainable Locations

Other Relevant Policy and Guidance 
2.7.1 
The following are considered to be potentially relevant policy and 
guidance in considering the potential impact of the HPP:  
� The Electricity Market Reform (2012);  
� A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ Energy Policy Statement (2010);  
� Environment Strategy for Wales (2006); 
� Gas Generation Strategy (2012); and 
� Turning Heads – A Strategy for the Heads of the Valleys (June 
2006).  
� Energy Wales – A Low Carbon Transition 
2.7.2 
A comprehensive review of potentially relevant policy and evidence will 
be undertaken during the pre application process. 
The Electricity Market Reform (2012) 
2.7.3 
The Electricity Market Reform (EMR) has been developed to meet 
three main objectives: 
� Ensuring the future security of electricity supplies; 
� Driving the decarbonisation of electricity generation; and 
� Minimising costs to consumers. 
2.7.4 
These measures are designed to provide both technical and economic 
encouragement for an increase in the development of low carbon 
technologies.

2.7.5 
In terms of the proposed HPP, one of the most relevant aims of the 
EMR is to provide “.... a mechanism to support security of supply, if 
needed, in the form of a Capacity Market”.  
2.7.6 
Although the EMR focuses heavily on the need for decarbonisation, 
there is also a strong focus on the need for security of supply and a mix 
of energy generation technologies on line at any one time.  The EMR 
also recognises that gas fired power generation will continue to play a 
crucial role in the UK energy mix going forward.  
2.7.7 
The Energy Bill will be the primary piece of legislation to come about as 
a result of the EMR, although it is currently at Committee Stage in the 
House of Commons.  The Energy Bill seeks to enact the key drivers 
that are necessary to achieve the recommendations set out in the 
EMR.  
A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ Energy Policy Statement (2010) 
2.7.8 
In terms of energy production, the WAG reflects the UK policy position, 
the work of the UK Climate Change Commission and the UK National 
Policy Statements on Energy and Renewables through its Policy 
Statement: ‘A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ Energy Policy 
Statement, March 2010.’ The statement sets out a framework for 
carbon reduction in Wales, provides targets and advice to LPAs for 
implementation of policy into LDPs. 
2.7.9 
The Energy Policy Statement aims to maximise energy savings and 
energy efficiency to make producing the majority of the energy Wales 
needs from low carbon sources that are more feasible and less costly.  
Secondly the statement recognises energy needs in a modern society 
will remain considerable, and must be met securely from low carbon 
sources. 
2.7.10 
It draws on the work of: the Wales Climate Change Strategy; the 
National Energy Efficiency and Savings Plan; the Green Jobs Strategy; 
and the Ministerial Advisory Group on Economy and Transport’s report 
on “The Energy Sector”. 
2.7.11 
The statement also reflects the UK policy position, the work of the UK 
Climate Change Commission and the UK National Policy Statements 
on Energy and Renewables. 
The Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) 
2.7.12 
The Environment Strategy for Wales outlines the WAG’s long term 
strategy for the environment of Wales, setting out the strategic direction 
for the next 20 years.  The purpose of the Strategy is to provide a

Turning Heads – A Strategy for the Heads of the Valleys 2020 outlines 
a strategy for regenerating the northern valley areas of South East 
Wales.  In Rhondda Cynon Taf the strategy area includes Treorchy, 
Treherbert, Ferndale, Hirwaun, Mountain Ash and Aberdare. The 
objectives of the programme reflect those of the Wales Spatial Plan in 
seeking to ensure: 
� An attractive and well used natural, historic and built environment;

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
3.1 
Overview of the Development 
3.1.1 
The proposed Power Generation Plant would be situated within 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate, approximately 1.3 km north east of Rhigos, 
2km west of Hirwaun, and 5 km west of Aberdare, south Wales.  (Grid 
Reference SN 938 061).  The Power Generation Plant would be 
located on an area of land which is currently occupied by a large 
industrial building used for storage and distribution. 
3.1.2 
A small area to the south of the main Power Generation Plant boundary 
(to the south of Main Avenue) could be used as a laydown area for the 
storage of plant and equipment during construction.  
3.1.3 
The Gas Connection would run from the Power Generation Plant to the 
east into Feeder 2 on the gas NTS, with an approximate length ranging 
from 1.1 to 1.7 km dependant upon which connection route option is 
chosen.  
3.1.4 
The Electrical Connection would connect the Power Generation Plant 
to a new substation, constructed approximately 350m west of the 
Power Generation Plant site (Rhigos Substation).  The substation is 
currently under construction by National Grid Company (NGC) in 
connection with the development of the Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm, 
which has recently been granted planning consent.  The electrical 
connection would be a 400kV overhead line or underground cable.  
3.1.5 
Figure 2 shows a potential plant layout and likely maximum extent of 
the Power Generation Plant, and Figure 3 shows potential Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection route corridor options.  
3.2 
Site and Surroundings 
3.2.1 
The site for the Power Generation Plant is situated entirely within the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate and covers an area of approximately 7.5 ha.  
The site is entirely within the jurisdiction of Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council (RCT), although it is also close to the area 
administered by the Brecon Beacons National Park (BBNP) Authority.   
RCT covers an area of the South Wales Valleys stretching from the 
Brecon Beacons in the north, to the outskirts of Cardiff in the south. It 
comprises a mixture of urban, semi-suburban and rural communities, 
situated in mountains and lowland farmland. 
3.2.2 
The Power Generation Plant site and immediate surrounding area are 
characterised by industrial buildings (some in use, others vacant); 
scrub grassland and plantation woodland.  The boundary of the Power

Generation Plant, as shown on Figure 2, is currently occupied by a 
large distribution warehouse building.  The majority of other buildings in 
the Hirwaun Industrial Estate are disused and some have fallen into a 
state of disrepair.  
3.2.3 
The Power Generation Plant site is accessed via Main Avenue and 
Fourth Avenue, which both run through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  
These roads connect to Fifth Avenue, again, with the Industrial Estate 
which in turn connects to Rhigos Road (to the south of the site).  The 
Industrial Estate is well served in terms of highway connections.  
3.2.4 
The road network in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant can be 
seen in Figure 1.   
3.2.5 
The A465 ‘Heads of the Valleys’ Road runs approximately 0.1km north 
of the site, Tower Colliery is approximately 1 km south of the site, the 
BBNP is approximately 0.3 km to the north of the site and Penderyn 
Reservoir is approximately 1 km north of the site. The closest 
residential receptors include;   
� 
Rhigos (1.3km south west); 
� 
Hirwaun (1.4km east); 
� 
Penderyn (1.8km north); and  
� 
Aberdare (5km east).  
3.2.6 
These receptors are shown below in Insert 1 below.

3.2.7 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate was established in WWII as a Royal 
Ordnance Factory (ROF), one of 4 across South Wales. 
3.2.8 
The estate passed into public sector ownership, eventually coming 
under the control of the Welsh Development Agency who invested in 
the location and undertook the speculative development of smaller 
factory units around the estate.  In the 1960s, GEC Marconi established 
a TV factory at Hirwaun; in c.1974 a joint venture was entered into by 
GEC with Hitachi and in 1984 Hitachi took over the factory entirely. 
Hitachi expanded the plant with the ‘Advance Factory’ constructed in 
1988 however by 2001 the decision had been taken to close the plant.  
3.2.9 
In 2002 International Greetings Plc acquired the freehold interest in the 
entire facility and has operated a storage and distribution facility for its 
paper gift wrap product since that date. 
3.2.10 
Enviroparks were granted planning permission in 2010 to build an 
Energy from Waste (EfW) plant on a site approximately 500m north of 
the proposed Power Generation Plant to power local industrial sites.  
The initial site clearance is planned to commence in August 2013 and

the plant will process around 150,000 tonnes of waste per year by 
2014/15. By 2016, it is envisaged that the plant will process around 
240,000 tonnes of waste per year. 
3.2.11 
The Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm has recently been granted consent 
under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and deemed planning 
permission.  It is approximately 5km south west of proposed Power 
Generation Plant at its closest point and comprises 76 turbines across 
an area of 4,680 hectares. The land ranges in altitude between 360m 
and 600m AOD, with each turbine being up to 145m in height.  Site 
preparation, in the form of tree felling has already begun at the site.  
3.2.12 
The land south of Hirwaun has been designated as a Strategic Site in 
the RCT Local Development Plan.  This land has been allocated for the 
construction of 400 dwellings, 89 acres of employment, a new primary 
school, a 2000m2 retail store, medical / community centre and informal 
recreation.  Development of the Strategic Site will be subject to a large-
scale reclamation scheme due to the fact that it overlaps with the site of 
Tower Colliery, presently subject of open cast operation likely to last for 
approximately six years hence. 
3.3 
Description of the Power Generation Plant Options 
3.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide a total output 
of up to 299 MWe (gross capacity) at rated site conditions.  
3.3.2 
The choice of plant and technology have not been finalised yet and are 
still the focus of ongoing technical studies.  Plant choice will also be 
driven by the outcome of the EMR (previously described in Section 2 of 
this Report).  Further studies will ensure that the most suitable plant is 
selected for the site, taking into consideration local constraints and the 
ultimate operational regime of the plant.  However, it is known at this 
stage that the project would either comprise a Combined Cycle Gas 
Turbine (CCGT) plant, a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant or a 
reciprocating gas ignition engine (RGE) plant.  Additionally, under 
certain circumstances it may be that two of these technologies are used 
at the site at any one time.  The ability to utilise CHP to supply local 
users with waste heat from the plant is also being investigated, as 
outlined later in this Section of the Report.  A description of how each of 
these technologies operate and the key differences between them are 
provided below.  
3.3.3 
Although the choice of plant may vary, the scope and methodology of 
the EIA, as set out in Sections 4 and 5 of this Report will not differ 
significantly between different plant and technology choices.  There will 
be some key differences between the plant configuration for each 
technology type (e.g. water usage and stack height) and, where these

will impact on the assessment methodology, this has been drawn out 
below.  
3.3.4 
Additionally, it is noted that no matter which technology choice is 
selected, they are all able to fit within the Power Generation Plant site 
boundary shown in Figures 1 and 2.  All of the potential technology 
choices would also fall within identified ‘maximum adverse’ scenarios 
for potential environmental impacts which will be assessed as part of 
the EIA.  A range of indicative dimensions of main plant items are 
provided in Table 3.1 below, which may be reduced depending upon 
the outcome of further studies and consultation, and depending upon 
final design and plant choices. 
CCGT Plant 
3.3.5 
If a CCGT plant is chosen for the Power Generation Plant, the 
configuration of the plant would comprise of a gas turbine(s) (GT) 
fuelled by natural gas, a heat recovery steam generator(s) (HRSG) 
utilising heat from the GT exhaust gases, and a steam turbine plant 
with associated condensing system.  
3.3.6 
Natural gas is burnt in the combustors of each GT, utilising the air that 
is compressed by the compressor section of the GT.  The hot gases 
expand through the turbine section of the GT to drive the compressor 
section and to generate electricity.  The hot exhaust gases are then 
routed through the HRSG to generate steam, which in turn is used to 
generate electricity via the steam turbine plant. 
3.3.7 
After the useful heat has been extracted from the exhaust gases in the 
HRSG, the flue gas enters the stack where it rises to be released to 
atmosphere at height for dispersion.  A bypass stack may be employed 
between the GT and the HRSG to allow for simple cycle (GT only) 
operation where required. 
3.3.8 
Spent steam leaving the steam turbine plant passes to a condenser 
where it is condensed.  The resultant condensate is returned to the 
HRSG for reuse as boiler feed water, closing the water/steam cycle.   
3.3.9 
The gas turbines would be equipped with standard proven emissions 
control technology, which would limit the production of Nitrous oxides 
(NOx) to ensure that the plant meets all relevant guidelines and 
legislation.  
3.3.10 
Natural gas in the UK (where sulphur content in the gas is generally 
negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the particulate 
or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; consequently flue 
gas cleaning equipment is not required.

3.3.11 
To achieve the condensing of the spent steam, dry air cooling utilising 
an Air Cooled Condenser (ACC) is proposed.  This cooling system 
results in significantly lower water usage by the plant than if cooling 
towers were employed.  
3.3.12 
In utilising an ACC, the spent steam leaving the steam turbine passes 
through ductwork to the top of the ACC, where it is distributed to a 
multiplicity of tubes for condensation.  Ambient air is forced past the 
tubes by motor-driven fans and the heat of the condensation process is 
transferred to the air.  The use of an ACC means that there is no need 
for cooling towers or a once-through cooling water system, thereby 
minimising the plant’s net water consumption and water abstraction 
requirements.   
3.3.13 
An ACC is typically taller and narrower than an equivalent duty forced 
draught cooling tower, but it bears no risk of visible plume formation 
from the cooling system.  
3.3.14

SCGT Plant  
3.3.15 
In essence, the configuration of a simple cycle gas turbine (SCGT) 
plant consists of the front end of a CCGT plant.  SCGT plants usually 
use aero-derivative GTs, primarily because of their suitability to 
frequent starts, high SCGT efficiency and high-availability maintenance 
options.   
3.3.16 
As with CCGT plants, natural gas is burnt in the combustors of each 
GT, utilising the air that is compressed by the compressor section of 
the GT.  The hot gases expand through the turbine section of the GT to 
drive the compressor section and to generate electricity.  However, the 
hot exhaust gases are then routed directly to the stack, which contains 
a silencer to reduce noise pollution. 
3.3.17 
The stack for an SCGT plant is usually significantly shorter than the 
main stack of a CCGT plant because the flue gases are much hotter 
and therefore do not typically require the same height needed for 
adequate dispersion.  
3.3.18 
The gas turbines would be equipped with standard proven emissions 
control technology, which limits the production of NOx to a maximum of 
50 mg/Nm3 (corrected to 15% O2 dry).  Whether by water injection or 
dry low emission combustors, these techniques represents BAT for 
limiting emissions of NOx to atmosphere from gas turbines without the 
addition of chemical solutions, such as selective catalytic reduction 
using ammonia. 
3.3.19 
Once again, natural gas in the UK (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; 
consequently flue gas cleaning equipment is not required. 
3.3.20 
Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of SCGT plants are significantly lower than for CCGT 
plants.  The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, etc.) 
would be met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan coolers.   
3.3.21 
Insert 3 shows a simple schematic of SCGT operation.

Insert 3 Schematic of SCGT Operation 
 
 
 
Reciprocating Gas Engine Plant 
3.3.22 
The configuration of a large RGE plant is similar to that of an SCGT 
plant.  It consists of modular reciprocating gas engine generator units, 
typically below 20 MW each, which operate using the ignition of 
gaseous fuels and air in a specific mix which causes motion of a piston 
to generate electricity.  New plants generally have a high net plant 
electrical efficiency of over 45%, which is greater than any SCGT plant, 
although lower than a CCGT plant (typical efficiency of 55-60%).  Full 
plant output is maintained over a range of ambient temperatures and 
barometric pressures (altitudes). 
3.3.23 
Natural gas is burnt in the cylinders of the multi-cylinder RGEs, utilising 
the air that is first pressurised by the turbo charger(s) of each RGE and 
then compressed by the pistons.  Four-stroke, medium-speed, lean-
burn gas engines that utilise either spark ignition or pilot injection to 
initiate combustion are employed.  In the case of pilot injection, a small 
quantity of compression ignition fuel (such as diesel) is required.  As a 
result of the piston being utilised to compress the combustion air and 
gas fuel mixture, there is a low gas fuel supply pressure requirement.   
3.3.24 
The size of the stacks for an RGE plant is similar to that for a SCGT 
plant even though the exhaust gas flow rate of the RGE plant is lower 
than the equivalent SCGT plant.  This is because the flues from several

engines are combined into a single stack-like structure.  The flue gas 
temperature is slightly lower but of a similar order to aeroderivative GTs 
and thus stack heights are generally similar to SCGT plants. 
3.3.25 
Gas engines produce a higher amount of NOx than GTs, up to 
500 mg/Nm3 (corrected to 5% O2 dry).  Therefore, for the HPP there 
may be a requirement to install Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) to 
treat the engine exhaust gas to reduce the NOx emissions to required 
levels.  
3.3.26 
Once again, natural gas in the UK (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; 
consequently flue gas cleaning equipment (beyond that of SCR, 
potentially) is not required. 
3.3.27 
Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of RGE plants are significantly lower than for CCGT 
plants.  The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, jacket 
cooling, etc.) is met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan 
coolers.   
3.3.28 
Unlike SCGT plants, there is no potential for boosting power output 
using water injection, so the total plant water requirement is negligible. 
Laydown Area 
3.3.29 
A small area to the south of the main Power Generation Plant boundary 
(to the south of main Avenue) could be used as a laydown area for the 
storage of plant and equipment during construction.  
Dimensions

Table 3.1 provides indicative dimensions for the main plant items which 
would be present at the Power Generation Plant site.

Construction, Operational and Decommissioning Timescales 
3.3.33 
Construction and commissioning of the HPP will take approximately 12 
to 36 months, depending on the final choice of plant technology 
selected. 
3.3.34 
The main works associated with the construction phase would be the 
demolition of existing buildings, removal of old foundations / 
hardstanding, excavation and site levelling for new foundations, 
potential piling (if required) and the laying of the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection.  
3.3.35 
The construction of RGE / SCGT plant would most likely involve the 
least site preparation and construction time, as the units are often 
available as complete packaged units which can be delivered to the site 
and installed relatively quickly.  The construction period for a CCGT 
plant could be significantly longer (of the order of 36 months) as more 
tailored plant items are required which will need on-site assembly, as 
well as more permanent structures and larger quantities of pipework 
and interconnections.   
3.3.36 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to have an operational 
life of up to 25 years, after which time it will be decommissioned or re-
powered depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy 
mix at the time. For the purposes of the EIA, it will be assumed that the 
Power Generation Plant will be decommissioned.  
3.3.37 
Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation 
Plant items and restoration of the Power Generation Plant site to a 
similar condition as to when the site was taken over by HPL.  It is likely 
that some underground structures, including the Electrical and Gas 
connections, may be left in situ to avoid any adverse environmental 
impacts associated with their removal.  Due regard would be paid to all 
best practice guidelines on the decommissioning of projects which are 
relevant at the time. Where possible, items of plant would be re-cycled 
or re-used.   
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS) 
3.3.38 
The HPP will be designed to provide a total output of up to 299 
Megawatts Electrical (MWe) (gross capacity) at rated site conditions.  
Directive 2009 /31/EC on the Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide 
(CO2) requires an amendment to Directive 2001/80/EC (LCPD 
Directive) and subsequently Directive 2010/75/EU (the IED) such that 
member states are to ensure that operators of all combustion plants 
with an electrical output of 300MWe or more have assessed the

feasibility of; storage sites, transport facilities and economic 
considerations of the capture of CO2 produced as a result of the 
combustion process.  
3.3.39 
As this does not apply to plants which are sized below 300MWe, in the 
context of the HPP it is not necessary to assess the viability of CO2 
capture and this is not considered further in this Report.   
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
3.3.40 
Plants which have a CHP capability supply power to the National Grid, 
but also supply heat to local businesses through a direct connection to 
waste heat / steam produced as part of the combustion process.  As 
noted at section 4.6  of NPS EN-1, the UK Government seeks that 
applicants give early consideration to CHP viability. 
3.3.41 
Given that it is possible that the Power Generation Plant would be 
designed to operate as a flexible plant, which could be called upon to 
operate at any time of the day, the heat production available for an off-
taker cannot be defined with any certainty.  A preliminary search of 
local businesses in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant site has 
revealed that there are few opportunities to provide to a heat off-taker, 
given the nature of the industrial estate.   
3.3.42 
Notwithstanding these constraints, CHP has not been ruled out and is 
still the subject of active ongoing consultations and investigation to 
confirm its technical and economic potential, in the light of other 
planned development at the Industrial Estate and a further update and 
assessment as necessary will be provided in the DCO application, in 
accordance with Section 4.6 of NPS EN-1 (Consideration of Combined 
Heat and Power (CHP)).  
3.4 
Description of the Gas Connection and Corridor Options 
3.4.1 
The UK National Grid Gas system is split into two parts, the NTS and 
the LTS (Local Transmission System). 
3.4.2 
The NTS represents the infrastructure designed to transmit gas large 
distances around the country, these are generally large diameter 
pipelines (> 24”/600mm) operating at high pressure (~70barg). The 
NTS is the backbone of the UK gas infrastructure and as such does not 
reach all points of mainland Britain; the load driven extremities are 
covered by the LTS. 
3.4.3 
The LTS distributes the gas supply from the NTS to the locations where 
the load requirement is required, these are generally smaller pipelines 
(< 24”/600mm diameter) operating at lower pressure (< 50barg).

3.4.4 
A Gas Connection Feasibility study was undertaken for the HPP in 
December 2012.  The purpose of the study was to define and evaluate 
the options available for connecting the Power Generation Plant to a 
suitable source of fuel gas, and provide a recommendation on the most 
appropriate option for this connection. 
3.4.5 
Preliminary pipeline calculations were performed, including Maximum 
Operating Pressure of the system, Maximum Incidental Pressure, Pipe 
Nominal Diameter, Design Factor, Wall Thickness, Minimum Building 
Proximity Distance and Area Classification; 
3.4.6 
A Crossing / Risk Register has been prepared for each potential 
corridor routeing.  A Level 1 Route Study has been performed for this 
report, which has analysed a specified relevant area of interest for 
archaeological, natural and built environment issues having regard to 
considerations raised in NPS EN-4. 
3.4.7 
Four possible connection points have been identified as being 
potentially suitable locations to connect into the NTS infrastructure.  All 
four options connect to Feeder 2, a 600mm high pressure steel pipeline 
(known as the Garway to Rhigos Pipeline) that passes between the 
village of Hirwaun and the Power Generation Plant site.  No suitable 
connections were identified to the LTS.  
3.4.8 
The Location of Feeder 2 and the four possible connection options are 
shown below in Insert 4.

3.4.9 
Discussions with NGC have confirmed that presently there is enough 
capacity in Feeder 2 to accommodate the loads associated with the 
development of a 299 MWe plant at Hirwaun.  
3.4.10 
There are four route corridor options which are considered suitable to 
connect into the four points shown in Insert 2.  The routes have been 
selected to include a minimal amount of crossings (water, road and rail) 
over the shortest feasible distance. Preliminary route calculations have 
suggested that a steel pipeline 200 mm nominal outside diameter with 
a standard wall thickness of 6.4 mm would be appropriate for this 
project.  
Gas Connection Corridor Option 1 
3.4.11 
The 1st route corridor option (Route 1) is approximately 1.1 km in 
length including 0 major road crossings, 2 minor road crossings, 0 
major water crossings, 6 minor water crossings and 0.19 km of in-road 
mainlaying.  
3.4.12 
The pipeline begins at the Power Generation Plant site heading south 
out of the site immediately turning east, mainlaying (laying pipeline 
beneath the road) down Main Avenue. The route then turns south once 
again passing between industrial buildings until it passes under Rhigos 
Road; a single carriageway that runs along the entire south side of 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  
3.4.13 
The route continues south of Rhigos Road into fields where it would 
cross under a set of overhead lines and continues heading south where 
it then crosses two field drains.  Shortly after the crossing of the second 
field drain the route takes a south easterly turn where it continues 
through the field.   The route is then faced with another field drain 
crossing.  Continuing south easterly, the route heads through a brief 
strip of trees and straight after the trees are another two consecutive 
field drain crossings.  The route then passes under a set of overhead 
lines before reaching the field boundary and A4061.  The route crosses 
under A4061, shortly after which the route turns in a southerly direction. 
3.4.14 
After a short distance the route then turns in an easterly direction once 
again where it makes its final crossing, a field drain. The route reaches 
the NTS east of A4061.

3.4.16 
The route begins at the Power Generation Plant site heading south out 
of the site, immediately turning east, mainlaying down Main Avenue. 
Mid way down Main Avenue the route passes under an overhead 
walkway. The route then continues for a short distance up Main Avenue 
before turning south east through a field and reaches Fifth Avenue.  
3.4.17 
The route then turns south, mainlaying down Fifth Avenue, the single 
carriageway road that runs along part of the eastern boundary to the 
site.  The route then continues being mainlayed across the Rhigos 
Road/A4061 and continues heading south where it crosses under a set 
of overhead lines.  The route continues being mainlayed down Rhigos 
Road/A4061 before leaving the road. 
3.4.18 
The route turns into the field east of the A4061 for a short distance 
before turning back to run south, parallel to the A4061 where it crosses

continues east for about 1km before turning south to connect to the 
NTS west of A4059.   
Insert 8 Gas Connection Corridor Option – Route 4 
 
3.4.26 
All of these route corridors are shown together on Figure 3.  It is noted 
that Figure 3, and the above plans show large buffers or potential areas 
in which each route may be developed.  This is due to the fact that no 
detailed studies have yet been undertaken to assess constraints.  
However, following more detailed studies, the route choices will be 
refined as the project progresses and the options narrowed to a single 
route corridor option.   
3.4.27 
Connection to the NTS at any high pressure pipeline would require two 
above ground facilities to be installed, a Minimum Offtake Connection 
(MOC) facility, which would be owned by NGC, and a PIG Trap Facility 
(PTF) which will be owned by HPL.  The two facilities would contain the 
following pieces of equipment. 
The MOC (approximately 30x30m) would contain: 
� 
Remotely Operable Valve (ROV)

�

� 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk 
� 
Electrical Supply Kiosk. 
3.4.28 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at a PTF on the Hirwaun 
Power Generation Plant site.  This facility would contain the following 
equipment: 
� 
PIG receiving facility; 
� 
Isolation Valve; and 
� 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk.  
3.4.29 
The gas pipeline would be designed, constructed and tested to comply 
with the Institute of Gas Engineers’ (IGE) Recommendations on 
Transmission and Distribution Practice – IGE/TD/1: Edition 5, 2009 - 
Steel Pipelines and Associated Installations for High Pressure Gas 
Transmission (IGE/TD/1). 
3.4.30 
The standard gas pipeline wall thickness would comply with the 
requirements of IGE/TD/1, which defines the minimum safe separation 
distance between a high pressure gas pipeline and normally inhabited 
buildings / major roads / major railways.  This minimum safe separation 
distance is known as the Building Proximity Distance (BPD).  If 
normally inhabited buildings / major roads / major railways are closer 
than 1 BPD (i.e. the gas pipeline is in an area where additional 
protection is required), thicker wall steel pipe (known as proximity pipe) 
would be used.  The exact locations and lengths of where thicker wall 
steel pipe will be used will be confirmed throughout the assessment 
and detailed design stages. 
3.4.31 
The gas pipeline would be buried to a depth of cover which is in 
accordance with recognised industry standards.  For example, depths 
of cover would be: 
� 
No less than 1.2m in agricultural land; 
� 
No less than 2m under road crossings; and

� 
No less than 1.7m under water crossings. 
3.5 
Description of the Electrical Connection and Corridor Options 
3.5.1 
A new connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Power Generation Plant to be exported to the electricity 
transmission network. 
3.5.2 
A  grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Power 
Generation site in 2012.  This assessment was subsequently reviewed 
and updated, also in 2012.  The assessments analysed the 
transmission and distribution grid connection options and determined 
the available thermal and fault level capacity on the electrical network. 
Discussions were also held with NGC.  
3.5.3 
Following discussions with NGC it is proposed that the most suitable 
point of connection for the HPP is at the new 400 kV Rhigos substation, 
which will require a dedicated 400 kV cable of between 60-475m in 
length from the Power Generation Plant to the substation.  This 
substation is expected to be completed by 2016, when the nearby 256 
MW Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm is also due to be connected. 
3.5.4 
Two indicative route corridor options for the electrical connection are 
shown below in Inserts 9 and 10 and also on Figure 3.  It is possible 
that the connection would be via underground cable or overhead line. 
Should an overhead line be required then this would also be within the 
route corridor areas outlined below. An overhead line may be 
considered preferable in order to avoid direct impacts on sensitive 
habitat land. Likewise, an underground cable may be preferable to e.g. 
limit visual impacts. 
3.5.5 
If an overhead line is required, it is also likely that the tower heights 
would range between 35 m and 60 m depending on final design 
requirements

3.6 
Site Selection / Design Evolution  
3.6.1 
The choice of the Power Generation Plant site for the development of a 
299MWe gas fired power station has been the subject of feasibility 
studies undertaken by HPL over a number of months.  Over 600 sites 
have been assessed for their suitability of supporting the development 
of a project of this size.  These site selection studies have assessed a 
number of relevant factors, such as those set out in paragraph 4.4.1 of 
NPS EN-1, in considering a suitable location for the development of a 
plant of this size and type.  
3.6.2 
NPS EN-2 also outlines considerations and factors influencing site 
selection by developers for fossil fuel generating stations, although it 
states that these concerns must be considered by the applicant, and 
that: “…the Government does not seek to direct applicants to particular 
sites for fossil fuel generating stations.” 
3.6.3 
Some of the factors included in the selection of the site at Hirwaun are:  
� 
It is on previously developed industrial land (brownfield site); 
� 
It is in close proximity to a suitable electrical connection point;  
� 
It is in close proximity to a suitable gas connection point; 
� 
It is in an industrial setting, thereby limiting potential impacts on the 
natural and cultural environment and residential amenity; 
� 
It has a well developed road network and site access; and 
� 
There is more than adequate space to develop the Power 
Generation Plant.  
3.6.4 
As stated in Section 3.2 of this Report, the final plant technology choice 
has not yet been determined and is the ongoing subject of more 
detailed engineering and design studies.  These studies will ensure that 
the most suitable plant will be chosen for the site, taking into 
consideration design and environmental considerations, amongst 
others.  
3.6.5 
Similarly, the final route of the Gas Connection has not yet been 
determined, and is the subject of ongoing studies.  A feasibility study 
for the Gas Connection has already been undertaken which has 
narrowed down the potential connection options to four separate 
locations on the NTS Feeder 2, with a possible four different route 
corridors to tie in to these connection points.  
3.6.6 
The final choice of Gas and Electrical Connection route corridors will be 
selected following further consultation and a more thorough 
assessment of constraints and environmental impacts.

SCOPE AND STRUCTURE OF THE EIA 
4.1 
Introduction  
4.1.1 
This section describes the proposed scope and structure for the EIA 
that will be undertaken to support  the DCO application.   
4.1.2 
The key output of the EIA process is the ES, which sets out the 
predicted 
significant 
environmental 
effects 
of 
the 
proposed 
development.  The ES will enable PINS and consultees, and ultimately 
the SoS, to determine whether the proposals (and associated impacts) 
are acceptable. 
4.1.3 
Schedule 4 of the EIA Regulations provides that the ES should 
describe, in particular, the environmental effects on: “Population, fauna, 
flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including 
architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-
relationship between the above factors”.  The structure proposed in this 
document seeks to address all of these requirements.  
4.1.4 
The EIA will be undertaken in full accordance with the EIA Regulations.  
Impacts 
arising 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning will all be considered, as will cumulative impacts with 
other existing and planned developments in the area.  The Gas and 
Electrical Connections may be considered in separate sections to the 
Power Generation Plant. The connections will be fully assessed to the 
extent they form part of the DCO application and, even if separately 
consented, indicative information will be included in the ES. In any 
event, any cumulative impacts which may arise from developing the 
Gas and Electrical Connections at the same time as the Power 
Generation Plant will also be assessed.  
4.2 
Overall ES Structure 
4.2.1 
Table 4.1 sets out the proposed structure of the main ES document.  A 
number of supporting documents will also be submitted to the SoS as 
part of the DCO application. These are summarised in Table 4.2.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ES IMPACT SECTIONS 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This section provides a description of the proposed methodology that 
will be used when undertaking the main impact sections of the ES.  It 
addresses each separate section in turn and describes the current 
understanding of the baseline conditions and the likely impacts and 
assessment methodology for each discipline.  Potential mitigation 
measures have also been identified where appropriate, although these 
will be set out in detail in the ES and will ensure that the project 
complies with current legislation and best practice guidance.  
Consultees are invited to comment on the methodologies within their 
scoping responses. 
5.1.2 
Each section deals with the Power Generation Plant, then the Gas 
Connection  followed by the Electrical Connection. The Gas Connection 
and/or Electrical Connection may be consented separately to the 
Power Generation Plant. If this is the case then Gas Connection and/or 
Electrical Connection would be assessed as required. The below 
sections should therefore be read in this light. 
5.1.3 
The sections described are set out in the following list:  
� 
Air Quality (5.3); 
� 
Noise and Vibration (5.4); 
� 
Ecology (5.5); 
� 
Water Resources (5.6); 
� 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (5.7); 
� 
Landscape and Visual (5.8); 
� 
Waste Management (5.9); 
� 
Traffic, Transport and Access (5.10); 
� 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (5.11); 
� 
Socio-economics (5.12); 
� 
EMF (5.13) and 
� 
Cumulative Impacts (5.14).

significance of environmental 
effects resulting from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning  of the HPP will generally

be assessed in the ES using a series of matrices.  These will be 
developed to describe the sensitivity of receptors which have the 
potential to be impacted by the development and the magnitude of any 
impacts which are likely to arise.  The magnitude of impact and 
sensitivity of receptor will be cross referenced to give an overall 
significance of effect for any potential impact.  Where it is not possible 
to quantify impacts, qualitative assessments will be carried out, based 
on available knowledge and professional judgement.  
5.2.2 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of 
impacts upon different environmental components, the assessments 
will generally follow the structure and use the terminology outlined 
below in Tables 5.1 – 5.3.  However, it is noted here that for some 
impact sections, significance criteria may need to differ depending on 
the conditions encountered at the site.  The criteria will therefore be 
subject to further discussion with statutory consultees.  Each technical 
chapter of the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria 
used.   
5.2.3 
Potential mitigation measures described in the ES will include 
embedded mitigation through design/standard control measures (which 
will be used to produce an initial assessment of impact) and further 
specific mitigation which will be required (which will be taken into 
account to produce an assessment of residual impacts).

Air Quality 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant  
5.3.1 
The air quality assessment of the ES will assess baseline conditions 
(air quality in the local and regional area surrounding the plant), stack 
emissions from the Power Generation Plant (quantifying concentrations 
of emissions) and the most appropriate stack height to achieve 
adequate dispersion of these emissions.  It will also assess localised air 
quality impacts caused during construction and decommissioning.  
5.3.2 
The main emissions associated with the combustion of natural gas at 
the proposed Power Generation Plant are NOx and CO.  Additionally, 
the construction and decommissioning phases of the project have the 
potential to impact on localised air quality, principally through the 
generation of dust and the release of NOx and CO from exhaust fumes 
from increased traffic movements. 
5.3.3 
However, the concentrations of any pollutants released from the plant 
will meet the requirements of the IED.  Furthermore, mitigation 
measures such as flue gas abatement (if deemed necessary) and 
damping down of stockpiles in dry and windy conditions will mean that 
any impacts are sufficiently limited.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.3.4 
This section of the ES will also assess the baseline conditions along 
each of the proposed gas and electrical routes. As there are no 
emissions associated with the operation of gas or Electrical

Connections, there will be no need to access the impacts of these 
elements during operation. However, this section will assess localised 
air quality impacts caused during construction and decommissioning. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.3.5 
Existing ambient air quality and baseline conditions will be reviewed 
using available air quality monitoring data and the most recent local 
authority publications under their duties under the Environment Act 
1995, including particular consideration of designated Air Quality 
Management Areas, any relevant previous studies undertaken in the 
area, the location of sensitive receptors (including designated 
ecological sites) and other significant sources of emissions. 
5.3.6 
In the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant site, other significant 
sources of emissions are considered to be limited to the opencast 
quarry, approximately 2 km south of the site.  Further consultation will 
be sought with RCT and the NRW to determine a definitive list of 
significant emissions sources to consider as part of the assessment of 
air quality. 
5.3.7 
The existing air quality concentrations at sensitive ecological sites will 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
Welsh 
Air 
Quality 
Forum 
(http://www.welshairquality.co.uk).  The existing acid and nutrient 
nitrogen deposition rates will be obtained from the UK Air Pollution 
Information System (UK APIS) (http://www.apis.ac.uk/). 
5.3.8 
The main ecological receptors that have the potential to be impacted by 
NOx emissions (and ultimately nitrogen deposition) from the Power 
Generation Plant owing to their proximity are considered to be: 
� 
Brecon Beacons Nations Park - 0.3km to the north of the site; 
� 
Woodland Park and Pontpren - Site of Special Scientific Interest – 
1.2 km to the northeast of the site; 
� 
Cors Bryn – y – Gaer - Site of Special Scientific Interest – 0.4 km to 
the north of the site; 
� 
Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation – 0.4 km to the north of 
the site; 
� 
Coedydd Nedd a Melte Special Area of Conservation  - 1.4 km to 
the north west of the site; and  
� 
Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Melte Moel Penderyn - Site of Special 
Scientific Interest – 1.4 km to the north west of the site.

5.3.9 
The closest residential receptors to the Power Generation Plant site 
that will also be potentially effected by pollutant dispersion and 
deposition include:  
� 
Property on Rhigos Rd. – approximately 125m south of the site; 
� 
Representative property on Hall Close, approximately 800m west of 
the site; 
� 
Castell Farm – approximately 650m north west of the site; 
� 
Willows Farm - Approximately 460m south east of the site; and  
� 
Tai Cwplau – approximately 800m north of the site.  
Gas Connection 
5.3.10 
As for the Power Generation Plant, ambient air quality and baseline 
conditions will be reviewed using available air quality monitoring data 
and the most recent local authority publications under their duties under 
the Environment Act 1995, including particular consideration of 
designated Air Quality Management Areas, any relevant previous 
studies undertaken in the area, the location of sensitive receptors 
(including designated ecological sites) and other significant sources of 
emissions. 
5.3.11 
Given that all proposed Gas Connection route corridors are within close 
proximity to the Power Generation Plant, no other significant sources of 
emissions have been identified and thus all potential sources are 
considered to be the same as for the Power Generation Plant. 
5.3.12 
As there would be no emissions from the Gas connections, there is no 
potential for NOx to impact upon local ecological or residential sites, 
and the only air quality implications will be associated with the potential 
creation of dust during construction and decommissioning. 
Electrical Connection 
5.3.13 
The assessment methodology of baseline conditions for the Gas 
Connection routes would be appropriate to use for the Electrical 
Connections.  
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant  
5.3.14 
The magnitude and risk of emissions of dust during the construction 
and decommissioning phases will be assessed in accordance with

Guidance on the Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air 
Quality and the Determination of their Significance (IAQM, 2012), as 
will the impact of emissions from the increased number of construction 
vehicles using the methodology prescribed in the Department for 
Transport “Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 
Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality” and the associated DMRB Screening 
Method, developed by the Highways Agency.  The significance of the 
potential impacts identified will be determined based on the sensitivity 
of the identified receptors within the potential zones of influence 
outlined in the IAQM Guidance. 
5.3.15 
The air quality assessment for the operational phase of the project will 
follow the EA documents Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f): Air 
Emissions and the EA Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit 
(AQMAU) “Air dispersion modelling report requirements (for detailed air 
dispersion modelling)”.  The conversion of NOx to NO2, as applicable 
for the protection of human health under the Air Quality Standards 
(Wales) Regulations 2010, will adopt the approach outlined in the 
AQMAU Guidance Note ‘Conversion Ratios for NOx and NO2’ (2006). 
5.3.16 
The atmospheric emissions from the Power Generation Plant will be 
quantified by obtaining information from relevant plant suppliers.  
Where two or more suppliers are being considered, a realistic worst 
case scenario will be used to ensure flexibility.  However, only plant 
that meets national emissions limits will be considered. 
5.3.17 
The atmospheric dispersion modelling will be performed using the 
Cambridge 
Environmental 
Research 
Consultants 
(CERC) 
Air 
Dispersion Modelling Software (ADMS 4.2).  An air dispersion model 
will be set up that will consider the affects of terrain and buildings (as 
appropriate to the location of the plant), together with the most recent 
available meteorological data covering a consecutive five year period 
(e.g. 2008 to 2012, inclusive) in accordance with current guidance. 
5.3.18 
To assess a realistic worst case  scenario, the plant will be modelled 
running at base load, continuously for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 
for a total of 5 years. 
5.3.19 
The exact study and detailed methodology will also be discussed with 
the relevant statutory consultees.  
5.3.20 
The modelling assessment will estimate the mass flow rates of NOx and 
CO at sensitive receptors using the emission limits as specified in the 
Part 2 of Annex V to the IED.  Initial screening runs will be undertaken 
to determine an acceptable stack height suitable for adequate 
dispersion based on maximum short term and long term ground level

concentrations predicted.  Detailed atmospheric dispersion modelling 
will then be undertaken on the basis of the selected stack height. 
5.3.21 
The results of the detailed dispersion modelling will be presented as 
isopleths, and compared with background levels and relevant 
Standards / Guidelines (i.e. the Air Quality Standards (Wales) 
Regulations 2010).  Direct comparison will be made between the long-
term and short-term process contribution from the Power Generation 
Plant, 
the 
predicted environmental 
concentrations of relevant 
substances (i.e. process contribution plus background levels) and the 
limits and objectives within the relevant Air Quality Standards 
Regulations.  Where appropriate, the significance of the potential 
impact will be determined using the criteria set out in the ‘Development 
Control: Planning for Air Quality’ (EPUK, 2010) in conjunction with the 
EA Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f).  The abatement of 
emissions will be discussed in relation to application of Best Available 
Techniques, in accordance with the EA Sector Guidance Note for 
Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01) and the UK position with regards to 
the on-going review of the EU IPPC Reference Document on BAT for 
Large Combustion Plants.  Should additional mitigation prove to be 
necessary, the severity of impact, frequency of emission and the 
resultant environmental risk associated with any residual impact will be 
examined. 
5.3.22 
Changes in air quality levels for NOx will be assessed with respect to 
ecology for the European and nationally designated habitat sites within 
10 km of the Power Generation Plant (including, not necessarily limited 
to, those identified above).  The non-statutory habitat sites within 2 km 
of the Power Generation Plant will also be considered.  An assessment 
of the increased deposition of both nutrient nitrogen and acid due to 
nitrogen will also be carried out at the statutory (both EU and UK) 
designated sites in accordance with the methodologies described in the 
EA AQMAU AQTAG 06 Technical Guidance on detailed modelling 
approach for an appropriate assessment for emissions to air. 
5.3.23 
It is considered that there will not be any noticeable odours associated 
with the operation of the Power Generation Plant at or beyond the 
boundary of the Power Generation Plant site and therefore it is not 
considered necessary to undertake a detailed assessment of odour.  
5.3.24 
The operation of the Gas and Electrical Connections are not anticipated 
to have any impacts on air quality.  However, the methodology 
described above for assessing construction impacts for the Power 
Generation Plant will also be applied for the construction phase of the 
Gas and Electrical Connections.

Gas Connection 
5.3.25 
The operation of the Gas Connection will not produce any emissions to 
air. As stated above the only implication that this element of the project 
will have on air quality is the potential generation of dust during 
construction and decommissioning. This dust is unlikely to have any 
impact upon any local residential or ecological receptors. 
5.3.26 
Nonetheless, the assessment for this element of the work will follow the 
same methodology as that used for assessing construction impacts for 
the Power Generation Plant. 
Electrical Connection 
5.3.27 
The operation of the Electrical Connection will not produce any 
emissions to air. As stated above, the only implication that this element 
of the project will have on air quality is the potential generation of dust 
during construction and decommissioning. This dust is unlikely to have 
any impact upon any local residential or ecological receptors. 
5.3.28 
Nonetheless, the assessment for this element of the work will follow the 
same methodology as that used for assessing construction impacts for 
the Power Generation Plant. 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.3.29 
Embedded mitigation measures that will be employed as part of the 
construction phase of the project will incorporate standard best practice 
working methods and will include; for example, the covering / damping 
down of stockpiles during dry or windy conditions to limit dust 
generation and damping down of any demolition activities which have 
the potential to create large amounts of dust.  A Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will also be drafted which will 
set out best practice methods of limiting dust on site during 
construction. 
5.3.30 
During operation, embedded mitigation measures to limit impacts from 
the Power Generation Plant will include incorporating a stack of 
sufficient height to achieve adequate dispersal of pollutants and flue 
gas cleaning equipment will be used to ensure that all emissions are 
within concentrations permitted by legislation and guidance.  
5.3.31 
The need or otherwise for further, project specific mitigation measures 
will be addressed during the EIA.

Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant  
5.4.1 
In accordance with Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1, a noise and vibration 
assessment will be undertaken and reported in the ES.  This will 
consider all of the potential noise and vibration impacts caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant on sensitive receptors in and around the vicinity of the site.  It will 
be undertaken in accordance with the most relevant national and local 
standards and guidelines. 
Gas Connection 
5.4.2 
Once operational, the Gas Connection will not generate any noise, and 
thus it will only be necessary to consider noise impacts during 
construction and decommissioning. This assessment will consider all 
potential noise and vibration impacts on sensitive receptors along each 
of the proposed route corridors, and will be undertaken in accordance 
with the most relevant national and local standards and guidelines. 
Electrical Connection 
5.4.3 
If the Electrical Connection is via an underground, buried cable, it will 
not generate any noise during operation. Consequently, as above, it will 
only be necessary to consider noise impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. In this case, the assessment will consider all 
potential noise and vibration impacts on sensitive receptors along each 
of the proposed route corridors, and will be undertaken with reference 
to the same relevant national and local standards and guidelines. 
5.4.4 
In the case that the Electrical Connection is via an Overhead Line, 
there is potential that noise will emanate from the line during operation 
in the form of a low frequency ‘hum’. In which case the noise 
assessment of the Electrical Connection will consider all of the potential 
noise and vibration impacts caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the line on sensitive receptors along the total 
length of the route corridor. It will be undertaken in accordance with the 
most relevant national and local standards and guidelines. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.4.5 
The Power Generation Plant will be sited within part of the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate.  The surrounding area is characterised by industrial

units.  The A465 ‘Heads of the Valleys’ Road lies to the north of the site 
and a large opencast mine lies to the south of the site.  These are both 
significant sources of background noise.  
5.4.6 
The closest residential areas to the site are along Hall Close and Hall 
Road, approximately 800m to the west of the site boundary, and in 
Rhigos, approximately 1km south west of the site boundary.  There are 
also numerous individual, isolated properties in the vicinity of the site, 
the closest of which is on Rhigos Road, approximately 125m from the 
southern site boundary.  
Gas Connection 
5.4.7 
The Gas Connection route corridors identified on Figure 3 lie to the 
east of the Power Generation Plant site.  Therefore, they are closer to 
residential properties. (e.g. Gas Connection Route Corridor 1 passes 
adjacent to a property on Rhigos Road).  
5.4.8 
The Electrical Connection route corridor options lie immediately west of 
the Power Generation Plant site. They are therefore situated marginally 
closer to Rhigos, Hall Close and Castell Farm than the Power 
Generation Plant. However, the closest residential property to the 
electrical connection route corridor options is still the property on 
Rhigos Road).  
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant  
5.4.9 
A construction noise and vibration assessment of the  Power 
Generation Plant will be undertaken following the guidance in British 
Standard (BS) 5228: 2009. 
5.4.10 
The assessment of construction impacts will be undertaken as a desk 
study and shall involve:  
� 
Identification of construction activities that produce significant noise 
and vibration;  
� 
Identification of sensitive receptors within 100m of construction 
activities;  
� 
Prediction of noise and vibration using the methodology contained 
within BS5228 2009. 
5.4.11 
The exact construction methodology is unlikely to be defined until the 
construction contractor is appointed, which is likely to be after the DCO 
application is submitted.  However, in the absence of this data, an 
outline construction programme will be developed based on knowledge

and experience of other similar developments.  Additionally, the typical 
make up of construction equipment at each stage of the project 
programme will be ascertained in the same way.  Noise and vibration 
impacts from increased traffic movements as part of the construction 
phase would also be addressed.  For ground improvement works (e.g. 
piling) the noise assessment will pay due regard to the ground 
conditions at the site. Where uncertainties exist, realistic worst case 
assumptions will be used. 
5.4.12 
The quantification of impacts shall be undertaken by comparison with 
agreed project criteria / limits either from previous schemes and 
relevant guidance / standards such as BS5228, BS6472 & BS7385, or 
local legislative requirements.  The desk study shall outline suitable 
measures for the mitigation of construction impacts, and an 
assessment of residual impacts.   
5.4.13 
Operational noise will be assessed using the methodology set out in BS 
4142:1997 ‘Method of Rating Industrial Noise Affecting Mixed 
Residential and Industrial Areas’. This method predicts the likelihood of 
complaints about noise from industrial developments.  It uses the 
following criteria to predict the likelihood of complaints: 
� 
The greater the difference the greater the likelihood of complaints; 
� 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints 
are likely; 
� 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance; and 
� 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely. 
5.4.14 
The noise assessment will also be undertaken in accordance with BS 
7445: 2003 ‘Description and measurement of environmental noise’ 
Parts 1 to 3.  BSI. BS 7445 defines and prescribes best practice during 
recording and reporting of environmental noise.  It is inherently applied 
in all instances when making environmental noise measurements. 
5.4.15 
It is proposed that the study area for the noise assessment of 
operational effects shall be defined as the region within 1000m of the 
Power Generation Plant.  All sensitive receptors, such as residential 
properties, hospitals, schools, etc. within the study areas shall be 
identified in the assessment. 
5.4.16 
A Baseline Noise Survey would then be undertaken in the vicinity of the 
proposed site to establish the current baseline noise levels.  The 
locations for the Baseline Noise Survey (i.e. locations of the Noise

Sensitive Receptors (NSR)) will be agreed in advance with the local 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO).   
5.4.17 
For the purposes of this Report, it is proposed that 5 NSR locations will 
be assessed, consistent with ESs for similar projects in the UK.   
5.4.18 
The closest NSRs to the Hirwaun site, and therefore suggested 
locations for undertaking baseline modelling are:  
� 
Property on Rhigos Rd. – approximately 125m south of the site; 
� 
Representative property on Hall Close - approximately 800m west 
of the site; 
� 
Castell Farm – approximately 650m north west of the site; 
� 
Willows Farm - Approximately 460m south east of the site; and  
� 
Tai Cwplau – approximately 800m north of the site.  
5.4.19 
Noise monitoring will be undertaken during both daytime and night time 
periods.  
5.4.20 
Following baseline noise measurements, a noise model will be 
produced using Cadna software (3-dimensional noise propagation 
software) which will model the measured baseline levels at NSR, 
together with sound power levels of proposed plant (obtained from 
relevant suppliers).  Where sound power levels for proposed plant are 
not available, suitable data will be substituted, although a realistic worst 
case scenario would always be considered.  The noise model will 
highlight the main noise sources and the associated noise levels at the 
NSR locations.   
5.4.21 
Contour plots will be produced clearly showing noise levels at the site, 
NSR and surrounding areas.  
5.4.22 
If the model shows that there is potential for a significant effect to be 
generated by noise from any of the sensitive receptors, the level of 
noise mitigation that would be required would be specified, and 
measures that could be used to achieve this level of mitigation will be 
incorporated into the model, to provide a ‘with mitigation’ scenario. 
5.4.23 
The ES section would be compiled using the Institute of Acoustics 
(IOA) / Institute for Environmental Management (IEMA) draft document 
“Guidelines for Noise Impact Assessment”.  Reference would also be 
made to ensure that the project is compliant with TAN 11 ‘Planning and 
Noise’.

If an overhead line is considered, further assessment will be carried out 
to assess the impact of potential low frequency noise emitted during 
operation of the connection.  
Potential Mitigation Measures 
Power Generation Plant 
5.4.27 
During construction, potential mitigation measures would include the 
use of quietest possible construction equipment and only undertaking 
construction activities during certain hours.  The CEMP will also set out 
best practice methods of limiting noise on site during construction.  
5.4.28 
During operation, mitigation measures would include the use of 
silencers on the loudest plant items, and, if necessary the provision of 
noise screens.  
Gas Connection 
5.4.29 
The mitigation for the construction and decommissioning phase of the 
Power Generation Plant would be appropriate to use for the Gas 
Connection. 
Electrical Connection 
5.4.30 
Assuming that the Electrical Connection is an underground cable, the 
mitigation methodology for the construction and decommissioning 
phase of the Power Generation Plant would be appropriate to use for 
the Electrical Connection.

If an overhead line is considered, mitigation measures could include the 
provision of noise screens.

Ecology  
Introduction  
Power Generation Plant 
5.5.1 
This Section of the ES will address the potential impacts of the Power 
Generation Plant on sensitive ecological receptors.  It would summarise 
the results of Phase 1 extended habitat surveys and any Phase 2 
protected species surveys.  It would also outline any mitigation 
measures considered necessary to limit any identified impacts on 
ecological receptors.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.5.2 
These Sections of the ES will address the potential impacts of the gas 
and Electrical Connections on sensitive ecological receptors. They 
would summarise the results of Phase 1 extended habitat surveys and 
any Phase 2 protected species surveys that have been undertaken 
along the lengths of each proposed route corridor, and would also 
outline any mitigation measures considered necessary to limit any 
identified impacts on ecological receptors..  
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.5.3 
Currently, the area proposed for development of the Power Generation 
Plant is occupied by a large warehouse building surrounded by 
hardstanding and small patches of scrub, grassland and stands of 
trees.  The industrial estate sits within semi-natural surroundings, 
characterised by a mixture of industrial buildings and amenity, scrub 
and semi-improved neutral grassland habitats, bordered by mixed 
plantation woodland and hedgerow / screen planting.   
5.5.4 
A DBA and Extended Phase 1 habitat survey was undertaken at the 
Power Generation Plant site in July 2012 (See Appendix A).  The 
purpose of the assessment and survey were to:  
� 
Identify the main habitats present at the site;  
� 
Identify the sensitive ecological receptors (e.g. statutory designated 
sites) in the vicinity of the site; 
� 
Assess the potential of the site to support protected species; and  
� 
Provide recommendations for further assessment works (e.g. 
Phase 2 Protected Species Surveys).

5.5.5 
The extended Phase 1 habitat survey identified a total of six statutory 
designated sites for nature conservation within a 2km radius of the site.  
These can be summarised as follows: 
� 
BBNP  - 0.3km to the north of the Power Generation Plant site; 
� 
Woodland Park and Pontpren - Site of Special Scientific Interest – 
1.2km to the northeast of the Power Generation Plant site; 
� 
Cors Bryn – y – Gaer - Site of Special Scientific Interest – 0.4km to 
the north of the Power Generation Plant site; 
� 
Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation – 0.4km to the north of 
the Power Generation Plant site; 
� 
Coedydd Nedd a Melte Special Area of Conservation  - 1.4km to 
the north west of the Power Generation Plant site; and  
� 
Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Melte Moel Penderyn - Site of Special 
Scientific Interest – 1.4km to the north west of the Power 
Generation Plant site.  
5.5.6 
These sites are described further in the Ecology Phase 1 survey, which 
is included in Appendix A to this Report.  
5.5.7 
Additionally, the following Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC) have been identified within 2km of the Power Generation Plant 
site:  
� 
Coed Wernhir  
� 
Werfa Farm 
� 
Rhigos Tramway 
� 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
� 
Hirwaun Ponds 
� 
Hirwaun Common 
� 
Hirwaun Iron Works 
5.5.8 
There are records of the following protected species within 1km of the 
Power Generation Plant site:  
� 
Marsh Fritillary butterfly; 
� 
Small pearl bordered fritillary butterfly; 
� 
Barn Owl; 
� 
Peregrine Falcon;

5.5.9 
The main ecological value of the Power Generation Plant site lies with 
the buildings and surrounding plantation woodland, which may provide 
potential roost sites for bats.  An area of unimproved neutral grassland 
in the south of the site is also considered to be species rich and 
considered to be of ecological value.  The woodland habitat on and 
immediately surrounding the site is considered to be of moderate 
potential for badgers and suitable habitat for breeding birds.  Further 
areas of waterlogged grassland (e.g. in the north of the site) may 
provide habitat for reptiles and great crested newts.  
Gas Connection 
5.5.10 
The Gas Connection would run to the east of the Power Generation 
Plant site and connect with Feeder 2.  All of the gas pipeline would be 
undergrounded, albeit that there would be some minor above ground 
structures (as described in Section 3.4 of this Report).  Any one of the 
four potential route corridors, as described in Section 3.4 of this Report, 
would encounter broadly similar conditions.  They would run through 
the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and then across a series of agricultural 
fields.  Two of the routes run alongside main roads and one of the 
routes runs through a stand of trees.  Further details on the routes are 
provided in Section 3.4 of this Report.  
5.5.11 
No Phase 1 habitat survey has yet been undertaken for the Gas 
Connection route corridor.  However, it can been assumed that there is 
the potential for impacts on similar protected species as has been 
identified for the Power Generation Plant site given the similar area and 
surroundings.  Additionally, where a Gas Connection crosses 
watercourses there may be the potential to impact on aquatic species 
(e.g. water voles).  
Electrical Connection  
5.5.12 
The Electrical Connection would run to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant site and would connect into the Rhigos substation. 
We are aware that the areas highlighted as potential route corridors for 
the electrical connection on Figure 3 and Inserts 9 and 10 cross areas 
designated as the Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC and also have the

potential to support a range of species.  However, this area would not 
be directly impacted by the electrical connection. If the area was 
crossed directly, it is likely that this would be via an overhead line, with 
very limited construction works within the SINC. If an underground 
cable was preferred, this would be routed to the north of Power 
Generation Plant and along the A465 or to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant site along Main Avenue and Fourteenth Avenue. In 
both instances direct impact on the SINC would be avoided.  
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.5.13 
NPS EN-1 requires that “Where the development is subject to EIA the 
applicant should ensure that the ES clearly sets out any effects on 
internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological or 
geological conservation importance, on protected species and on 
habitats and other species identified as being of principal importance 
for the conservation of biodiversity” (paragraph 5.3.3). Furthermore,  
that ‘the applicant should show how the project has taken advantage of 
opportunities to conserve and enhance biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests’ (paragraph 5.3.4) and demonstrate that 
‘opportunities will be taken to enhance existing habitats and, where 
practicable, to create new habitats’ (paragraph 5.3.18).   
5.5.14 
NPS EN-1 also requires that lighting effects will be considered on 
sensitive ecological receptors.  
5.5.15 
Based on the results of the extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, there is 
a recommendation to undertake the following Phase 2 protected 
species surveys at the Power Generation Plant site: 
Bats 
5.5.16 
Within the extended Phase 1 Habitat survey, three buildings were 
identified with potential to be used by bats for roosting.  One of these 
buildings is located within the footprint of the proposed Power 
Generation Plant, whilst the other two are within 50m of the proposed 
footprint of the Power Generation Plant.  It is therefore recommended 
that all three buildings will be subject to internal and external surveys 
followed by three dusk emergence and one dawn re-entry survey.   
5.5.17 
The surveys would be carried out by a CCW licensed bat worker and 
would be undertaken following consultation with the RCT Ecologist.  
Surveys would be undertaken during optimal survey period for bats 
(April to September).

- 91 - 
 
 
5.5.18 
In addition, three bat activity transect surveys will be carried out across 
the entire Power Generation Plant site during optimal survey period for 
bats (April to September) to identify which bat species are using the 
site and to investigate how they are using the different habitats for 
roosting, feeding, foraging, commuting and socialising wherever 
possible.  All surveys will be undertaken by licensed bat workers and 
experienced bat surveyors equipped with bat detectors and recording 
devices.  The surveys will also be undertaken in accordance with best 
practice guidelines (Bat Conservation Trust, 2012). 
Badgers 
5.5.19 
Suitable habitat for badgers was identified within 30m of the proposed 
footprint of the Power Generation Plant, although no evidence of 
badgers was observed within the site during the Phase 1 Habitat 
survey.   
5.5.20 
It is proposed that a presence/absence survey is undertaken at the site 
to further assess the potential of impacting on badgers.  The survey will 
be based on the standard approach detailed in Surveying Badgers 
(Harris et al., 1989)3 and used during the National Badger Survey 
(Cresswell et al., 1990)4.  Particular emphasis will be placed on locating 
badger setts and signs of territorial activity.  This will involve searching 
for field signs associated with badgers.  Surveys will be undertaken 
during the optimal survey period, which runs between February and 
May. 
Method Statement SINC 
5.5.21 
A method statement will be produced for all works that might impact on 
the neighbouring Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC to protect the 
designating features of the SINC from adverse affects from the 
proposed development.  
5.5.22 
Based on the current Power Generation Plant layout (Figure 2), it is 
considered that there is not a requirement for Phase 2 protected 
species surveys for Great Crested Newts (GCN), National Vegetation 
Classification (NVC) or invertebrates.  However, if there are any 
changes to the proposed layout that resulted in development areas 
encroaching into areas with the potential to support these species, 
further methodology would be provided to and discussed with statutory 
consultees.

Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.5.23 
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Surveys will be undertaken along potentially 
suitable Gas Connection route corridors and the proposed Electrical 
Connection route corridors. The corridors will encompass a suitable 
buffer either side of the proposed routes to account for small variations 
in the final route (micrositing) and to account for the ‘working width’ (i.e. 
the area required for vehicle movements and laydown of equipment).  
The surveys will be undertaken using the same methodology and aims 
as for the Power Generation Plant site and will help to define the final 
route corridor choices.  
5.5.24 
The results of the Phase 1 surveys would identify the requirement for 
Phase 2 protected Species Surveys.  As yet, the need, or otherwise for 
specific surveys cannot be determined with any certainty.   
5.5.25 
Following the completion of the Phase 2 Protected Species Surveys, 
reports will be produced, detailing the extent to which the species are 
present, the likely impacts that the Hirwaun Power Project will have on 
species and habitats and the potential mitigation measures that could 
be employed to reduce impacts to an acceptable level.  
5.5.26 
Assessment and reporting will follow guidelines as set out in the 
Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) (IEEM, July 2006). 
5.5.27 
All results would be compiled and presented in an ES chapter.  
Appropriate Assessment 
5.5.28 
If it is found that the development of the HPP will have a Likely 
Significant Effect (LSE) on the nearby ecologically designated sites (e.g 
Blaen Cynon SAC)), sufficient information will be provided in a 
‘Statement to Inform an Appropriate Assessment’ of the impact of the 
project on these ecologically designated sites, in accordance with the 
Habitat Regulations. 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.5.29 
Embedded mitigation measures to limit impacts on ecology and 
biodiversity could include ensuring that no construction takes place 
within breeding bird season or during other sensitive ecological 
seasons.  If necessary, further, specific mitigation measures will include 
the consideration for provision of new habitat to suitably replace any 
habitat areas which are permanently lost through development of the 
Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection or Electrical Connection.

5.6 
Water Resources 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.1 
This section of the ES will describe the potential impacts resulting from 
the development of the Power Generation Plant on local water quality.  
The Section will also provide a brief summary of the main issues and 
risks posed to and from flooding.  However,  these will be assessed in 
detail through a separate Flood Risk Assessment, submitted as a 
separate dedicated document as part of the DCO application.  
Additionally, potential impacts on hydrogeology will be assessed as 
part of the section describing geology, contamination and ground 
conditions (outlined in Section 5.7 of this Report).  
5.6.2 
The supply of water for construction of the HPP will ultimately be the 
responsibility of the principal construction contractor.  In addition, the 
discharge of any effluents during construction, including site drainage, 
will also be the responsibility of the principal construction contractor 
who will be required to reach agreement with NRW, Internal Drainage 
Board (IDB) and the local sewerage undertakers with regards to 
detailed methods of disposal.  Standard good working practices should 
ensure that any impacts due to water discharging from the site would 
be insignificant.   
5.6.3 
At present, it is assumed that the Power Generation Plant will utilise air 
cooling, substantially reducing water intake, as described in Section 3.2 
above.  During natural gas firing, the only process water required on a 
day-to-day basis would be that for make-up to the HRSG system 
(should CCGT plant be chosen). 
5.6.4 
Small quantities of water (blowdown) will be discharged to avoid the 
build-up of impurities in the HRSG steam/water cycle.  The blowdown is 
virtually pure water containing very small quantities of various 
chemicals that are used to prevent corrosion and scaling in the system. 
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.6.5 
Separate sections of the ES will describe the potential impacts resulting 
from the development of the Gas and Electrical Connections on local 
water quality.  As above, any impact of Flood Risk and Ground Water 
will be assessed in separate sections.  
5.6.6 
As there is no requirement for water usage during the operation of the 
Gas and Electrical (buried or overhead) Connections, the only 
consideration of water resources will be during the construction period,

and will follow the same principles as those described for construction 
of the Power Generation Plant. 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.7 
Surface water bodies in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant will 
be identified and described along with their importance.  Based on an 
initial, high level assessment, the main water bodies are considered to 
be: 
� 
Penderyn Reservoir – approximately 800m north of the site; 
� 
Numerous drainage ditches and several small ponds on agricultural 
land to the south of Rhigos Road – approximately 400-500m south 
of the site; and  
� 
Hirwaun Ponds – approximately 1km to the east of the site. 
Gas Connection 
5.6.8 
None of the proposed Gas Connection route corridors (as described in 
Section 3.3 of this Report) require crossing over a large watercourse.  
Two of the proposed route corridors (routes 1 and 3) require crossing 6 
and 5 minor field drains respectively.  These field drains are all located 
on agricultural land to the east of the Power Generation Plant site.  
Electrical Connection 
5.6.9 
The Electrical Connection would not cross any watercourses.  It may 
cross over a waterlogged area to the north and west of the Power 
Generation Plant site boundary. However, if this is the case, it is likely 
that an overhead line will be preferred.  
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant 
5.6.10 
NPS EN1 recognises the need for EIA to account for the existing status 
of, and impacts of the proposed project on, water quality, water 
resources and physical characteristics of the water environment 
(paragraph 5.15.2). 
5.6.11 
NPS EN1 Paragraph 5.2.7 also states that the ES should describe any 
potential eutrophication impacts. 
5.6.12 
The Water Resources ES chapter for the Power Generation Plant 
would be undertaken using a risk based approach to determine the 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Environmental

level of potential impacts but will also use a Source–Pathway-Receptor 
model to identify which receptors could realistically be impacted by a 
given action. 
5.6.13 
All aspects of supply, demand and disposal of water and process 
effluents will be addressed for the construction, operational and 
decommissioning phases of the project.  
5.6.14 
Any potential sources of pollution which have the potential to impact on 
surface water bodies will be identified.   
5.6.15 
The disposal of surface water drainage and the process effluents to the 
sewage system will be discussed with a view to maximising the 
opportunities for water recovery and re-use as far as is practicable. 
5.6.16 
Potential discharge locations for site surface waters and process waste 
waters will be identified and a site drainage plan incorporating a 
sustainable drainage system (SuDS) will be discussed at a high level. 
5.6.17 
In terms of the Power Generation Plant, there are not anticipated to be 
any impacts on the water bodies listed above.  The majority of them are 
a significant distance from the site and therefore will not be directly 
impacted during construction.  It is not anticipated to directly abstract or 
discharge water to or from any of these sources during construction, 
operation or decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant.  
5.6.18 
Where projects are away from, or unlikely to interact with any water 
courses, it is likely that a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report will 
not be required and it may be scoped out.  However, if NRW does state 
that a WFD Report is required, this will need to be incorporated.  The 
assessment for the WFD Report will involve consideration of the WFD 
Status of surrounding water bodies.  The WFD Report must be 
approved by NRW and would form an Appendix to the ES. 
5.6.19 
As part of further baseline assessment, abstraction points and licences 
in the area will be investigated and summarised, and the potential 
impact on these abstractions will be qualified.   
5.6.20 
Historical maps would be studied to identify the course of any former 
watercourses which may have been undergrounded or culverted in the 
past and which could be impacted.  
Gas Connection  
5.6.21 
The assessment methodology for the Power Generation Plant would be 
appropriate to use for the Gas Connection.

5.6.22 
During construction of the Gas Connection, best practice working 
methods will be utilised at all water crossings to ensure that there are 
no impacts on flow or drainage and that no contamination is allowed to 
enter the drainage ditches.  
Electrical Connection  
5.6.23 
Neither of the electrical route corridor options (either overhead line or 
underground cable) require any water crossings or interaction with 
water bodies of any kind.  
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.6.24 
Potential embedded mitigation measures which will be included during 
the construction of the HPP to limit impacts on water quality include 
siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to avoid 
pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working guidelines to 
avoid spillages near watercourses.   
5.6.25 
Additionally, during construction and operation, silt traps and oil 
interceptors would be placed in any drains on site.  No untreated 
surface or waste waters would be allowed to drain to drainage ditches 
or watercourses during construction or operation.  
5.6.26 
Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems would be used if practical. 
5.6.27 
The British Standard Code of Practice for Earthworks BS 6031:1981 
contains detailed methods that should be considered for the general 
control of drainage on construction sites.  Further advice is also 
available in the British Standard Code of Practice for Foundations 
BS 8004: 1086.  These will be taken into account.   
5.6.28 
All aqueous process effluents will be discharged via the plant drainage 
systems and will be in accordance with EA limits.  The use of biocides 
will be optimised to ensure that the least amount possible is required.   
5.6.29 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored 
will be surrounded by an impermeable bund.  Single tanks will be within 
bunds sized to contain 110% of capacity and multiple tanks or drums 
will be within bunds sized to contain the greater of 110 per cent of the 
capacity of the largest tank or 25 per cent of the total tanks contents.   
5.6.30 
During operation, NRW will set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the site under the Environmental Permit.  The need, or 
otherwise for further, specific mitigation measures will be determined 
through the EIA process.

Geology, Ground Conditions and Land Use 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant  
5.7.1 
This section of the ES will detail the baseline geological and 
hydrogeological conditions of the Power Generation Plant site and 
outline the potential environmental impacts of the proposed Power 
Generation Plant on these resources.  It will also detail the baseline 
conditions in terms of ground and ground water contamination and the 
risks posed to human health (particularly future site users).  It will also 
consider any impacts that the project may have on the physical 
geological, soil or agricultural resource, through e.g. removal of rare 
geology, sterilisation of mineral assets, removal of good quality 
agricultural land or disturbance of sites designated for their geological 
importance and significance.   
5.7.2 
The main potential impact from the development of the Power 
Generation Plant in terms of geology and land quality is the 
mobilisation of existing contaminants which may be present at the site. 
Gas and Electrical Connections  
5.7.3 
As above, the ES sections describing the geology, land use and 
hydrogeology of the gas and electrical route corridors will follow the 
same structure as described for the Power Generation Plant.  
5.7.4 
The main potential impact from the development of the Gas Connection 
is likely to be the potential sterilisation of good quality agricultural land.  
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.7.5 
It is understood that prior to the development of the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate, the area proposed for the Power Generation Plant was open 
agricultural land.  The site to be developed for the Power Generation 
Plant is currently occupied by a large distribution warehouse.   
5.7.6 
Key developments in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant in 
terms of geology and contamination include: 
� 
Former Armaments Factory, previously located in Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate; 
� 
Tower Opencast Quarry  - approximately 1km to the south of the 
Power Generation Plant site;  
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Environmental 
Impact Assessment Scoping Report

- 98 - 
 
 
� 
Former Tower Colliery, Rhigos – approximately 1.5km south of the 
Power Generation plant site; 
� 
Disused ‘pits’ which now form part of Hirwaun Ponds – 
approximately 800m west of the Power Generation Plant site; and  
� 
Ironworks in Hirwaun – 2km east of the Power Generation Plant 
site.  
5.7.7 
The area in the vicinity of the  Power Generation Plant is known to have 
been the subject of mining for coal, iron ore and limestone.  The Tower 
Colliery was the oldest continuously worked deep coal mine in the UK 
which closed in 2008 and during its operational life, worked up to 14 
underground seams.  
5.7.8 
Further deep mines are situated in the vicinity of the site and recently 
opencast mining has started at the Tower Colliery site. 
5.7.9 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial 
geology of the area is a mixture of till (poorly sorted clay, sand and 
gravel) and waterlogged peat deposits.  
5.7.10 
Bedrock geology comprises the South Wales Lower coal measures 
formation – including a mixture of mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.  
5.7.11 
The Lower Coal Measures have been classed as a Secondary Aquifer 
B, meaning that they are moderately productive in terms of 
groundwater flow.  
Gas Connection 
5.7.12 
The Gas Connection would run to the east of the Power Generation 
Plant site, mainly across agricultural fields and adjacent to roads.  
5.7.13 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial and 
hard rock geology underlying the Gas Connection route corridors is the 
same as that underlying the Power Generation Plant. 
5.7.14 
Unlike the Power Generation Plant, the main impact of the Gas 
Connection is likely to be the sterilisation of agricultural land.  
Electrical Connection  
5.7.15 
The Electrical Connection would run to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant site. if underground, it would run across land similar to 
that surrounding the Power Generation Plant site (e.g. hardstanding, 
scrub and adjacent to roads).

5.7.16 
British Geological Survey (BGS) maps indicate that the superficial and 
hard rock geology underlying the Electrical Connection route corridors 
is the same as that underlying the Power Generation Plant. 
5.7.17 
Similar to the Power Generation Plant, the main impact of the Electrical 
Connection is likely to be the mobilisation of any existing 
contamination.  
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant  
5.7.18 
Assessment will be underpinned by the DEFRA/EA publication 
Contaminated Land Report 11, 2004, “Model Procedures for the 
Management of Land Contamination” and associated subsequent 
guidance. 
5.7.19 
The assessment approach will be undertaken with a clear 
understanding of the following: 
� 
Previous land uses – through a review of historical maps;  
� 
Underlying ground conditions – through a review of BGS maps, 
and a review of previous site investigations (where available) and 
a Coal Authority Report;  
� 
Existing physical baseline conditions through a site walkover 
survey and review of a Landmark Envirocheck Report.   
5.7.20 
The Landmark Envirocheck Report for the site will identify groundwater 
vulnerability, sites designated for geological importance, details of any 
previous pollution events at the site or surrounding area, details of 
landfills, waste management sites and COMAH sites within the site and 
surrounding area and historical maps.  
5.7.21 
A conceptual site model approach will be used to assess the risks 
posed by contaminants to sensitive receptors using a source, pathway 
receptor model, based on the following: 
� 
Source – potential source of contamination. 
� 
Pathway – means by which contamination can reach and impact 
upon a receptor. 
� 
Receptor – that which may be adversely affected by the presence 
of contamination.   
5.7.22 
Desk studies will identify potential environmental and geotechnical 
liabilities associated with the development of the site, including an 
assessment of potential impacts of previous uses of the site and

surrounding area.  These desk studies are important if any potential 
environmental and geotechnical risks are to be identified, and a 
focussed and cost efficient intrusive investigation is to be designed (if 
required).   
5.7.23 
In undertaking the desk studies, all available information on the sites 
and surrounding areas will be reviewed to establish local ground 
conditions and the environmental settings.  Furthermore, consultation 
will be held with the relevant Local Authorities and NRW to obtain any 
other environmental records available for the project sites and to further 
refine the assessment methodology.  
5.7.24 
A site walkover will be undertaken, covering the project site and 
immediate surrounding areas.  This will ensure all potential source, 
pathway and receptor linkages for potential contamination issues have 
been identified.   
5.7.25 
Based on the findings of the desk studies, site walkovers and 
preliminary risk assessment, recommendations will be provided for any 
further intrusive investigation work thought to be necessary to satisfy 
current Standards / Guidance and fill any data gaps identified to fully 
inform the assessments of environmental and geotechnical risks / 
liabilities.   
5.7.26 
Using the information obtained suitable remediation strategies would be 
developed that could be implemented to render the site ready for 
development as appropriate.   
5.7.27 
These would include estimates of the types and volumes of waste 
material that will need to be removed from the sites prior to 
development.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.7.28 
The assessment methodology of the Power Generation Plant would be 
appropriate for use on both the gas and Electrical Connection route 
corridors and will be followed as described above. 
5.7.29 
Additionally, an assessment will be made of the amount of agricultural 
land, if any, that may become sterilised as a result of the development 
of the Gas Connection.  
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.7.30 
Embedded mitigation measures will include adherence to good practice 
guidelines and could involve, for example,

� 
Any additional soil materials that are to be imported to the sites will 
be required to have certification of their chemical concentrations to 
ensure that contaminative materials are not being introduced to the 
area.   
� 
In order to further limit disturbance, the site access tracks will be 
constructed first to allow movement of vehicles around the site on 
areas of soft-standing.   
� 
Any vegetation, topsoil and subsoil will be removed to expose a 
suitable sub-grade.  Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for 
reuse will be stockpiled on impermeable liners.   
� 
Soils which are to be reused onsite will be tested for contamination 
and geotechnical suitability.  This will form part of a site waste 
management plan (SWMP) which will be drafted prior to 
construction and will focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of 
waste spoil.  
� 
Surface water, perched waters or groundwater from dewatering 
operations will not be discharged to surface water, foul or surface 
water drains without the appropriate consents from the local water 
or sewage company and / or NRW.   
� 
The disposal of this effluent will be the responsibility of the 
contractor.  If necessary, this water will be tanked off-site for 
disposal at a suitable facility.   
� 
All foundations will be appropriately specified to resist chemical 
attack from soils or groundwater.  
� 
Foundations will also be designed so as not to present a 
preferential pathway for contaminant migration, if present at the 
Power Generation Plant site.  
5.7.31 
Further, specific mitigation measures could include, for example, 
remediation of the site, removal of contamination hotspots or further 
site characterisation and will be determined during the EIA.  
5.8 
Landscape and Visual 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant  
5.8.1 
This section of the ES will describe the potential impacts that the Power 
Generation Plant could have on landscape elements and sensitive 
visual receptors in the surrounding area.  
5.8.2 
This Section will establish the following:

- 102 - 
 
 
� 
A clear understanding of the land affected by the HPP and its wider 
landscape setting, identifying its landscape character, resources, 
value and sensitivity to the proposed development; 
� 
An assessment of the composition, character and aesthetic value 
of views from visual receptors including occupiers of residential 
properties and people using amenity landscapes, and the  
sensitivity of views;  
� 
The nature of the different development scenarios and mitigation 
measures; and 
� 
The likely significant direct and indirect effects of the proposal on 
the landscape resource (i.e. landscape elements and character) 
and on visual receptors. 
5.8.3 
The buildings of the Power Generation Plant will be finished in a 
manner which will have regard to the views of community and 
stakeholder consultation to minimise the impact with respect to the 
landscape.  Attention will be paid at all times to aspects of good design 
that can be incorporated into the project to minimise visual impacts and 
identify reasonable mitigation where possible and appropriate in line 
with NPS EN-1.  Consideration will also be given to the potential 
impacts of lighting arising from the Power Generation Plant and 
measures will be put forward to limit the amount of offsite light spill.  
Gas Connection  
5.8.4 
It is not anticipated that the Gas Connection will give rise to significant 
visual impacts, as it will be undergrounded for the majority of its length.  
Nevertheless, assessment will be made of the potential impact of any 
above ground structures (e.g. substation and AGI).  
Electrical Connection 
5.8.5 
As for the Gas Connection, is not anticipated that a buried Electrical 
Connection would give rise to any significant visual impacts, as it will be 
undergrounded for the majority of its length.  
5.8.6 
However, there is the potential that an overhead line may be used to 
export the electricity from the Power Generation Plant to the National 
Grid. If this is the case, a full landscape and visual impact assessment 
will be undertaken in line with EN-1 and the additional guidance set out 
in EN-5, ensuring that the assessment conforms to all of the ‘Holford 
Rules’ as far as possible. 
5.8.7 
Furthermore, whether the Electrical Connection takes the form of an 
underground cable or an overhead line, some element of above ground

infrastructure will be required where the connection joins the National 
Grid infrastructure. 
5.8.8 
Irrespective of the type of connection, a full visual impact assessment 
of this infrastructure will be carried out following the guide lines set out 
in EN-1 and EN-5 
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.8.9 
Land surrounding the Power Generation Plant site is characterised by a 
mixture of industrial units, scrub grassland and plantation woodland.  
The A465 ‘Heads of the Valleys’ Road runs approximately 100m north 
of the site and the Tower Colliery is approximately 1km south of the 
site. The closest residential receptors to the site include   
� 
Rhigos (1.3km south west); 
� 
Hirwaun (1.4km east); and 
� 
Penderyn (1.8km north).  
5.8.10 
Although the area immediately surrounding the proposed Power 
Generation Plant is characterised by industrial development, the wider 
landscape is made up of open countryside with rolling hills and 
agricultural 
landholdings. 
Furthermore, 
the 
BBNP 
is 
situated 
approximately 0.3km to the north of the Power Generation Plant site at 
its closest point.  The Power Generation Plant will be viewed in the 
context of surrounding industrial developments and with the 46.8 sq.km 
Pen y Cymoedd wind farm on higher ground 5km beyond, although it is 
appreciated that there is the potential for the project to have impacts on 
the landscape character and visual amenity of wider surrounding area. 
As such, a great proportion of the assessment will focus on potential 
impacts to this more rural setting and the protected landscape of the 
BBNP.  
Gas Connection  
5.8.11 
The Gas Connection will run to the east of the Power Generation Plant 
site, crossing a mixture of agricultural and urban land. The general land 
use pattern is as described above for the Power Generation Plant, 
although some of the route corridor options pass closer to residential 
receptors than the Power Generation Plant (e.g. Gas Connection Route 
Corridor 1 passes adjacent to a property on Rhigos Road.).  
Electrical Connection 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Environmental 
Impact Assessment Scoping Report

- 104 - 
 
 
5.8.12 
The Electrical Connection would run to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant site over a very short length.  The general land use 
pattern and closest residential receptors are as described above for the 
Power Generation Plant.  
5.8.13 
Should an overhead line Electrical Connection be the preferred option, 
the visual impact would be considerably greater, and it would likely be 
visible from number of viewpoints. 
Assessment 
Power Generation Plant  
5.8.14 
NPS EN-1 states that National Parks, together with the Broads and 
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), have been confirmed 
by the Government as having the highest status of protection in relation 
to landscape and scenic beauty. Where decisions may directly affect 
such areas, paragraph 5.9.9 requires the SoS to have regard to the 
statutory purposes of the potentially affected area/s. The statutory 
duties are provided for in Section 11A(2) of the National Parks and 
Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (National Parks), Section 17A of 
the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 (The Broads) and Section 85 
of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (AONBs). 
5.8.15 
NPS EN-1 confirms that the duty to have regard to the purposes of 
nationally designated areas also applies when considering applications 
for projects outside the boundaries of these areas which may have 
impacts within them. EN-1 confirms “That the aim should be to avoid 
compromising the purposes of designation and such projects should be 
designed sensitively given the various siting, operational, and other 
relevant constraints” (paragraph 5.9.12).  
5.8.16 
Additionally, Paragraph 5.9.13 of EN-1 states that the fact that a 
proposed project is visible from within a designated area should not in 
itself be a reason for refusing consent. 
5.8.17 
With respect to the landscape and visual impacts ‘of thermal 
combustion generating stations, the IPC [decision maker] should 
presume that the adverse impacts would be less if a hybrid or direct 
cooling system is used and that developers will use BAT [best available 
techniques] (paragraph 5.9.4)’ EN-2 notes that ‘It is not possible to 
eliminate the visual impacts associated with a fossil fuel generating 
station’ and so mitigation will be reducing such impacts as practicable 
(paragraph 2.6.5).  
5.8.18 
The assessment will include:

� 
A desk review of all relevant documents and landscape planning 
policy and guidance;  
� 
A field survey to assess baseline landscape character and visual 
amenity; 
� 
A description of the key features associated with the development 
that has the potential to alter the characteristics of the landscape 
and visual baseline; 
� 
Appropriate generic and site specific mitigation that is reasonable 
and possible;  
� 
Assessment of the predicted significance of residual effects on the 
landscape resource / character and visual amenity and compliance 
with landscape policy; and 
� 
An assessment of cumulative effects arising from the proposal, in 
combination 
with 
other 
proposed 
large 
scale 
industrial 
developments in the locality.  
5.8.19 
The landscape assessment will be undertaken using methodology set 
out in the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 
(Landscape Institute and Institute of Environmental Management and 
Assessment, 2nd Edition, 2002) (“Landscape Institute’s Guidelines”) 
and Countryside Council for Wales/Cadw (2007) Guide to Good 
Practice on Using the Register of Landscapes of Historic Interest in 
Wales in the Planning and Development Process. 
5.8.20 
The following stages are undertaken in the assessment:  
� 
Desk study and preliminary site survey; 
� 
Baseline assessment (consisting of desk study, field survey and 
reporting); 
� 
Assessment of effects on the perception of the landscape;  
� 
Assessment of residual visual effects; 
� 
Conclusions on overall landscape and visual amenity effects. 
5.8.21 
Initially, a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan will be generated for 
the Power Generation Plant using specialist software.  The ZTV will 
show a maximum theoretical visibility of the project across the 
surrounding area.  The ZTV will be based solely on topography and 
proposed height of the plant envelope.  No allowance will be made for 
intervening screening vegetation or buildings, although in practice this 
tends to have a substantial mitigating effect.

5.8.22 
A desk top review of all relevant planning policy and LANDMAP (the 
national information system, devised by CCW, for taking landscape into 
account in decision-making) will be undertaken.  Particular attention will 
be paid to the BBNP, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Areas of 
High Landscape Value, and popular tourist spots and viewpoints.   
5.8.23 
The Power Generation Plant will be discussed in detail including 
dimensions of the larger buildings, the stack heights, and any other 
ancillary infrastructure that may have an impact on the landscape. 
5.8.24 
To assist in the impact assessment, a site visit will be made by a 
qualified landscape architect, who will assess the study area in detail.  
Additionally, and following engagement with relevant stakeholders, a 
selection of photomontages will be taken from key sensitive viewpoints 
(e.g. residential receptors, designated ecological sites, cultural heritage 
assets, key rights of way).  
5.8.25 
Photomontages would be produced with reference to ‘Photography and 
photomontage in landscape and visual impact assessment Landscape 
Institute Advice Note 01/11’. 
5.8.26 
An appropriate number and choice of viewpoints will be selected for the 
actual assessment. It is proposed that up to six photomontages would 
be produced to illustrate the development from key views.  Suggested 
viewpoint locations for photomontages are: 
� 
Hall Road – (approximately 800m west) to represent Hall Road and 
Hall Close; 
� 
Heol Y Graig Road - Rhigos (approximately 1km south west) to 
represent Rhigos, users of the main road out of Rhigos and Rhigos 
Primary School; 
� 
Views from the A4059 - where it crosses over the Railway line near 
Hirwaun (1.2km east) to represent views from Hirwaun and the 
A4059; 
� 
Pontbren Llwyd (2 km north) – to represent views of residential 
properties; 
� 
Pendryn (2.5 km north) – to represent residential properties; and  
� 
BBNP (0.3km north of the site) - to represent amenity users.  
5.8.27 
The photomontages will show a representation of how the proposed 
Power Generation Plant envelope would be viewed within the 
landscape and will be used to inform the assessment of the impact of 
the development.  
Gas Connection

5.8.28 
Given that the majority of the Gas Connection will be underground, the 
landscape and visual impact assessment for this element of the work 
will focus solely on the impact of the AGI.  
5.8.29 
This will follow the methodology described above and will be carried out 
in parallel, where possible, using the same view point locations and 
incorporating both elements of the project on photomontages where 
they will be visible in the same view. 
Electrical Connection 
5.8.30 
As for the Gas Connection, if the underground Electrical Connection is 
carried forward, then the LVIA for this element of the work will focus 
solely on the cumulative impact of above ground structures (e.g. the 
substation).  
5.8.31 
If an overhead line is taken forward, the assessment will follow the 
standard LVIA methodology as described above, but will make 
reference to the Holford and Horlock rules and EN-5 where appropriate.  
Potential Mitigation Measures  
Power Generation Plant  
5.8.32 
During construction and decommissioning, embedded mitigation 
measures could include the careful consideration of siting of stockpiles 
and cranes to avoid detrimental impacts on the visual amenity of 
closest receptors. 
5.8.33 
During operation, the main embedded mitigation measures will be the 
careful siting and arrangement of plant.  The final architectural design 
of the buildings will be carefully considered to provide a high standard 
of visual amenity, given practical and economic constraints. 
5.8.34 
The external structures will be designed such that there will be minimal 
deterioration in the appearance over time.  
5.8.35 
Further, detailed mitigation measures could include the consideration 
for on site or off-site screen planting to screen views of the Power 
Generation Plant.  
5.8.36 
Due regard will be paid to NPS EN-1 and EN-2 and the guidance they 
provide on ‘good design’.  
Gas Connection  
5.8.37 
The mitigation for the Gas AGI is anticipated to be the same as that 
described above for the Power Generation Plant.

Electrical Connection 
5.8.38 
Regardless of if an underground or overhead electrical connection is 
progressed, mitigation will follow principles of good design as described 
in EN-5. For an overhead line this would include: 
� 
Avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of highest amenity 
value, by so planning the general route of the line in the first place, 
even if total mileage is somewhat increased in consequence; 
� 
Avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest by 
deviation, provided this can be done without using too many angle 
towers, i.e. the bigger structures which are used when lines change 
direction; 
� 
Other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp 
changes of direction and thus with fewer angle towers; 
� 
Choose tree and hill backgrounds in preference to sky backgrounds 
wherever possible. When a line has to cross a ridge, secure this 
opaque background as long as possible, cross obliquely when a dip 
in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross 
directly, preferably between belts of trees; 
� 
Prefer moderately open valleys with woods where the apparent 
height of towers will be reduced, and views of the line will be 
broken by trees; 
� 
Where country is flat and sparsely planted, keep the high voltage 
lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging 
routes, distribution poles and other masts, wires and cables, so as 
to avoid a concentration of lines or “wirescape”; and 
� 
Approach urban areas through industrial zones, where they exist; 
and when pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes 
between the approach line and the substation, carefully assess the 
comparative costs of undergrounding.

Waste Management  
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant  
5.9.1 
There are three main phases of the development of the Power 
Generation Plant where solid waste arisings will occur; these are: 
construction (including demolition of existing structures and site 
preparation), operation and decommissioning.

5.9.2 
During construction and decommissioning, it is likely that wastes such 
as concrete, inert builders rubble, spoil and scrap metal will be 
produced. 
5.9.3 
Solid waste from the Power Generation Plant during operation is 
considered to be minimal and will be both non-hazardous and 
hazardous in nature. The wastes produced during the operational 
phase include used air filters, scrap metal, used insulation material, 
general office waste, and other miscellaneous wastes. Small quantities 
of water (blowdown) will be discharged to avoid the build-up of 
impurities in the HRSG steam/water cycle.   
Gas and Electrical Connection 
5.9.4 
For the Gas and Electrical Connections, waste is only anticipated 
during the construction and decommissioning phases.  
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.9.5 
Currently the Power Generation Plant site is occupied by industrial 
buildings and hardstanding.   The possible route of the Electrical 
Connection will be under scrub/waterlogged grassland and the Gas 
Connection through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and along roads / 
across agricultural fields.   
5.9.6 
The main works associated with the development of the Power 
Generation Plant will be the demolition of existing buildings, levelling of 
the site, covering in hardstanding and the installation of modest 
foundations.  
5.9.7 
These activities will involve the generation of waste, some of which  will 
need to be safely removed from site.  Some of this waste may include 
asbestos (from existing buildings).  
Gas Connection 
5.9.8 
The laying of the Gas Connection will primarily involve the excavation 
of a trench and backfilling with spoil (although drilling techniques will be 
used if the route crosses under watercourses / roads or railways. 
5.9.9 
These activities will involve the generation of waste, some of which  will 
need to be safely removed from site.   
Electrical Connection

5.9.10 
The laying of the underground Electrical Connection will primarily 
involve the excavation of a trench and backfilling with spoil (although 
drilling techniques may be used where the route crosses under roads 
or watercourses).  
5.9.11 
If an overhead line is installed, the amount of earthworks would be 
reduced, although significant excavations would be required for the 
installation of foundations to support the overhead line towers.  
5.9.12 
These activities will involve the generation of waste, some of which will 
need to be safely removed from site.  
Assessment (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection)  
5.9.13 
The waste management assessment will involve a DBA including the 
following elements: 
� 
Identification of relevant legislation, sources of information and 
local strategies and plans; 
� 
Consideration of solid waste arising during the construction, 
operational and decommissioning phase of the power station; and  
� 
Demonstrating compliance with the waste hierarchy (e.g. reduce, 
reuse, recycling, recovery and/or disposal) when managing all 
wastes. 
5.9.14 
The assessment of the impacts will include: 
� 
Consideration of any relevant consultee responses / requirement; 
� 
An estimation of the likely construction and operational waste 
arisings; 
� 
An assessment of the potential impact of the estimated 
construction and operational waste arisings in the context of 
baseline conditions and local infrastructure capacity; 
� 
Identification and consideration of any best practice measures (to 
minimise or eliminate waste and the adverse effects caused by 
waste) that will be adopted as mitigation. Also looking at where 
reprocessed materials could be used on site; 
� 
An assessment of the significance of projected waste arisings 
following mitigation.  Demonstrating how mitigation will reduce the 
impacts/effects of the waste arisings; 
� 
An assessment of the cumulative impacts with other proposed and 
operational schemes.

Potential Mitigation Measures (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection)  
5.9.15 
The main embedded mitigation measure which will be employed during 
the construction, operational and decommissioning phases will be to 
minimise the production of waste where practical.  Wherever possible, 
waste materials will be re-used or re-cycled, this will be achieved partly 
through the SWMP.  
5.9.16 
Further, specific mitigation measures, if necessary, will be determined 
through the EIA.  
5.10 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
Introduction (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection) 
5.10.1 
The main impacts of the HPP on traffic, transport and access will occur 
during construction.  The construction traffic is expected to consist 
mainly of vehicles for the transport of construction personnel to and 
from the site.  The construction period (as stated in Section 3.3 of this 
Report) is likely to be between 12 and 36 months depending on the 
final choice of technology.  
5.10.2 
There will also be a number of other transport movements during 
construction including civil works traffic, mechanical works traffic and 
heavy/abnormal loads.  Total vehicles (heavy goods vehicles, light 
goods vehicles, cars) peak movements will vary depending on the 
phase of construction and the activities which are being undertaken on 
site.   
5.10.3 
The transport of abnormal loads, which may lead to delays and cause 
inconvenience to other road users, would be timed following 
consultation with the relevant authorities to minimise disruption to the 
other road users.   
5.10.4 
Normal operation will naturally result in fewer traffic movements than 
those associated with construction and will be associated with 
personnel required for operation and maintenance of the plant.  As 
such, during operation no significant increase in traffic in the area of the 
site is expected, and no effect on local traffic patterns and infrastructure 
would therefore be anticipated. 
Baseline (Power Generation Plant and Electrical Connection) 
5.10.5 
It is likely that access to the site for construction and operation of the 
Power Generation Plant and Electrical Connection would be via the M4,

accessed from junction 43 via the A465, A4061 (Rhigos Road), Fifth 
Avenue and Main Avenue.  
Gas Connection  
5.10.6 
For the Gas Connection, access may also be required from the A4061 
(Rhigos Road).  
Assessment (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection) 
5.10.7 
NPS EN 1 states that in relation to transport impacts, following full 
assessment, the need for travel plans or other demand management or 
other mitigation should be considered particularly for the construction 
phase (5.13.6), and the decision maker should consider the feasibility 
and cost effectiveness of such measures (paragraph 5.13.8, EN-1). 
5.10.8 
The assessment will be undertaken in accordance with the “Guidance 
on Transport Assessment” published by the Department for Transport 
and will gauge the likely impact of the proposed HPP on the local road 
network.   
5.10.9 
Comparisons between existing traffic flows and estimates of likely 
future traffic flows on potentially affected roads will be made.  It will 
then be established whether significant effects are likely.  This will take 
into account: the sensitivity of receptors; the resources likely to be 
affected; any potential for disruption to local routes; and, any changes 
in the composition of traffic.  If considered necessary, traffic surveys 
would be undertaken which would further quantify the number of 
vehicle movements on the existing road network in the vicinity of the 
site.  
5.10.10 
The majority of the proposed access routes are ‘main roads’ that do not 
have pavements for pedestrian use. Nonetheless, the traffic 
assessment will also take full account of the potential impact on 
pedestrians, and will ensure that pedestrians and other road users 
(cyclists) are not cut off from amenity areas as a result of the works.  
5.10.11 
The proposed assessment requires consideration of the following: 
access and construction routes and the types of vehicles used; local 
highway and rail networks; existing traffic flows; current traffic 
generation; road traffic accident information; predicted traffic trends; 
local highway improvements and planned works; and, potential 
receptors. The full appraisal would be presented in a Transport 
Assessment which would be accompanied with a Construction Traffic 
Management Plan.

5.10.12 
Discussions will be held with the Highways Agency and RCT to identify 
any existing issues relating to traffic in the area and to scope the extent 
and detail required for the Transport Assessment.  Information will also 
be sought on future projects in the area which could give rise to a 
significant cumulative impact when considered in conjunction with the 
Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections. 
5.10.13 
The A465 dualling scheme is part of the National Transport Plan and 
will improve the length between Abergavenny and Hirwaun to dual 2-
lane standard by 2020. The improved road will upgrade links to 
businesses and communities, ease traffic congestion and improve 
safety. The scheme comprises widening of some 40km of the existing 
A465 between the Hardwick Roundabout at Abergavenny and the 
existing roundabout to the west of Hirwaun. 
5.10.14 
For construction, the road development project has been divided into 
six sections. The A465 / A470 Junction to Hirwaun is the last of the six 
sections to be completed for the scheme and as such, the section does 
not yet have a programme date but will be commenced in time for 
completion by 2020.  
Potential Mitigation Measures (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
5.10.15 
The main potential impacts on traffic movements are likely to be 
associated with the construction phase of the HPP.  During 
construction, opportunities for reducing traffic movements will be 
explored, such as car share schemes, shift working (i.e. not all 
construction traffic arriving at site at once) or the use of minibuses 
through the production of a Travel Plan for the construction and 
operational phases of the Project. 
5.11 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology 
Introduction 
Power Generation Plant  
5.11.1 
This Section of the ES will provide an assessment of the significance of 
the archaeological and cultural heritage assets of the Power 
Generation Plant site and its immediate environs, and the potential 
impact that the development may have on these resources.   
Gas and Electrical Connection 
5.11.2 
Separate Sections of the ES will be produced which describe the likely 
significant effects that the Gas and Electrical Connections may have on

the archaeological resource present along the connection route 
corridors.  
5.11.3 
The objectives of these assessments are to: 
� 
Describe the survival and extent of any archaeological features 
which may be disturbed by the proposed development;  
� 
Provide an assessment of the importance of these assets;  
� 
Assess the likely scale of any impacts on the archaeological and 
cultural heritage resource posed by the development;  
� 
Outline suitable mitigation measures to avoid, reduce or remedy 
significant adverse effects; and 
� 
Provide an assessment of any residual effects remaining after 
mitigation.  
Baseline 
Power Generation Plant  
5.11.4 
The site of the proposed Power Generation Plant is an industrial estate 
and is currently occupied by a mixture of modern industrial buildings 
and hardstanding, although there are also small areas of scrub, 
grassland and woodland.  The main works associated with the 
development of the Power Generation Plant will be the demolition of 
existing buildings, levelling of the site, covering in hardstanding and the 
installation of foundations.  
5.11.5 
A search of the Historic Wales online database
5 has revealed that the 
only Scheduled Ancient Monument in the vicinity of the Power 
Generation Plant site is the remains of Hirwaun Iron Works.   
5.11.6 
There are very few listed buildings with 2km of the Power Generation 
Plant site.  These include: 
� 
Colliery Buildings at the former Tower Colliery, Rhigos – 
approximately 1.5km south; 
� 
War Memorial and Clock Tower, Tramroad Causeway and Bridge 
and Nebo Independent Chapel, Hirwaun – approximately 2km east; 
and  
� 
Old house, with attached byre and barn at Trebanog Fach – 
approximately 1km north.

5.11.7 
All of these buildings are Grade 2 listed.  
5.11.8 
In the wider vicinity of the Power Generation Plant site, there are larger 
clusters of listed buildings in: 
� 
Pentreclwydau – 2.5km west; 
� 
Aberdare – 5km east; and  
� 
Penderyn – 3km north.  
5.11.9 
There are likely to be some large structures associated with the 
development of the Power Generation Plant which may be visible from 
these listed buildings.  However, the development of the Power 
Generation Plant would not alter the already industrial make up of the 
site and surrounding area, and it is not anticipated that the project 
would impact on the immediate setting or appreciation of these 
buildings.  
5.11.10 
One entry on the National Monuments Record of Wales is recorded 
approximately 50m to the north of the Power Generation Plant, which 
relates to the former Hirwaun Royal Armaments Factory.  
5.11.11 
The National Monuments Record of Wales records a few isolated 
remains within the immediate vicinity of the site, including a Bronze Age 
Cairnfield approximately 200m to the north west, and a post-medieval 
colliery approximately 200m to the south west of the site.  
5.11.12 
During construction, the main potential impacts on any archaeological 
and cultural heritage assets, will be the potential disturbance of buried 
archaeological remains, both known and unknown.   
5.11.13 
Given the current site use, the Power Generation Plant is not 
anticipated to have any significant impacts on buried archaeology as 
previous development of the site is likely to have removed or destroyed 
any archaeological remains.  Although it is considered unlikely that 
significant archaeological remains will be present on site, the presence 
of previously unknown archaeological sites should not be ruled out due 
to the possible shallow nature of previous ground disturbance, and 
areas of undisturbed ground.  
5.11.14 
There are likely to be large items of plant involved in the construction of 
the Power Generation Plant (e.g. cranes). However, these would be 
temporary structures, and given the distance from sensitive receptors 
(e.g. listed buildings) they are not anticipated to impact on the setting of 
these assets.  
5.11.15 
The main potential impacts during operation are those on the setting of 
above ground assets resulting from the Power Generation Plant.

Gas Connection  
5.11.16 
Connection through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and along roads / 
across agricultural fields. 
5.11.17 
There remains the potential for the Gas Connection to impact on the 
buried archaeological resource, as it is likely that it will be constructed 
in previously un-developed agricultural land.  
Electrical Connection 
5.11.18 
The possible routes of the Electrical Connection are to the west of the 
site either alongside roads or over scrub/waterlogged grassland areas.  
5.11.19 
The main potential impacts arising from the electrical connection would 
be on the setting of upstanding heritage assets (e.g. listed buildings) 
should an overhead line be considered as the preferred connection 
option.  
5.11.20 
Given the close proximity of the electrical connection to the Power 
Generation Plant site, those assets listed above as potentially impacted 
by the Power Generation Plant may also be impacted by an overhead 
line.  
Assessment  
Power Generation Plant  
5.11.21 
NPS EN 1 states that in relation to the setting of heritage assets, the 
decision maker ‘should treat favourably applications that preserve 
those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to, or 
better reveal the significance of, the asset. When considering 
applications that do not do this, the IPC [decision maker] should weigh 
any negative effects against the wider benefits of the application’ 
(paragraph 5.8.18, EN-1).  
5.11.22 
Initially, a DBA will be undertaken, and will include the following 
detailed searches:  
� 
The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments 
Wales is the investigative body and national archive for the historic 
environment of Wales and hosts an online search facility (Coflein); 
� 
Glamorgan and Gwent Archaeological Trust (GGAT) Historic 
Environment Record (HER) (which includes  records of any 
previous archaeological interventions within the Scheme Area).  
The HER will also include details of Registered Parks and Gardens, 
Listed Buildings and Registered Battlefields;

� 
Aberdare Local Reference Library;  
�

� 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation.   
5.11.23 
The DBA will be undertaken in accordance with ‘Standard and 
Guidance 
for 
Archaeological 
Assessments’ 
(Institute 
for 
Archaeologists, 2011).   
5.11.24 
It is proposed that initially, searches are limited to 1km for HER entries.  
5.11.25 
As part of the DBA, an inspection of the Power Generation Plant site 
would be undertaken to identify any previously unknown archaeological 
features and their condition.  During the site inspection a detailed 
photographic record would be maintained.  
5.11.26 
At this stage, no intrusive investigations are proposed for cultural 
heritage or archaeological purposes, although this will be confirmed (or 
otherwise) based on the findings of the DBA, and in consultation with 
the GGAT Planning Archaeologist and representative of CADW.  
Should intrusive investigations be necessary, their scope would be 
agreed with the Planning Archaeologist through a Written Scheme of 
Investigation (WSI).  
5.11.27 
In order to gather baseline setting data, and to undertake an 
assessment of the potential impacts which the development may have 
on the setting of any above ground remains, selected heritage assets 
will be visited.  This will follow an initial study making reference to the 
results of desk-based research, and the ZTV including searches of the 
records listed above.  Assets will be visited where this initial study 
indicated potential for significant impacts.  Both the asset and its 
surrounding area will be visited to identify third locations that might be 
relevant to the asset’s setting. 
5.11.28 
For the purposes of the setting study, the following assets will be 
considered: 
� 
Scheduled Monuments; 
� 
Listed Buildings; 
� 
Registered Parks and Gardens; 
� 
Registered Battlefields; 
� 
World Heritage Sites;

� 
Any other non-scheduled building which is considered to be 
important in terms of cultural heritage and archaeological 
significance.  
5.11.29 
It is proposed that the search area for these assets will be limited to 
5km from the centre of the proposed Power Generation Plant, as, 
based on experience of similar developments, significant impacts on 
setting are unlikely to occur beyond 5km.  However, should significant 
impacts be identified, then the search area would be expanded 
accordingly.  
5.11.30 
NPS EN-1 states in relation to the setting of heritage assets that the 
decision maker ‘should treat favourably applications that preserve 
those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to, or 
better reveal the significance of, the asset. When considering 
applications that do not do this, the IPC [decision maker] should weigh 
any negative effects against the wider benefits of the application’ 
(paragraph 5.8.18, EN-1). 
5.11.31 
The setting studies will reference Welsh Office Circular 61/96, which 
sets out guidance for Historic Buildings and Conservation Areas
6.  
5.11.32 
Circular 61/96 states that “Setting is often an essential part of a 
buildings character.....Also, the character of listed buildings may suffer 
and they may be robbed of much of their interest and the contribution 
they make to townscape or countryside if they become isolated from 
their surroundings” (paragraph 11).  
5.11.33 
There is no Specific TAN detailing planning guidance for archaeology 
and cultural heritage.  However, TAN 12 ‘Design’ sets out principles 
which should be followed in the design of a new development.  
Paragraph 5.6.2 states that in considering the design of a new 
development, a key aspect is likely to be the setting and views of key 
buildings, landscape, parks and gardens, archaeology and skylines 
within, to and from the [development] area.  
5.11.34 
The following factors are also considered to be relevant when 
assessing impacts upon setting (Taken from English Heritage (2011 
and CADW ‘Conservation Principles for the Sustainable Management 
of the Historic Environment in Wales’).  
� 
Visual Dominance;  
� 
Scale;  
�

The DBA will form the baseline data for the Cultural Heritage and 
Archaeology Section of the ES.  The ES Section will discuss the nature 
and location of all cultural heritage and archaeological sites within the 
Scheme Area.  Further to this, the ES will provide an assessment of the 
significance of any impacts to the cultural heritage and archaeology 
sites.  Where necessary, recommendations will be made for a 
mitigation strategy to preserve in-situ any significant archaeological 
assets.  The ES will also include a mitigation strategy for any significant 
impacts to listed buildings and other above – ground assets.  
Gas and Electrical Connections 
5.11.36 
It is proposed that the same assessment methodology is used for 
assessing potential impacts of the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
Potential Mitigation Measures (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
5.11.37 
Prior to construction, the nature and extent of known/recorded 
archaeology present at the site and surrounding areas will have been 
established.  However, should any unrecorded archaeological remains 
be found during construction, work will be halted and advice sought 
from the RCT archaeologist.  
5.11.38 
During operation, further mitigation measures could include the 
opportunity to provide screen planting, should the development give 
rise to any adverse impacts on above ground heritage assets.  
5.12 
Socio-economics 
Introduction (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection) 
5.12.1 
At its peak, the construction workforce is expected to employ between 
150 and 250  personnel.  Whilst subject to procurement rules, it is 
anticipated that as much as possible of this workforce will be recruited 
locally.   
5.12.2 
Operation of the Power Generation Plant would require a maximum of 
up to 30 full time staff (for CCGT operation) although for other 
technology choices this number would be of the order of 10 to 15.  
There would be further indirect jobs for contracted engineering staff

during regular maintenance shutdowns and regular maintenance of the 
Gas and Electrical Connections.   
5.12.3 
A recent Report by Ernst and Young entitled “Powering the UK – 
Investing for the future of the Energy Sector and the UK” has estimated 
that direct employment in the energy sector “......grew from 83,000 to 
137,000 between 2008 and 2011, with growth of 6% between 2010 and 
2011. The indirect employment benefit is over three times the direct 
benefit bringing the total number of jobs supported by the sector to 
around 655,000”. 
5.12.4 
Local companies will likely provide further unskilled and semi-skilled 
services to the development during operations and it is anticipated 
that new jobs may be created on the basis of the levels of permanent 
staff in these local service industries.  There would also be periodic 
requirements for ground maintenance, ad hoc plant maintenance and 
annual plant maintenance creating additional economic activity.  
5.12.5 
The total capital cost of the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to be 
of the order of £200million.  Up to approximately 35% of this will be 
construction, civils and fabrication work which would be open to tender 
from Welsh companies (if CCGT technology is chosen). 
5.12.6 
During construction, those workers from outside the local area would 
require places to stay, and regular sustenance, therefore having knock 
on benefits to local businesses and services.  
5.12.7 
In addition, the HPP would also represent an additional income source 
to the local economy during the operational phase in terms of local

HPL will investigate, with key stakeholders, a method for providing 
benefits to the local community beyond the direct creation of jobs.  
Baseline (Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection) 
5.12.9 
The area surrounding the site has a long history of both mining and 
agriculture.  Historically, the Hirwaun Industrial Estate housed a large 
Armaments Factory as well as a metal recycling facility, construction 
plant supplier and large supply and distribution warehouse.

Rhondda Cynon Taf is the second largest Local Authority in Wales, 
formed in 1996 from the former Boroughs of Rhondda, Cynon Valley 
and Taff Ely (part). The County Borough covers an area of 424 square 
kilometres with a population of 231,946 (2001). The area has 75 
electoral wards, of which 22 are Communities First Areas.  Strategic

highway links with the wider region are provided by the M4, A470 and 
A465. 
5.12.11 
The resident population of Rhondda Cynon Taf mid-2007 is 233,734 
persons. This population is projected to increase by 20,900 or 9% by 
mid-2030 (Office for National Statistics). 
5.12.12 
73% of residents in Rhondda Cynon Taf are economically active 
compared with a Welsh average of 75% (Employment Land Review, 
2008).  
5.12.13 
The central and northern valleys have above average levels of people 
claiming Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) in Wales and the highest level 
of claimants in Rhondda Cynon Taf at 3.1% (Employment Land 
Review, 2008). 
5.12.14 
The employment structure of Rhondda Cynon Taf is dominated by 
three sectors ‘public administration’, ‘manufacturing’ and ‘distribution, 
hotels and restaurants’. Together, these three account for 74% of all 
available jobs in Rhondda Cynon Taf (Employment Land Review, 
2008). 
5.12.15 
The aim of the Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan is to 
create a land use framework which will:  
� 
Build sustainable communities that ensure everyone has access to 
housing, jobs and essential services and that all new development 
is supported by necessary social and physical infrastructure.  This 
will be achieved by focussing new growth in principal towns and 
key settlements; 
� 
Ensure that Rhondda Cynon Taf achieves its potential by 
maximizing the advantages of its strategic location, both in terms of 
the Capital Region and global economy.  It will also maximise 
opportunities for inward investment in Hirwaun and Llantrisant / 
Talbot Green; 
� 
Deliver a better quality of life by ensuring our communities are 
vibrant, healthy and safe, provide access to a range of cultural, 
commercial and leisure activities and protect our natural heritage 
and built environment; 
� 
Develop and protect the County Borough for future generations so 
that physical and natural resources are protected, the challenges of 
climate change are met and new development is in sustainable 
locations and of the highest environmental standards.

5.12.16 
NPS EN-1 states that In relation to socio-economic impacts ‘the 
assessment should consider all relevant socio-economic impacts’ 
(paragraph 5.12.3, EN-1) such as tourism, influxes of workers, and 
cumulative effects.  
5.12.17 
There is currently no established EIA methodology for the assessment 
of socio-economic impacts.  To assess the socio-economic impacts the 
“Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment” (May 1994) 
produced by the Interorganizational Committee on Guidelines and 
Principles for Social Impact Assessment will be used. 
5.12.18 
The socio-economic impact of the HPP will be addressed for the 
construction, operational and decommissioning phases.  The socio-
economic make-up of the area surrounding the Comprehensive 
Development will be described and the likely impacts on this baseline 
will be assessed.   
5.12.19 
The study area will extend to cover the immediate area of Rhondda 
Cynon Taf and the wider area of South Wales in general, in order to 
assess the likely effects that may be experienced within the local 
community.   
5.12.20 
The methodology for the socio-economic impact assessment will be 
based on the collection of a wide range of data and information from 
published materials, plus consultation with the local authority and key 
stakeholders.  Key information to be consulted will include: 
� 
Population characteristics (population dynamics); 
� 
Community and institutional structures (employment, training, skills 
and qualifications, economic investment, business development 
and equal opportunities); 
� 
Individual and family changes (perceptions of risk, attitudes 
towards the project, social well-being); and 
� 
Community resources (security, access to local amenities including 
Public Rights of Way (PRoWs)). 
Potential Project Enhancements 
5.12.21 
During construction, operation and decommissioning, an effort will be 
made to use local goods and services, wherever possible.  
5.13 
Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)  
5.13.1 
The potential effects of EMF will only be considered should the decision 
be taken to use an overhead line to export electricity from the Power 
Generation Plant to the National Grid.

5.13.2 
EMF are generated when a current is passed through a conductor.  For 
most purposes EMFs can be considered as an electric field and a 
magnetic field although the two are not completely separable.  These 
fields consist of lines of force that affect charged objects in their vicinity.  
EMFs occur naturally in the human body from nerve and muscle activity 
and are present, at background levels, at all times in the wider 
environment.  This background level can vary greatly depending upon 
factors such as atmospheric conditions. 
5.13.3 
All overhead power lines produce EMFs, and these tend to be highest 
directly under a line, and decrease to the sides at increasing distance. 
5.13.4 
The forces generated by external EMFs can have effects on the human 
body, but at significantly higher levels than the average exposure.  It is 
possible for EMFs to induce currents in the body and can lead to a 
spark discharge when a person comes into contact with a grounded 
object.  
5.13.5 
There is an increasing public concern regarding the possible adverse 
health effects associated with electromagnetic fields generated by 
power transmission lines.  Various studies have been conducted 
around the world investigating the link between exposure to power 
frequency EMFs and serious illnesses.   
5.13.6 
Most of the evidence that indicates a direct causal link to EMFs is 
statistical in nature and the correlations are small.  There are concerns 
regarding the lack of reproducible results from these studies and there 
is no known, or theoretical, biological mechanism for the triggering of 
these illnesses with power frequency EMFs.  
5.13.7 
Electrical equipment operating within an electromagnetic field can also 
be affected.  The magnetic forces can cause interference with visual 
display units (VDU) resulting in image vibration.  The magnitude is 
dependant upon the difference between the refresh rate of the screen 
and the frequency of the field, and the strength of the field.   
5.13.8 
The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) were given a remit 
from the UK Government to provide advice on EMFs and safe 
exposure thresholds.  In 1993 they published guidelines designed to 
limit the induced current effect of electromagnetic fields on the human 
body.  These comprised of: a basic restriction of current density, being 
the maximum induced current that the central nervous system should 
be exposed to, and reference levels for the strength of the electric and 
magnetic fields that were not suggested as limits but as guides for 
investigating the basic restriction.

5.13.9 
No mitigation measures are deemed to be necessary as the exposure 
levels generated by the transmission line are below the values cited in 
all professional advice given on electromagnetic fields and the 
thresholds set within the EU Directive. 
5.13.10 
The Section will also pay due regard to NPS EN-5, which sets out 
technology-specific considerations for the impact of EMFs, which is not 
an impact considered in EN-1.  
5.13.11 
Section 2.10 of NPS EN-5 states that ‘To prevent these known effects, 
the International Commission on Non- Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP21) developed health protection guidelines in 1998 for both 
public and occupational exposure. These are expressed in terms of the 
induced current density in affected tissues of the body, “basic 
restrictions”, and in terms of measurable “reference levels” of electric 
field strength (for electric fields), and magnetic flux density (for 
magnetic fields). The relationship between the (measurable) electric 
field strength or magnetic flux density and induced current density in 
body tissues requires complex dosimetric modelling. The reference 
levels are such that compliance with them will ensure that the basic 
restrictions are not reached or exceeded. However, exceeding the 
reference levels does not necessarily mean that the basic restrictions 
will not be met; this would be a trigger for further investigation into the 
specific circumstances. For protecting against indirect effects, the 
ICNIRP 1998 guidelines give an electric field reference of 5kV m-1 for 
the general public, and keeping electric fields below this level would 
reduce the occurrence of adverse indirect effects for most individuals to 
acceptable levels. When this level is exceeded, there is a suite of 
measures that may be called upon in particular situations, including 
provision of information, earthing and screening, alongside limiting the 
field. In some situations there may be no reasonable way of eliminating 
indirect effects’. 
5.14 
Cumulative Assessment  
5.14.1 
In line with the EIA Regulations, the EIA will take into account other 
existing and planned developments (currently within the planning 
system) in the area of the proposed Power Generation Plant site and 
connection corridors, and will consider the cumulative impacts 
associated with these developments in conjunction with the HPP. 
5.14.2 
The EIA for the Power Generation Plant will consider the cumulative 
impacts of the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical Connections, noting that 
the Gas and Electrical Connections may or may not be consented 
under the Planning Act 2008 regime.

Executive Summary
Purpose of this Report
This report has been produced for the purpose of providing an ecological desk study and Extended Phase 1 
Habitat survey of a section of Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site (located at NGR SN38061), to inform proposals 
to develop the site and identify any ecological constraints present across the site. It is understood that the site 
is being reviewed for the proposed location of a new gas fired power generation plant with associated 
pipeline and electricity cables infrastructure. Maps provided by Watt Power Limited were used to obtain 
background site and project information. This ecological assessment has therefore been based upon the 
assumption that any proposed works will be restricted to the site perimeter as provided, and indicated on 
Figure 1, with no disturbance to surrounding areas other than that required for access. 
The main ecological value of the site lies in the potential use of the site by bats in particular the roosting 
opportunities presented by a number of the buildings, as well as the potential for bats and badgers to be using 
the woodland habitat. The botanical interest of the unimproved grassland area is also of ecological value, 
including the potential to support a diversity of invertebrate species and potential larval food plants for 
invertebrates of potential significance.  The habitats present on site may also present opportunities for use by 
great crested newts, breeding birds and to a lesser extent, common reptiles. 
It is recommended that the following surveys are undertaken to gain more detailed ecological information on 
the use of the site by protected flora and fauna:
Further bat scoping survey of the buildings identified on site; inspection of potential access points 
using an endoscope, along with dusk and dawn emergence/re-entry surveys will determine the 
presence/likely absence of roosting bats at these sites. Robust dusk/dawn bat surveys can be 
undertaken from approximately April to September, depending on weather conditions;
If the proposed development works are likely to encroach into fringing woodland areas it is 
recommended that further surveys are undertaken to assess the use of the woodland by bats and 
identify any suitable trees which may provide roosting habitat for bats;
Further badger survey of the woodland areas in the south of the site and bordering the north of the 
site;
Botanical survey of the site to establish presence/absence of any protected or notable plants or 
potential larval food plants for invertebrates of potential significance; 
Invertebrate survey to establish presence/absence of any protected or notable invertebrate species;
and
Further assessment and great crested newt survey of the ponds identified as lying on/just beyond 
the site boundary and those lying within 500m.

32820 Final Report 12311i1
Whilst the assessment was limited to the area shown (etched yellow) on Figure 1 it is understood that the 
proposed development may include the installation of pipelines and cables off site. In view of this and given 
the close proximity of the study site to a number of European Protected Sites, it is possible that a Habitat 
Regulations Assessment may be required.
The above recommendations are based on the development details available to date. Once further details are 
made available further detailed surveys may be required and it is recommended that CCW and the local 
County Ecologist are consulted to confirm the scope and extent of required surveys and assessments.

Introduction
1.1
Terms of Reference
AMEC Environment and Infrastructure UK Ltd were commissioned by Watt Power Limited in July 2012 
to undertake an ecological desk study and extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey of a site within Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate (grid ref: SN938061), located in the borough of Rhondda Cynan Taff in South east 
Wales. The survey was required to assess the potential for protected species and/or their habitats to be 
present at the site. 
It is understood that the site is being reviewed for the proposed location of a new gas fired power 
generating plant and will require associated gas pipeline and electrical cable infrastructure (offsite 
elements are not considered within this assessment).
This report encompasses our findings and recommendations for further ecological input where necessary.
1.2
Objectives
The objectives of the study were to:
assess the general ecological value of the site and identify features of particular ecological interest;
assess the potential of the site to support protected species; and outline the potential impacts from
any future works; and
identify potential ecological constraints to the scope of works and outline recommendations in 
relation to appropriate mitigation measures or further specialist surveys as appropriate.
To achieve these objectives a desk-based study and an ecological scoping survey were undertaken.

Legislation and Planning Policy Context
2.1
National Planning Policy and Legislation
Guidance on nature conservation planning policy is provided in the National Assembly for Wales 
Planning Division Technical Advice Note 5 (TAN 5 Nature Conservation and Planning (2009). This is 
concerned both with the protection of statutorily designated sites and habitats, the conservation of 
protected and priority species and protecting and enhancing biodiversity and nature conservation in the 
wider countryside.
TAN 5 paragraph. 1.6.1 states:
“Biodiversity conservation and enhancement is an integral part of planning for sustainable development. 
The planning system has an important part to play in nature conservation. The use and development of 
land can pose threats to the conservation of natural features and wildlife. Past changes have contributed to 
the loss of integrity of habitat networks through land-take, fragmentation, severance, disturbance, 
hydrological changes and other adverse impacts. But development can also present significant 
opportunities to enhance wildlife habitats and the enjoyment and understanding of the natural heritage”. 
TAN 5 paragraph. 3.2.2 states:
“Statutory sites and non-statutory sites, together with features which provide wildlife corridors, links or 
stepping stones from one habitat to another, all contribute to the network necessary to ensure the 
maintenance of the current range and diversity of our flora, fauna, geological and landform features and 
the survival of important species. Sensitive landscaping and planting, the creation, maintenance and 
management of landscape features important to wildlife, and the skilled adaptation of derelict areas can 
provide extended habitats”.
These paragraphs recognise the vital role of the planning system in nature conservation and that careful 
planning can be used to reconcile nature conservation and development.
Planning Policy Wales (March 2002), to which local authorities must have regard when preparing Unitary 
Development Plans, sets out policies for the conservation of biodiversity. Planning Policy Wales 
identifies protected species as “a material consideration when a local planning authority is considering a 
development proposal which, if carried out, would be likely to result in disturbance or harm to the species 
or its habitat.”
National legislation for the special protection of selected species is provided in the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981, as amended. 
Under Section 1(1) and 1(2), all British bird species, their nests and eggs (excluding some pest and game 
species) are protected from intentional killing, injury or damage. Under Sections 1(4) and 1(5), special 
3

32820 Final Report 12311i1
penalties are applied to bird species included in Schedule 1 of the Act and protection is extended for these 
species to disturbance to birds whilst building, in or near a nest and disturbance to dependant young. 
Schedule 5 provides special protection to selected animal species other than birds, such as great crested 
newts through paragraph 9(4) of the Act, against damage to “any structure or place which any wild 
animal (included in the schedule) uses for shelter and protection” and against disturbance whilst in such 
places. The CRoW Act 2000 amends Section 1(5) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 by 
introducing a new offence of “reckless” disturbance to protected wildlife and making certain offences 
punishable by imprisonment.
The great crested newt, along with a number of other animal species such as otter are provided additional 
protection through inclusion on Schedule 2 of The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 
2010 (which consolidates all amendments to, and replaces, the Conservation of Natural Habitats, &c.) 
Regulations 1994, as amended). These transpose into British law the European Community’s Habitats 
Directive (92/43/EEC).  The Regulations, commonly referred to as the “Habitats Regulations”, extend 
protection against deliberate disturbance to those animals wherever they are present, and provides tests 
against which the permission for a development that may have an effect on a Schedule 2 protected species 
must be assessed before permission can be given. 
Each of the 6 native reptile species of Britain receive some level of protection under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) as amended.  Under section 9 (parts 1 & 5), schedule 5 of this act all 
species are protected from being intentionally killed, injured or taken or from being traded. The four most 
commonly occurring species are adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, slow-worm Anguis 
fragilis and common lizard Zootoca vivipara and these species are protected against killing and injury
The marsh fritillary butterfly Eurodryas aurinia is listed on Annex II of the EC Habitats Directive and 
Appendix  II  of  the  Bern  Convention.  It  is  also  fully  protected  under  Section  9  of  the  Wildlife  and  
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and is listed as a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan 
(BAP).
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 provides protection to badgers and their setts.
Bats are offered special protection under The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) Schedule 
5, Section 9. This Act transposes into UK law the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife 
and Natural Habitats (commonly referred to as the “Bern Convention”. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 
was amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way [CroW] Act 2000. This makes it is an offence to:
Intentionally kill, injure or take any species of bat [Section 9(1)];
Possess or control any live or dead specimens or anything derived from a bat [Section 9(2)];
Intentionally or recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to any structure or place used for 
shelter or protection by a bat [Section 9(4)(a)]; and
4
© AMEC Environment & Infrastructure UK Limited
32820 Final Report 12311i1
Intentionally or recklessly disturb a bat while it is occupying a place or structure which it uses for 
that purpose [Section 9(4)(b)].
Bats receive additional protection under The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
(formerly  the  Conservation  (Natural  Habitats  &c)  Regulations  1994),  which  transposes  into  UK  law  
Council Directive 92/43/eec on the Conservation of Natural Habitats of Wild Fauna and Flora (referred to 
as the Habitats [and Species] Directive). Bats are listed on Annex II and Annex IV of the Directive. 
Inclusion in Annex II serves to underline their (the bats’) conservation significance; inclusion in Annex 
IV (European Protected Species) means that member states are required to put into place a system of strict 
protection as outlined in Article 12. This makes it an offence to:
Deliberately capture or kill a bat;
Deliberately disturb a bat; and
Deliberately damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a bat.
There are several exceptions to the provisions listed above. Licenses permit unlawful activities and are 
granted for certain purposes by Natural England for scientific, education and/or conservation purposes 
(including survey). Natural England issue licences for the purposes of “preserving public health or safety 
or other imperative reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature 
and beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment”.
2.2
Biodiversity Action Plans
Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) are part of the UK government’s strategy for the implementation of the 
1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, to which it is a signatory. BAPs have been developed for the 
UK and devolved to local levels (LBAPs), to protect a number of rare species and habitats and reverse the 
declines of more widespread, but declining, species and habitats. Under the CRoW Act 2000, the UK 
Government has a duty to have due regard to the purpose of conserving biodiversity, so it is good practice 
for  BAP  and  LBAP  species  and  habitats  to  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  planning  of  a  works  
schedule.
In addition to the overall UK BAP, the site is covered by the Local BAP (LBAP), in this case this is the 
Rhondda Cynan Taf LBAP.
Appendix A details the habitats and species listed within the Rhondda Cynan Taf LBAP.

Methodology
3.1
Desk-based Assessment
Upon commissioning, a consultation and data collation exercise was undertaken to check for records of 
protected species, statutory designated sites and important habitat features within and surrounding the 
study site (to a radius of 2km). The following organisations and websites were consulted:
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBRC) 
Countryside Council for Wales’ interactive mapping service http://www.ccw.gov.uk/interactive-
maps/protected-sites-map.aspx
Rhondda Cynan Taf County Borough Council Ecologist – Richard Wistow
Ordnance Survey and satellite mapping service - http://wtp2.appspot.com/wheresthepath.htm
3.2
Ecological Scoping Survey
An initial daytime visit was made to the site on July 10th
This  level  of  survey  is  not  a  full  protected  species  or  botanical  survey,  but  instead  is  a  tool  for  
determining the requirement for more detailed protected species surveys on the basis of field signs and 
habitat quality. This method of survey enables professional ecologists to obtain an understanding of the 
ecology of a site such that either:
2012 by two suitably experienced ecologists, to 
carry out an extended Phase I Habitat Survey. The aim of this was to record the habitats and features of 
the site (Figure 1 Phase I Habitat Map), evaluate the ecological interest of these features and the likely 
impacts of any re-development works on protected habitats or species. Although the extent of any 
proposed works are as yet unknown, the survey covered all built structures and landscaping within the site 
perimeter indicated on the maps provided, and as shown in Figure 1. It does not cover the extent of 
proposals for any off-site infrastructure.
the conservation significance of the site can be confirmed and the potential for impacts on 
habitats/species likely to represent a material consideration prior to and during works can be assessed; 
or,
it can be ascertained that further surveys of certain aspects of the site’s ecology will be required before 
such confirmation can be made.

Desk-based Assessment
Statutory Designated Sites
The proposed development site does not lie within a statutory designated site. Interrogation of the 
interactive mapping service provided by Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) found there to be six
Statutory Designated Sites for nature conservation within a 2km radius of the study site, the closest being 
the Brecon Beacons National Park which lies approximately 0.3km to the north of the site and covers and 
area of 134,954 ha.
Woodland Park and Pontpren Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
Woodland Park and Pontpren SSSI consists of three separate blocks of land, encompassing an area of 
14.5ha in total. The nearest extent of this site lies approximately 1.2km to the northeast of the study site. 
This site is of special interest for the marsh fritillary butterfly Eurodryas aurina, which requires the 
diverse mosaic of marshy grassland, neutral grassland, heathland and woodland habitats and is the 
primary reason for this sites designation. This site and the nearby Cors Bryn-y-gaer SSSI (as described 
below) supports one of the largest metapopulations of marsh fritillary in south Wales.
Cors Bryn - y – Gaer Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
Cors Bryn –y- Gaer SSSI lies approximately 0.4km to the north of the study site, just on the northern side 
of the A461. It encompasses an area of 421ha and is noted as being of special interest due to its lowland 
bog and areas of soligenous flush, as well as the diversity of grassland habitats which occur in a complex 
with wet heath and swamp. This mosaic of habitats are of importance for marsh fritillary butterfly, for 
which the site is also designated. 
Blaen Cynon Special Area of Conservation (SAC)
Blaen Cynon SAC is comprised of both Woodland Park and Pontpren SSSI and Cors Bryn - y – Gaer 
SSSI, covering a total area of 66ha, and lies approximately 0.4km to the north of the study site. This 
reason for the designation of this site is for the Annex II species marsh fritillary butterfly.
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte Special Area of Conservation (SAC)
Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC lies approximately 1.4km to the northwest of the study site, covering an 
area of 378ha. The primary reasons for designation are the Annex 1 habitats; mixed woodland on alkaline
–rich soils associated with rocky slopes, and Western acidic oak woodland.

Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Mellte Moel Penderyn Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Mellte Moel Penderyn SSSI encompasses a large area of 420ha, the nearest extent of 
which is located approximately 1.4km northwest of the study site. A proportion of this site also lies within 
the Brecon Beacons National Park. This area is of particular special interest for its extensive semi-natural 
woodland and botanical diversity, in particular the important populations of flowering plants and the 
diverse assemblage of mosses, liverworts and lichens.
Non-statutory Designated Sites
The search area lies within the administrative area of Rhondda Cynan Taf County Borough Council, who 
have identified a series of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs).  The following SINCs lie 
within 2km of the site:  
Coed Wernhir SINC
Werfa Farm SINC
Rhigos Tramway SINC
Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC
Hirwaun Ponds SINC
Hirwaun Common SINC
Hirwaun Ponds (North) SINC
Hirwaun Iron Works SINC
None of the SINCs listed above form part of the development area. However, Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC is located immediately adjacent to the north and northwest of the study site, bordering the site 
boundary. This site supports a large mosaic of habitats centred around an ancient lowland peat bog, and 
provides excellent habitat for a diversity of invertebrate, reptile, amphibian and bird species.
Protected Species Records
Records of protected species were obtained from the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre 
SEWBReC. The following notable species and UK or European Protected Species were recorded within 
1km of the proposed development site:
Marsh fritillary (200m north)
Small pearl bordered fritillary (200m north)
Barn owl (290m northwest)

Site Description
The site forms part of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, which is located just on the outskirts of the town of 
Hirwaun, northwest of Aberdare in South Wales (NGR SN 938061) and south of the Brecon Beacons 
National Park. The study site is split into two areas, divided by Main Avenue road through the centre of 
the industrial estate. It lies in semi-rural surrounds, comprising a number of industrial buildings (some of 
which are in current use) and associated amenity, scrub and semi-improved neutral grassland habitats 
bordered by mixed plantation woodland and hedgerow/screen planting. Off site to the north is a large area 
of marshy grassland. One part of the site appears to comprise a former industrial area which has been 
disused for a considerable period.
4.3
Habitats and Vegetation
The site supports the following habitats:
structures and hardstanding;
poor semi-improved grassland;
semi-improved neutral grassland;
Unimproved grassland;
hedgerows and scattered trees; 
tall ruderal and scrub;
plantation woodland; 
watercourses;
ephemeral/short perennial; and 
introduced shrub.
Structures and Hardstanding
There are a number of buildings across the site, some of which are currently in use as industrial or office 
facilities and others which are now redundant. These comprise a mix of new and old industrial warehouse

32820 Final Report 12311i1
units, some of brick construction and others of corrugated metal, as well as smaller brick-built 
outbuildings and associated office facilities.  
A large proportion of the site is made up of hardstanding areas, forming the access roads, associated car 
parking facilities and road system throughout the units.
Poor semi-improved grassland
The grassland on site is primarily used for amenity purposes, providing landscaping to the surrounding 
buildings. However these areas are not closely mown and contain a more diverse sward of species than 
amenity grassland and as such these smaller pockets of grassland have been categorised as species poor 
semi improved grassland (TN1). Species present include perennial rye grass Lolium perenne, Yorkshire 
fog Holcus lanatus, creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, daisy Bellis perennis, broad-leaved dock 
Rumex obtusifolius and selfheal Prunella vulgaris.
Semi-improved neutral grassland
The larger, less enclosed areas of grassland, particularly in the north of the site (TN2) are more 
characteristic of semi-improved neutral grassland, with a greater diversity of grasses and herbaceous 
species including cocksfoot Dactylis glomerata, black medic Medicago lupulina, ribwort plantain 
Plantago lanceolata, tormentil Potentilla erecta and cinquefoil Potentilla reptens. Occasional patches of 
soft rush Juncus sp. are also present throughout.
Unimproved neutral grassland
The area of rank grassland habitat in the southeast of the site appears to have been left undeveloped for a 
considerable period of time (TN3). Grasses present include Yorkshire Fog Holcus lanatus and cocksfoot 
Dactylis Glomerata, with a rich diversity of herbaceous species and wildflowers, including red clover 
Trifolium  pratense, birds foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, black medic Medicago lupulina, oxeye daisy 
Leucanthemum vulgare, selfheal Prunella vulgaris,
Hedgerows and Scattered Trees
meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria, tormentil
Potentilla erecta, and ragged-robin Lychnis flos-cuculi. Occasional patches of common spotted orchid 
Dactylorhiza fuchsii was also observed to be present in this part of the site.
Occasional hedgerows are present within the site, however the majority appear to be of a denser and taller 
nature, forming more of a boundary screening to adjacent roads and land (as at TN5).
Scattered trees are also present throughout the areas of semi improved grassland, these vary widely in age 
and consist of a mixture of native and introduced ornamental species. Species present include Sycamore 
Acer pseudoplatanus, willow Salix sp., hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, silver birch Betula pendula, birch 
Betula sp. and cherry Prunus sp.

32820 Final Report 12311i1
Tall Ruderal and Scrub
Tall ruderal and scrub habitat on the site is primarily associated with the woodland edge habitats, forming 
a continuation of the understorey onto the more disturbed areas of ground, notable at TN6 adjacent to the 
woodland, as well as a further stand in the northwest of the site. Species present in these areas include 
rosebay willowherb Chamerion angustifolium, great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum, bramble Rubus 
fruticosus, common nettle Urtica dioica, black knapweed Centuarea nigra and ragwort Senecio jacobaea.
There are small stands of dense gorse Ulex europaeus and bramble within the unimproved grassland in 
the southeast at TN4.
Plantation Woodland
Mixed plantation woodland forms much of the habitat in the southernmost part of the site, bordering the 
site and forming a large strip which extends along the length of the south of the site and beyond the
boundary (TN7 and TN8). Species present include, but are not limited to, pine species Pinus sp.,
sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, rowan Sorbus aucuparia, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, elder
Sambucus nigra, ash Fraxinus excelsior, birch Betula sp., field maple Acer campestre and oak Quercus 
sp.. Understorey and ground flora species include common nettle, bramble, rosebay willowherb, elder, 
willow, butterfly bushBuddleia davidii, herb Robert Geranium robertianum and harts tongue fern 
Asplenium scolopendrium. A further strip of plantation woodland is present beyond the northern 
boundary of the site. 
A further strip is present in the north of the site, again forming the majority of the northernmost site 
boundary and extending beyond the site. This narrows out to the west, to form more of a screen planting 
with less mature trees. This area is dominated by alder Alnus glutinosa, willow Salix sp. and birch species 
Betula sp. (TN9).
Watercourses
There is one ditch on the site (TN10), in the north west corner, which flows through the area of semi-
improved grassland. At the time of survey it was holding only a very small amount of water, with species 
including bulrush Typha latifolia, horsetail Equesetum arvense and soft rush Juncus effusus dominating.
Ephemeral/short perennial
In the north and northwest corner of the site are two patches of ephemeral/short perennial vegetation that 
have colonised the more disturbed, stony areas of ground (TN14), with species including greater plantain 
Plantago major, ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, cat’s ear Hypochaeris radicata, coltsfoot 
Tussilago farfara and occasional grasses. Occasional patches of common spotted orchid Dactylorhiza
fuchsii were also observed to be present alongside these areas.

Introduced Shrub
Occasional stands of introduced shrub are present across the site although primarily associated with the 
areas of poor semi-improved grassland and further amenity areas around the buildings and car parks.
4.4
Fauna
Bats
Potential Roosting Habitat
A small number of the older buildings across the site support gaps and features within the building 
structure which could be considered as potential access points, or present suitable roosting habitat for bat 
species. In particular the two buildings in the southern section of the site, at target notes TN11 and TN12
were noted to support such features, as well as the larger building in the far northwest of the site at TN13:
The building at TN11 is brick built with a pitched tile roof, which appears to support an enclosed internal 
loft space. A number of the windows are currently boarded up. Features in the form of raised and gappy 
roof tiles, rotten fascia boards and cladding may provide suitable access points for roosting opportunities. 
This building is considered to support moderate bat roosting potential.
The adjacent building at TN12 is also brick-built with a flat felt roof and protruding skylights. The 
brickwork is in a particularly poor state of repair in places, with significantly cracked brickwork and gaps 
around the window frames which may provide opportunities for roosting within the cavity walls. This 
building is considered to support moderate bat roosting potential.
The further building at TN13 is of brick construction with a pitched corrugated roof. Similarly the 
brickwork appears to be in a poor state of repair, with a large number of cracks, crevices and holes which 
may provide opportunities for roosting within the cavity walls. This building is considered to support 
moderate bat roosting potential.
There are no mature trees throughout the site that support features of potential for roosting bats, however 
it is possible that some of the trees within the woodland areas on the fringes of the site, particularly along 
the southern boundary, are suitable for use by bats.
Potential Commuting and Foraging Habitat
Bats tend to commute between roosting/foraging habitats by using linear features, such as 
hedgerows/river corridors etc as flight lines. 
The plantation woodland in the south of the site (TN7 &TN8), and the area also lying just to the north, off 
site, may be used as a commuting feature and provide edge habitat for foraging. Further suitable foraging 
habitat is provided on and around the site by the hedgerows, scattered trees and scrub, although is

32820 Final Report 12311i1
primarily limited to the fringing areas, all of which provide habitat for invertebrates which are the prey of 
UK bat species.  
The site is in a semi-rural location, and is well connected to expanses of open habitat and woodland 
providing foraging and roosting opportunities in the wider countryside, largely via a network of trees and 
hedgerows. The Hirwaun railway line and sidings that lies to the north of the industrial estate is an ideal 
linear feature which further connects the study area to areas of natural/semi-natural habitat in the wider 
area.
Great Crested Newts 
There are no ponds that were identified on the study site which could provide potential breeding habitat 
for amphibians such as the European Protected great-crested newt. The wet ditch on site held very little 
water at the time of survey and could provide some, albeit limited potential breeding habitat for this 
species.  However, there is one small pond identified just beyond the southern site boundary within the 
woodland area which may provide suitable habitat, although access to assess this was not possible at the 
time of the survey to be able to assess its suitability.
Examination of Ordnance Survey and aerial maps show there to be further clusters of ponds to the east 
and south of the site (eleven ponds in total lying within 500m) which may provide breeding habitat for 
this species. During their terrestrial phase, this mobile species may range up to 500 metres (per year) from 
a breeding pond; therefore it is considered that there is potential for this species to occur on the study site.
The areas of habitat around the fringes of the site, in particular the expanses of woodland as well as the 
area of rank grassland and scrub in the southeast of the site, may provide suitable terrestrial habitat and 
opportunities for foraging, shelter and protection for great crested newts.
Reptiles
The areas of habitat around the fringes of the site, including the expanses of woodland and particularly 
the area of rank grassland and scrub in the southeast of the site, may also provide suitable basking, 
foraging and sheltering habitat for reptiles. With connectivity to other surrounding habitats it is possible 
that species such as slow worms and common lizards could be encountered. The remainder of the site 
area, being primarily built structures, hardstanding and amenity areas however, is not considered to offer 
any opportunities to be utilised for reptiles.
Badgers
The areas of plantation woodland habitat around the study site, in particular the denser area in the south of 
the site, provides suitable habitat for badgers. These areas were searched for signs of setts or evidence of 
badgers, however it was not possible to access all areas of the woodland to survey. No evidence of 
badgers was recorded at the time of the survey, although their presence on site cannot be ruled out due to 
the inaccessibility of some areas.

Invertebrates
Large numbers of Marsh fritillary butterfly have been recorded in close proximity to the site boundary, 
just to the northeast. Records of small pearl-bordered fritillary, which is a LBAP species have also been 
recorded nearby. 
The natural pattern of the marsh fritillary’s existence is in metapopulations whose survival is dependent 
upon having a network of nearby patches within which there is periodic extinction and re-colonisation i.e. 
areas where not all the habitat is occupied by the butterfly all of the time (Warren, 1994). Across the UK, 
the marsh fritillary butterfly breeds in two main agriculturally unimproved habitats, damp neutral or acid 
grasslands (often described as “rhôs pastures” in Wales) and dry chalk and limestone grasslands. Its 
larval foodplant is devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis. In Wales, the butterfly is present in networks of 
unimproved, but extensively cattle or pony grazed, marshy pastures and drier neutral grasslands. Habitats 
require a degree of light grazing to maintain them in suitable condition for the butterfly to breed and the 
presence of a network of such sites are required for the long-term maintenance of the species.
The fringe habitats on the site, in particular the mosaic of species-rich grassland and scrub in the 
southeast section of the site, support a fairly rich diversity of botanical species which have the potential to 
support a variety of invertebrate species. Several common butterfly and moth species were noted to be 
using the areas of grassland. Although the larval food plant of the marsh fritillary has not been recorded 
on site, it is possible that these grassland areas may be used for nectaring or as a stepping stone to 
facilitate movement with a metapopulation.
Other Species
Common breeding birds are likely to be using the plantation woodland, hedgerows and scrub as nesting 
and foraging sites.  Ground nesting birds such as skylark and meadow pipit may use the unimproved 
grassland on site.  It is also possible that the buildings on site may be used for breeding/nesting during the 
breeding season. A number of Schedule 1 bird species have been recorded using parts of the Industrial 
Estate, beyond the study site boundary, including Barn Owl, Peregrine Falcon and Red Kite.

Limitations
These scoping surveys were undertaken during an optimal period (June to October); as such it was 
possible to undertake a suitable evaluation of the habitats present on site, their potential to support 
protected species and to draw suitable conclusions.
The lack of evidence of a protected species does not preclude their possible presence at a later date. This 
is particularly true of bats; their use of a particular tree/building/structure/etc. can significantly vary, not 
only on a seasonal basis, but also from day to day.
Whilst every effort was made to survey all parts of the site, access was restricted to a small part of the site 
due to demolition and construction works already being underway, making the habitats in this area 
inaccessible for close up inspection. Access to survey the woodland habitat to the south of the site was 
also restricted given the tall security fence around the perimeter of the industrial units. This also carried 
some implications for inspecting this habitat for suitability for/signs of protected species, such as badgers
and bats.
However, in spite of these limitations, it is considered that this scoping study will allow a robust and 
professional judgement to be made on the broad ecological value of the site and will adequately inform 
recommendations for further survey and/or mitigation.

Conclusions and Summary of Ecological 
Value 
Designated Sites
There are no designated sites within the proposed development boundary. There are, however, six 
Statutory Designated sites within 2km of the site; The Brecon Beacons National Park,  Woodland Park 
and Pontpren SSSI, Cors Bryn - y – Gaer SSSI, Blaen Cynon SAC, Coedydd Nedd a Mellte SAC and 
Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Mellte Moel Penderyn SSSI. With the exception of the National Park, the nearest of 
these lies 0.4km from the study site boundary. Whilst the assessment was limited to the area shown 
(etched yellow) on Figure 1 it is understood that the proposed development may include the installation of 
pipelines and cables off site. In view of this and given the close proximity to these sites, some of which 
are European Protected sites, it is possible that a Habitat Regulations Assessment may be required.
In view of the possible requirement for off-site infrastructure and the extremely close proximity of the 
study site to a non-statutory designated Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, consideration may 
also need to be given to any potential impacts to this locally important area of conservation interest. 
Habitats and Vegetation
The main ecological value of the site lies within the buildings and mixed plantation woodland which 
provide possible roost sites for bats. The woodland may also be used by bats as flight lines and foraging 
habitat. The area of unimproved neutral grassland which provides a mosaic of grassland and scrub, 
species rich in places is also considered to be of ecological value. Although not extensive, it is botanically 
rich and provides good habitat for a range of common moth and butterfly species, with the potential to 
support larval food plants for invertebrates of potential significance. This may include marsh fritillary,
which have been recorded in the nearby area and is afforded full protection in the UK. The woodland 
habitat on and bordering the site is further considered to be of moderate value for badgers, providing 
suitable habitat for foraging and the construction of setts. The wider site provides further, albeit low 
opportunities for foraging.  This woodland also provides habitat for a range of common breeding birds. 
The areas of habitat around the fringes of the site, in particular the expanses of woodland as well as the 
area of rank grassland and scrub in the southeast and northwest of the site, may provide suitable habitat 
for great crested newts and, to a lesser extent, common reptiles.
The habitats on site comprise ‘Industrial Estates’ and ‘Roadside Verges’ which are both included in the 
Rhondda Cynan Taf  LBAP .

32820 Final Report 12311i1
Protected/Notable Species
Bats
The site presents potential roosting, commuting and foraging habitat for a range of species. Some of the 
old buildings on site support gaps and features within the building structure which could be considered as 
potential access points, or present suitable roosting habitat for bat species. It is possible that some of the 
trees within the woodland areas on and bordering the site are suitable for use by bats.
Badgers
No badger setts or signs of badgers were identified during survey, however not all areas of woodland 
could be accessed and one survey is not sufficient to confirm absence of this species.
Breeding Birds
A range of common breeding birds are likely to use the woodland and scrub areas as nesting, foraging and 
refuge habitat. Ground nesting birds such as skylark and meadow pipit may use the unimproved grassland 
on site. The buildings on site may be used for breeding/nesting during the breeding season.
Great Crested Newts
There are no ponds present on site. The ditch on site held very little water at the time of survey and is 
considered unlikely to support great crested newts.  However, there is one small pond identified just 
beyond the southern site boundary within the woodland area, to which access was not possible to be able 
to assess its suitability for this species. A number of further ponds have been identified within 500m of 
the site (to the south, and to the east) which may provide further suitable breeding habitat. The proposed 
development site does provide potential foraging, shelter and hibernation habitat for this species.
Invertebrates
The botanically rich unimproved grassland habitat on the proposed development site provides suitable 
habitat for a range of invertebrate species. There are a larger number of records of the fully protected 
marsh fritillary butterfly in close proximity to the site, including within nearby statutory sites, for which 
this species is the primary reason for their designation. 
Reptiles
There are no records of reptile species in proximity to the site, however the habitats present on site 
present suitable habitat for use by common reptile species and it is possible that they are using the site for 
basking foraging and possibly hibernation.

6.1
Summary of Ecological Value
The main ecological value of the site lies in the potential use of the site by bats in particular the roosting 
opportunities presented by a number of the buildings, as well as the potential for bats and badgers to be 
using the woodland habitat. The botanical interest of the unimproved grassland area is also of ecological 
value, including the potential to support a diversity of invertebrate species and potential larval food plants 
for invertebrates of potential significance.  The habitats present on site may also present opportunities for 
use by great crested newts, breeding birds and to a lesser extent, common reptiles.

Recommendations
It is recommended that the following surveys are undertaken to gain more detailed ecological information 
on the use of the site by protected flora and fauna:
Further bat scoping survey of the buildings identified on site; inspection of potential access points 
using an endoscope, along with dusk and dawn emergence/re-entry surveys will determine the 
presence/likely absence of roosting bats at these sites. Robust dusk/dawn bat surveys can be 
undertaken from approximately April to September, depending on weather conditions;
If the proposed development works are likely to encroach into fringing woodland areas it is 
recommended that further surveys are undertaken to assess the use of the woodland by bats and to 
identify any suitable trees which may provide roosting habitat for bats;
Further badger survey of the woodland areas in the south of the site and bordering the north of the
site;
Botanical survey of the site to establish presence/absence of any protected or notable plants or 
potential larval food plants for invertebrates of potential significance;
Invertebrate survey to establish presence/absence of any protected or notable invertebrate species.
Given that there are nearby records of the marsh fritillary and that this species is the primary reason 
for the designation of nearby statutory sites, should a Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) be 
required it may be necessary to review the position of this site in relation to other known marsh 
fritillary sites in the wider area; and
Further assessment and great crested newt survey of the ponds identified as lying on/just beyond 
the site boundary and those lying within 500m
The above recommendations are based on the development details available to date. Once further details 
are made available further detailed surveys may be required and it is recommended that CCW and the 
local County Ecologist are consulted to confirm the scope and extent of required surveys and 
assessments.

TN7 & TN8
Mixed plantation woodland forming much of the habitat in the southernmost part of the 
site, forming a large strip which extends along the length of the south of the site and 
beyond the  boundary. Species present include pine species Pinus sp., sycamore Acer 
pseudoplatanus, rowan Sorbus aucuparia, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, elder 
Sambucus nigra, ash Fraxinus excelsior, birch Betula sp., field maple Acer campestre 
and oak Quercus sp.. Understorey and ground flora species include common nettle
Urtica dioica, bramble Rubus fruticosus, rosebay willowherb Epilobium angustifolium,
elder Sambucus nigra, willow Salix sp, butterfly bush Buddleia davidii, herb robert 
Geranium robertianum and harts tongue fern Asplenium scolopendrium. This woodland 
has the potential to provide suitable habitat for bats and badgers, and may provide 
suitable terrestrial habitat for great crested newts.  
TN9
A further strip of plantation woodland just beyond the northern boundary which narrows 
out to the west to form more of a screen planting with less mature trees. This area is 
dominated by alder Alnus glutinosa, willow Salix sp. and birch species Betula sp.
TN10
Small ditch which flows through the area of semi-improved grassland. At the time of 
survey it was holding only a very small amount of water, with species including 
bulrush Typha latifolia, horsetail Equesetum arvense and soft rush Juncus effusus
dominating.
TN11
The building at TN11 is brick built with a pitched tile roof, which appears to support an 
enclosed internal loft space. The windows are currently boarded up. Features in the form 
of raised and gappy roof tiles, rotten fascia boards and cladding may provide suitable 
access points for roosting opportunities – moderate bat roosting potential.
TN12
Adjacent building at TN12 is also brick-built with a flat felt roof and protruding 
skylights. The brickwork is in a particularly poor state of repair in places, with 
significantly cracked brickwork and gaps around the window frames which may 
provide opportunities for roosting within the cavity walls – moderate bat roosting 
potential.
TN13
The further building at TN13 is of brick construction with a pitched corrugated roof. 
Similarly the brickwork appears to be in a poor state of repair, with a large number of 
cracks, crevices and holes which may provide opportunities for roosting within the 
cavity walls. This building is considered to support moderate bat roosting potential –
moderate bat roosting potential. 
TN14
Area of ephemeral/short perennial on the more shallow/stony soil. Species include
greater plantain Plantago major, ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, cat’s ear 
Hypochaeris radicata, coltsfoot Tussilago farfara and occasional grasses.

Description:
Dyffrynnoedd Nedd a Mellte, a Moel Penderyn is of special interest for its extensive and diverse 
semi-natural woodland, important populations of several flowering plants and supporting 
outstanding assemblages of mosses, liverworts and lichens.  The site includes a range of 
geological features, well-exposed in the cliffs and rocky river beds.  These include exposures at 
Moel Penderyn, Craig y Ddinas and Bwa Maen and geomorphological features within parts of 
the valleys of the Hepste and Mellte are also of special interest. 
This site includes the wooded valleys of the rivers Nedd and Mellte, and their tributaries above 
Pontneddfechan, as they pass through a Millstone Grit and limestone plateau, and Moel 
Penderyn, which lies to the east.  The plateau lies at about 300 m, the rivers having eroded deep, 
narrow valleys with gorges, river cliffs, block scree and waterfalls. 
GEOLOGY
The old quarry faces and rock outcrops at Craig y Ddinas and Moel Penderyn provide important 
exposures of geological structures formed during the Variscan Orogeny, late in the 
Carboniferous and early in the Permian periods of geological history.  The Carboniferous 
Limestone layers are steeply tilted on Craig y Ddinas, as a result of folding, and small tight folds 
can be seen in the banks of the River Sychryd. The exposed Dinas fault, a major dislocation of 
the crust, is marked by a belt of shattered limestone associated with several minor fractures.  
Numerous other small structures occur, including faults, fractures, veins and folds.  This complex 
assemblage of structures makes up a narrow belt called the Neath Disturbance, which extends 
from the Welsh Borders to the Gower Peninsula.  The Disturbance probably lies above an 
ancient line of weakness in the deep crust reactivated during the Variscan Orogeny.  These 
localities provide the best exposures of this important feature of the geological structure of South 
Wales. 
The best exposure in South Wales of the rock strata of the Gastrioceras subcrenatum Marine 
Band (below the Farewell Rock) in its full development occurs in the valley of the Nedd Fechan. 
 The full range of environment types is represented in the marine band section, including 
brackish water with a restricted fauna and off-shore marine environments with a goniatite-rich 
fauna.  The site is important in understanding how this brief marine incursion occurred, which, in 
turn, is important because the marine band, the expression of this event in the rocks, is taken to 
indicate the start of the Westphalian Epoch of Carboniferous time. 
The Nedd, Mellte and Sychryd, forming the headwaters of the Afon Nedd, provide key 
exposures of Carboniferous rocks.  These include extensive and spectacular exposures of the 
whole Namurian of the North Crop.  In particular, the Basal Grits are well exposed and present 
the best available section in the Main South Wales Basin.  The predominantly shaley sequences 
of the higher Namurian are also well exposed here and their study has been of great importance 
in the elucidation of the stratigraphy of the Namurian.  Additional importance attaches to the 
presence of a varied and abundant Basal Grit flora.  These are outstanding, nationally important 
sections of the Carboniferous. 
The river system is exceptional in showing the combined effects of geological controls and 
changing sea levels in river landform development.  Faulting has juxtaposed rocks of varying 
resistance and influenced the form and evolution of waterfalls.  Thus the landforms of this area 
reflect a variety of interacting controls, and both the total assemblage as well as the individual 
features are important. 
BIOLOGY
This site supports one of the most extensive and diverse areas of semi-natural woodland in 
Wales.  The predominant woodland vegetation communities are characteristic of the uplands of 
north and western Britain, with extensive areas of oak Quercus spp. woodland, and smaller areas 
of ash Fraxinus excelsior woodland.  The distribution of the particular communities reflects the 
distribution of soils of low, moderate and high base status, respectively.  More locally, however, 
the aspects and microclimate have allowed the development of the southern and eastern lowland 
counterparts of these free-draining oak, birch Betula spp. and ash-dominated woodlands. 
Large areas of the site have a woodland canopy dominated by oak intermediate in character 
between the sessile oak Quercus petraea and the pedunculate oak Q. robur, with a little downy 
birch Betula pubescens and small-leaved lime Tilia cordata in places.  Here, the shrub layer is 
absent or sparse with a little hazel Corylus avellana or rowan Sorbus aucuparia.  The field layer 
is typically dominated by wavy hair-grass Deschampsia flexuosa, with bilberry Vaccinium
myrtillus present and, where grazing is relatively light, quite abundant.  The ground layer has a 
very high cover of mosses, including Rhytidiadelphus loreus, Polytrichum formosum, Dicranum
majus, Plagiothecium undulatum, Hypnum cupressiforme, Mnium hornum and Sphagnum
quinquefarium.  Elsewhere, large stands of similar canopy and shrub layer composition have a 
ground layer typically dominated by wavy hair-grass with common bent Agrostis capillaris and 
some sweet vernal-grass Anthoxanthum odoratum.  Purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea is 
present occasionally and is sometimes abundant, while bilberry is absent or very rare except on 
inaccessible ledges and cliffs.  The ground layer often has carpets of the bryophytes mentioned 
above.
Another woodland community that occurs extensively in some parts of the site is dominated by 
sessile oak and forms intermediate with pedunculate oak, or downy birch, or a mixture.  Other 
canopy trees are rare and the shrub layer is typically sparse, but in some areas dense hazel and 
scattered hawthorn Crataegus monogyna are present.  The field layer is grassy, with common 
bent, sweet vernal-grass and creeping soft-grass Holcus mollis often abundant with patchy wavy 
hair-grass.  Other species that occur here are wood-sorrel Oxalis acetosella, bluebell 
Hyacinthoides non-scripta, bracken Pteridium aquilinum and heath bedstraw Galium saxatile
and the mosses Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and Polytrichum formosum.
Small stands of woodland, particularly along steep tributary stream valleys are dominated by ash 
with a dense shrub layer of hazel, a little hawthorn and locally frequent rowan.  No single species 
is dominant in the field layer, but wood-sorrel, false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum, common 
bent, lady-fern Athyrium filix-femina and rough meadow-grass Poa trivialis are all locally 
frequent.  In the ground layer, mosses and liverworts are prominent, with Plagiomnium
undulatum, Mnium hornum, Atrichum undulatum, Pellia sp., and Ctenidium molluscum all 
frequent and often abundant.  The ground flora in these areas can be extremely rich and includes 
species that are scarce in mid and south Wales, such as wood fescue Festuca altissima.
The canopy in one area of the site is composed mainly of intermediate oak, with a little downy 
birch in places.  The shrub layer is sparse, with only scattered hazel and holly Ilex aquifolium.
The field layer is a carpet of wavy hair-grass with few other species present, although bracken 
occurs in places.  Mosses are sometimes quite prominent in scattered tufts, especially 
Polytrichum formosum and Mnium hornum.
In another area, the canopy mostly comprises intermediate oak and occasional ash with a 
relatively dense shrub layer, primarily of hazel, but with scattered holly and rowan.  The field 
layer is dominated by three species: bramble Rubus fruticosus, bracken and creeping soft-grass 
with frequent wavy hair-grass. 
Small patches of woodland on open, steep cliffs and screes, particularly of limestone, are 
dominated by ash and are relatively species-rich, with many calcicoles.  On shadier steep cliffs, 
similarly ash-dominated patches are relatively species-poor, with abundant ivy Hedera helix and 
some calcicoles.  In small areas of woodland at the base of shadier steep cliffs, scattered field 
maple Acer campestre occurs in the shrub layer, beneath a canopy of ash.  The field layer 
includes species such as dog's mercury Mercurialis perennis, herb-Robert Geranium
robertianum, common nettle Urtica dioica, cleavers Galium aparine and, where bouldery, hart’s-
tongue Phyllitis scolopendrium.
Elsewhere, soils with impeded drainage or flushing support an extensive area of alder Alnus
glutinosa-dominated woodland, in a range of topographical situations.  Wet flushes within this 
type of woodland provide the most southerly known locality in Britain for marsh hawk’s-beard 
Crepis paludosa.  There are small patches of woodland where alder is dominant, with a little ash 
and downy birch over a shrub layer of hazel.  Here, the field layer is generally dominated by 
remote sedge Carex remota with many other species present in small amounts.  Elsewhere, 
extensive stands of alder-dominated woodland have a relatively dense shrub layer, primarily 
composed of hazel but often with ash saplings, hawthorn and downy birch saplings.  The ground 
layer is dominated by tufted hair-grass Deschampsia cespitosa, with wood-sorrel and lady-fern.  
Further areas have a canopy mostly of alder with occasional downy birch and little of a shrub 
layer except scattered ash saplings.  The field layer is a mixture of meadowsweet Filipendula
vulgaris, creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, false brome, soft-rush, great horsetail 
Equisetum telmateia and bramble.  In the ground layer, the mosses Eurhynchium praelongum
and Thuidium tamariscinum are frequent. 
Locally, where woodland extends onto the drift-covered plateau, stands of a community 
dominated by alder with occasional downy birch, rowan and ash are present.  There is no shrub 
layer and the field layer is dominated by purple moor-grass, with frequent bramble, soft-rush 
Juncus effusus and broad buckler-fern Dryopteris dilatata.  Scattered, relatively small patches of 
a similar type of woodland have the same canopy trees and a typically sparse or absent shrub 
layer.  The field layer here is always dominated by purple moor-grass, with soft-rush, tormentil 
Potentilla erecta, creeping soft-grass, tufted hair-grass and common bent typically present.  In 
the ground layer, bog moss Sphagnum recurvum and hair moss Polytrichum commune are 
usually present. 
The overall botanical diversity is outstanding, with more than 600 species of plant having been 
recorded from the site.  This includes a very large proportion of the bryophyte flora of mid and 
south Wales. 
The high humidity of much of the woodland has a strong influence on its botanical diversity.  
Trees and rocks support a diverse assemblage of plant species largely confined in their 
distribution to the Atlantic Seaboard of Europe.  These Atlantic species include green spleenwort 
Asplenium viride, Tunbridge filmy-fern H. tunbridgense, hay-scented buckler-fern Dryopteris
aemula, all of which are rare in south Wales, liverworts, such as Bazzania trilobata, Jubula
hutchinsiae and the scarce Anastrophyllum hellerianum, Colura calyptrifolia, Jamesoniella
autumnalis and Sphenolobopsis pearsonii, mosses, such as Isothecium holtii, Dichodontium
denudatum and the scarce Bartramia hallerana and Seligera acutifolius, lichens, such as 
Enterographa hutchinsii, Micarea alabastrites, the rare Micarea hedlundii, and the scarce 
Micarea stipitata and Phyllopsora roseii.  These contrast with the local abundance of more 
continental species such as, on logs, the scarce moss Dicranum flagellare, on gritstone cliffs, the 
scarce lichen Chrysothrix chlorina and, on bark, the scarce lichen Micarea pycnidiophora.
Boulder screes, cliff faces, springs, seepages, decaying logs and mature and overmature trees 
provide some of the specific habitats required by several scarce lower plants demanding 
conditions that are subject to little change with time, including the lichens Leptogium plicatile
and L. subtile, and the liverwort Cephalozia catenulata.  Despite recent high levels of 
atmospheric pollution, the epiphytic Lobarion lichen community persists in these sheltered 
valleys and includes species such as Lecanactis premnea, Biatora sphaeroides, Parmeliella
triptophylla and Dimerella lutea.
The rivers, with their fine waterfalls, are an integral part of the site with the splash zones and 
spray providing wetness and humidity necessary for many species.  River courses support a 
notable riparian flora dominated by liverworts, and mosses, including the nationally scarce 
Fissidens rufulus and F. rivularis, and Tetrodontium brownianum, which is threatened in Europe. 
The woodland in the valleys is interspersed with several more open habitats that provide 
additional interest.  As well as the cliffs, screes and rivers there are extensive areas of grassland 
dominated by common bent and sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina. There are also patches of less 
acidic grassland in the valley bottoms and, at Craig y Ddinas and Moel Penderyn, the limestone 
supports calcareous grassland.  Wet grassland dominated by purple moor-grass or rushes (Juncus
spp.) occurs in a series of flushes along the valley sides and bracken-dominated glades are 
widespread.  Patches of dry heath and wet heath characterised by deergrass Scirpus cespitosus
and cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix can be found in Hepste valley.
Other habitats of interest include areas of beech Fagus sylvatica plantation, grey willow Salix
cinerea and bramble scrub and nutrient-rich ponds. 
The fauna of these valleys is well developed, and includes birds such as breeding dipper, grey 
wagtail, goosander, pied flycatcher, redstart, wood warbler, woodcock, buzzard and 
sparrowhawk.

Description:
Cors Bryn-y-gaer is of special interest for its lowland bog and for areas of soligenous flush, 
marshy grassland, dry neutral grassland and lowland acid grassland. These habitats occur in a 
complex with wet heath, swamp and semi-improved grassland. The site is also of special interest 
for the marsh fritillary butterfly Eurodryas aurinia.
The site is located immediately north-west of Hirwaun and south of the Brecon Beacons National 
Park.  Cors Bryn-y-gaer is situated at the northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield, on glacial 
boulder clay, with areas of deep peat on lower ground.  Several small water courses and springs 
are associated with the site, which is in the catchment of the Afon Cynon. The altitude varies 
from 205 to 220m. The main part of the site comprises several drumlins (smooth oval hills of 
glacial drift) interspersed with lower lying flat ground. A series of enclosed fields form the 
northern margin. Also included within the site are two small level fields situated 500 m to the 
south of the main block of land;  these fields are bisected by the A4059 Hirwaun-Penderyn road. 
The lowland bog at Cors Bryn-y-gaer is actively peat forming. The vegetation is characterised by 
a carpet of bog moss Sphagnum cuspidatum, together with species such as deergrass 
Trichophorum cespitosum, hare’s tail cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum and round-leaved 
sundew Drosera rotundifolia. In slightly drier areas cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix becomes 
more abundant and there is a greater range of bog moss species Sphagnum spp., whilst in the 
wettest areas common cottongrass Eriophorum angustifolium is frequent. 
Areas of acidic soligenous flush (under the influence of slow flowing mineral-rich ground or 
surface waters) cover most of the remaining deep peat between the drumlins.  Here the 
vegetation is dominated by sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus over a carpet of bog moss.  
Associated species include purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea, heath wood-rush Luzula
multiflora and tormentil Potentilla erecta. More sedge-rich flushes, with abundant carnation 
sedge Carex panicea, frequent bog asphodel Narthecium ossifragum and common cottongrass 
occur locally. 
Marshy grassland is common on sloping ground on drumlins throughout Cors Bryn-y-gaer. 
Much of this grassland is dominated by purple moor-grass together with species such as sheep’s 
fescue Festuca ovina and tormentil. In places, this grassland is slightly heathy with frequent 
heath rush Juncus squarrosus and occasional cross-leaved heath. Elsewhere grasses are more 
prominent, including sweet vernal-grass Anthoxanthum oderatum and heath grass Danthonia
decumbens.  Small patches where the soil is slightly less acidic are distinguished by the presence 
of meadow thistle Cirsium dissectum.
Areas of marshy grassland dominated by rushes such as soft rush Juncus effusus and sharp-
flowered rush are also present throughout Cors Bryn-y-gaer. Associated species include frequent 
marsh bedstraw Galium palustre, devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis and greater bird’s-foot-
trefoil Lotus pedunculatus.
Other habitats found at Cors Bryn-y-gaer include dry acid and neutral grassland. The neutral 
grassland is characterised by a range of grasses including common bent Agrostis capillaris, red 
fescue Festuca rubra and crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus, together with common 
knapweed Centaurea nigra and common bird’s-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus. On the lower 
slopes of the drumlins this community often grades into the more extensive acid grassland 
community, containing frequent sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and bird’s-foot trefoil. Several 
small areas of wet heath also occur in association with marshy grassland and acid flush. These 
typically include frequent purple moor-grass, along with deergrass, cross-leaved heath and a 
range of mosses. 
Many of the plant communities are closely juxtaposed, with well displayed transitions between 
them. Other habitats present on the site include small patches of swamp, inundation vegetation 
and scrub which add to the ecological and structural diversity of the site. 
The nationally scarce marsh fritillary butterfly is associated with the marshy grassland, in which 
its larval food plant, devil’s bit scabious, is frequent and widespread.
Cors Bryn-y-gaer also supports a population of cruet collar moss Splachnum ampullaceum, a 
nationally declining species, scarce in south Wales. This moss occurs mainly in lowland wet 
pastures, where it grows on decaying cattle and sheep dung.
Remarks:
Cors Bryn-y-gaer SSSI and the nearby Woodland Park/Pontpren SSSI support one of the largest 
metapopulations of marsh fritillary in South Wales.  These two sites comprise the Blaen Cynon 
candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). 
Cors Bryn-y-gaer supports the following UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitats: lowland 
raised bog, purple moor-grass and rush pasture, fen, lowland acid grassland and lowland 
meadow. 
The marsh fritillary is included on Annex IIa of the EC Habitats and Species Directive (Directive 
92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora) and Schedule 
5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and is a Biodiversity Action Plan 
species.

Description:
Woodland Park and Pontpren is of special for the interest for the marsh fritillary butterfly 
Eurodryas aurinia. Additional special interest is provided by its mixture of habitat types, 
including marshy grassland, dry acid and neutral grassland, heathland and woodland, which add 
to the ecological and biodiversity interest of the site and which also provide food and shelter 
necessary for the survival of the marsh fritillary.     
This site consists of three separate blocks of land, approximately 1km south of the village of 
Penderyn. The underlying geology is of Namurian and Westphalian sandstones, overlain by 
stagnohumic gleyed soils.  Drainage is impeded across most of the site. The altitude ranges from 
210 to 265m. 
A variety of purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea-dominated communities are present at the site. 
The largest stands, in the north-western block, were planted with trees in 1995 and are rather 
tussocky and species-poor. Smaller areas of tussocky vegetation with an abundance of tall herbs 
such as wild angelica Angelica sylvestris, are present in the southern block.  Scattered throughout 
the site are small, grassier stands, with species such as sheep’s-fescue Festuca ovina, sweet 
vernal-grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, small sedges Carex spp. and tormentil Potentilla erecta.
Heathier areas have cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and bog mosses Sphagnum spp.. 
Small patches of fen-meadow, with abundant meadow thistle Cirsium dissectum, tawny sedge 
Carex hostiana  and flea sedge C. pulicaris, occur scattered in all three blocks of land and, more 
locally, there are base-enriched flushes with a high cover of bryophytes such as Bryum
pseudotriquetrum and Campylium stellatum.
Marshy grassland with a high cover of sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and soft-rush J.
effusus occurs in the eastern and southern blocks, where it sometimes grades into tall-herb fen 
dominated by meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria or damp grassland dominated by tufted hair-
grass Deschampsia cespitosa.
On better drained soils there are small areas of acid and neutral grassland and bracken. The acid 
grassland is characterised by species such as common bent Agrostis capillaris, sheep’s-fescue, 
heath bedstraw Galium saxatile and tormentil. Common species in the neutral grassland include 
crested dog’s-tail Cynosurus cristatus, common bird’s-foot-trefoil Lotus corniculatus and red 
clover Trifolium pratense.
Devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis, the larval food plant of the marsh fritillary, is widespread 
and abundant in most of the wet and dry pasture at the site. It is also common in ditches in   
planted areas in the north-west of the site. Flowers of plants such as meadow thistle, provide a 
nectar source for the adult marsh fritillary. 
Stands of broadleaved woodland and scrub occur throughout the site. On wetter ground, the main 
species are alder Alnus glutinosa and willow Salix spp., with oak Quercus spp. and birch Betula
pubescens common on more free-draining soils.  
Remarks:
Woodland Park and Pontpren SSSI and the nearby Cors Bryn-y-gaer SSSI support one of the 
largest metapopulations of marsh fritillary in south Wales. These two sites comprise the Blaen 
Cynon Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). 
The marsh fritillary is included on Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended) and Annex IIa of the EC Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation 
of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora) and is a priority Biodiversity Action Plan  
species.
The site, apart from the most southerly field, lies within the Brecon Beacons National Park.
