Appendix 11.4 Visually Verified Montages and 
Methodology 
A.1 
Visually Verified Montages Methodology 
1.1.1 
This section has been prepared by AECOM to explain the 
methodology used for the production of the Visually Verified 
Montages (VVMs) for the Project. 
1.1.2 
The purpose of a VVM is to present an accurate visualisation of 
the Project, enabling its impact on the skyline, surrounding area 
and setting to be objectively evaluated. This methodology 
complies with the current photography and photomontage advice 
note, which can be found here:

viceNote01-11.pdf  
1.1.3 
Photographs and VVMs often form an important part of planning 
applications and Environmental Statements, in which the 
preparation and presentation of reliable visual information is 
integral to the assessment of landscape and visual effects. 
Photographs and VVMs are technical documents in this context, 
and should be produced and used in a technically appropriate 
manner. 
a) Objectives 
1.1.4 
The overall aim of a VVM is to represent both the landscape 
context under consideration and the proposed development, as 
accurately as is practical. 
1.1.5 
The objective of a VVM is to simulate the likely visual changes 
that would result from a proposed development, and to produce 
printed images of a size and resolution sufficient to match the 
perspective in the same view in the field. 
1.1.6 
VVMs use photographs of an actual scene modified by the 
insertion of an accurate representation of the visible changes 
brought about by the Proposed Development. They are subject to 
the same inherent limitations as photographs, for example only 
showing the scene as it would appear under the same conditions 
that prevailed when the original photograph was captured. A 
properly constructed VVM can serve as a useful tool to illustrate 
the likely visual change that would result from a proposed 
development 
b) Photography 
i. Digital Photography 
1.1.7 
Changes in all aspects of photography and VVMs have taken 
place over the last ten years. 35mm colour film and the 
associated cameras and lenses have been almost completely 
supplanted by digital cameras; digital image processing is now a 
fundamental element of photography, both within the firmware of 
the camera and as a subsequent operation on a computer.  
1.1.8 
Printing has similarly become wholly digital, using a wide variety
of devices offering different qualities of output. Future changes
will undoubtedly further change the parameters for landscape
photography. A good quality camera and lens are essential to the
production of photographs and VVMs for landscape and visual
impact assessment work.
ii. Digital Camera & Lenses
1.1.9 
High resolution digital photography was captured with a Canon
EOS 5D Mk III, a full-frame digital camera using a variety of fixed
focal-length lenses to accommodate the necessary scope of the
Development and relevant context. The camera was fixed to a
tripod 1.5m above ground.
iii. Data capture
1.1.10 
The photographer was provided with location information
indicating the position of each viewpoint from which the required
photographs were to be taken, plus a digital photograph of the
desired view. For each photograph, the camera was positioned at
a height of 1.5m above the ground level to approximate the
human eye level. OS Location of the camera position was
captured, as well as the focal length, date, time, weather and
lighting conditions of the photograph. A variety of control points
within the view were also accurately surveyed, in order to allow
the 3D data to be camera matched or keyed into each
photograph.
c) Image Processing
i. 
File conversion
1.1.11 
The camera outputs a ‘raw’ file format, which was processed
digitally to ensure colour accuracy. The final image was then
outputted as a standard compressed file-type (JPG).
ii. Image correction
1.1.12 
The compressed photographs were processed and stitched using
the package Hugin, which provides a suite of advanced features
and libraries for re-projecting and blending multiple source
images into panoramics with exposure, vignetting and white
balance correction. Despite the advances in digital photography
over the last 10 years, the circular nature of lenses results in a
small amount of distortion on the perimeter of images. Due to this,
the very outer edges of an image are often not taken into
consideration to minimise the risk of inaccuracy.
d) 3D model
i. 
3D model creation
1.1.13 
A three-dimensional computer model of the development and the
various assessment features was supplied by WSP, in house 
GIS teams and other designers.
 
ii. Scale, height & position check 
1.1.14 
Once received, the model was positioned using Architectural 
general arrangement drawings, OS site plans and surveyed level 
information. The surveyed control points were then brought into 
the model, in an easily visible contrasting colour. Virtual cameras 
of matching specifications to the recorded camera and lens used 
for each view were then placed within the scene at the correct 
surveyed location. The virtual 3D camera was then rotated to the 
correct position using the captured photography as a backplate. 
e) Rendering 
i. 
Sunlight & daylight 
1.1.15 
The VRaySun and VRaySky are special features within our 
rendering software which are provided as part of the Chaosgroup 
Vray renderer, utilised by AECOM. Developed to work together, 
the VRaySun and VRaySky reproduce the real-life Sun and Sky 
environment of the Earth. Both are programed so that they 
change their appearance depending on a number of factors, such 
as the direction of the VRaySun; which was dynamically linked 
and geo-referenced to the real world position of the site, the time, 
day and month. Different sky options were also chosen (clear, 
overcast, etc.) to match the digital photography. 
1.1.16 
Using this lighting system, alongside the physically accurate 
material properties, the software calculated the effects of the sun 
and sky conditions on the appearance of the proposed scheme, 
maximising fidelity of the illustrated structures. 
f) Post production 
i. 
Post production 
1.1.17 
Once the rendering stage was complete, the images were 
brought into Adobe Photoshop to superimpose the proposed 
development onto the digital images of the site. The foreground 
details such as trees, buildings or signage were then overlaid as 
masks; ensuring the depth of the various items was represented 
correctly. If required, the rendered image was then further edited 
to accurately match the colour, saturation and environmental 
effects shown in the photograph. This is a qualitative or subjective 
process, but effort is made to ensure it provides objectively 
accurate views of the Development as proposed. 
g) Review 
i. 
Review 
1.1.18 
A final qualitative check of all of the AVRs was carried out with 
other members of the project team to ensure that they provided 
objectively accurate views of the Project from the information 
provided.
