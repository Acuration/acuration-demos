Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a Phase 1 Habitat Survey of the Project Site (the 
‘Survey Site’). The purpose of the survey was to inform and support an application for Development 
Consent for the Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature review was also 
conducted, which covered the Project Site and land up to 5 km for statutory designated sites, and 2 
km for non-statutory designated sites from the Survey Site. 
1.3 
The desk study undertaken in support of this assessment identified the presence of seven 
nationally designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within a 5 km radius of the Survey 
Site. The closest of these is King’s Wood and Glebe Meadows, Houghton Conquest SSSI located 
approximately 1.1 km to the east of the Survey Site. This site comprises ash/maple woodland, and 
represents a habitat which has become increasingly scarce in Bedfordshire. Species-rich 
unimproved grassland and ponds are also present. In addition, there are six Local Nature Reserves 
(LNRs) within a 5 km radius of the Survey Site, four of which are also designated as SSSIs. The 
closest LNR, which is not also a SSSI is Flitwick Wood LNR located approximately 4.1 km to the 
south of the Survey Site. This site comprises an area of ancient woodland supporting a diverse 
botanical assemblage.  
1.4 
A total of 12 non-statutory designated CWSs are present within a 2 km radius of the Survey Site. 
The closest of these is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, which covers a proportion of the northern extremity 
of the Survey Site within the area also known as Rookery South Pit. The Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
consists of three large pools with associated reedbed, sparse ephemeral/short perennial vegetation 
and rank neutral grassland in the north-western corner. It is understood that habitats within 
Rookery South Pit (which occupies the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS) is currently the 
subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner.  Towards the end 
of 2014, the base of Rookery South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk 
movement of soils that are required for the LLRS. 
1.5 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey found the Survey Site to predominantly comprise intensively managed 
arable land. Other habitats present included plantation broadleaved and mixed woodland, scrub, 
neutral grassland, improved grassland, tall ruderal vegetation, ephemeral / short perennial 
vegetation, swamp, standing water (ponds), running water (ditches) and species-poor hedgerows. 
1.6 
There are several habitats across the Survey Site which may be considered to meet the criteria for 
being Habitats of Principal Importance (HPI) (s. 41; NERC Act 2006). These include all hedgerows 
within the Survey Site and the open mosaic habitats (on previously developed land) contained 
within the Rookery Clay Pit CWS.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
Area within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas which extend from 
The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre 
of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and 
Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site covers the red-line boundary of the Project Site as reported in the Project Scoping 
Report, as illustrated on Figure 2. The main habitats within the Survey Site are arable fields, 
delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the north, an area of land exists 
that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the 
landowner. At the time of survey, in spring and summer of 2014, this area included sparsely 
vegetated ground, swamp and bare earth. Towards the end of 2014, it is expected to comprise just 
bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are required for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and initial Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified 
the need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation 
value of the Project Site, including an update of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, conducted at an 
appropriate time of year. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology 
chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an integral part of the 
application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey were to: 
 
Identify and characterise any statutory and non-statutory sites within 5 km and 2 km radii from 
the Survey Site boundary, respectively. 
 
Identify whether any Habitats of Principal Importance (S. 41; NERC Act 2006) are present 
within the Survey Site, and if present, to describe their condition and coverage. 
2.7 
This report updates the preliminary Ecological Appraisal for the Survey Site (BSG Ecology, 2014) 
with the main focus being on the identification and characterisation of designated sites and 
description of habitats within the Survey Site. Recommendations for protected and otherwise 
notable species of animal were made in the preliminary Ecological Appraisal. Accordingly, separate 
(Phase 2) surveys have been completed, and reports produced for mammals, herpetofauna 
(reptiles and amphibians), breeding birds and invertebrates. These were conducted synchronous to 
the present Phase 1 Habitat Survey.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC). Information on 
statutory designated sites was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the 
Survey Site boundary, and information regarding non-statutory designated sites was requested 
covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary. 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
Habitats within the Survey Site were identified and described following standard Joint Nature 
Conservation Committee (JNCC) Phase 1 habitat survey methodology as detailed in the Phase 1 
Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). This uses a system of codes to describe different habitat 
types based on the dominant vegetation present, which are recorded through the preparation of 
habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this report follow The New Flora of British Isles 
(Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
An initial field survey to map and describe habitats was undertaken by Stephen Foot MCIEEM and 
Dr Jessica Frame MCIEEM on 25th February 2014, this was subsequently updated by Dr Jim 
Fairclough MCIEEM following several visits to the Survey Site in late spring and summer, the last 
of these visits being on 30 July 2014.  
3.4 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site. They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual. 
3.5 
During the survey the presence of any invasive species of plant (listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981, as amended) was recorded. 
Limitations to Methods 
3.6 
There are no limitations to the survey conducted. The initial survey was undertaken in February 
2014, which is outside the optimal period for Phase 1 Habitat Survey. However, the present survey 
was conducted across several survey visits during the optimal survey season (late spring and 
summer), providing confidence that any plants or habitats of conservation concern would have 
been identified.

Results and Interpretation 
Desk Study 
Statutory Designated Sites 
4.1 
There are seven nationally designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) located within 5 km 
of the Survey Site boundary. The closest of these is King’s Wood and Glebe Meadows, Houghton 
Conquest SSSI which covers an area of 36.10 ha and is located approximately 1.1 km to the east 
of the Survey Site. This site comprises ash/maple woodland, and represents a habitat which has 
become increasingly scarce in Bedfordshire. The wood is characteristic of ancient semi-natural 
woodland supporting a rich flora. Glebe Meadows border the woodland to the north and consist of 
species-rich unimproved grassland managed for hay and grazing. Small ponds supporting 
amphibians are also present on the site. 
4.2 
There are also six Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) within a 5 km radius of the Survey Site; four of 
which are also designated as SSSIs.  The closest LNR, which is not also a SSSI is Flitwick Wood 
LNR located approximately 4.1 km to the south of the Survey Site. This site comprises an area of 
ancient woodland supporting a diverse botanical assemblage. 
4.3 
All statutory designated sites present within a 5 km radius of the Survey Site are outlined in Table 1 
in Appendix 2, and locations of these are shown on Figures 1a and 1b (Appendix 1), based on data 
provided by the BRMC. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites 
4.4 
A total of 17 non-statutory designated County Wildlife Sites (CWSs) (including Cooper’s Hill CWS 
which overlaps with Cooper’s Hill SSSI) are present within a 2 km radius of the Survey Site. The 
closest of these is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, which covers a proportion of the northern part of the 
Survey Site. The pit consists of three large pools (one of which is in the process of being drained) 
with associated reedbed (swamp), marshy grassland, scrub and unimproved neutral grassland. A 
patchy mosaic of sparse ephemeral/short perennial vegetation and bare ground is also present 
throughout the site. A broadleaved plantation is present forming a band through the centre of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
4.5 
Two Roadside Nature Reserves (RNRs) are also present within the study area. Marston Bypass 
RNR, and Cooper’s Hill RNR. The closest of these is Marston Bypass RNR, which is located 
approximately 0.7 km to the west of the Survey Site and consists of a road verge sown with 
wildflower seeds. 
4.6 
The remaining sites are described in Table 2 in Appendix 2 with their locations shown in Figure 1b 
(produced and provided by the BRMC). Where there is overlap of a non-designated site with a 
statutory designated site (see above), the description for the statutory designated site takes 
precedence. A single Local Geological Site (LGS), Quest Pit LGS, which is not of nature 
conservation importance, lies approximately 1 km north east of the Survey Site. 
Habitats  
4.7 
The majority of the Survey Site comprised intensively managed agricultural land, characterised by 
large arable fields, grass-covered field margins and fairly recent, species-poor, yet intact 
hedgerows (dominated by hawthorn Crataegus monogyna). Occasional wooded plantations of 
fairly recent origin (less than 30 years old) were located across the Survey Site. To the north of the 
Survey Site is land within the Rookery Clay Pits CWS. The parts of the Survey Site within the CWS 
included an access track that was a mosaic of bare ground with ephemeral vegetation and scrub at 
varying density; and a large depression (the southern pit) that comprised a patchy mosaic of bare 
ground, ephemeral vegetation and swamp vegetation in the form of drying reedbed dominated by 
stunted common reed Phragmites australis. 
4.8 
The following broad habitat types were recorded within the Survey Site during the survey:

4.9 
The distribution of these habitats is shown on Figure 2 (Appendix 1) with summary descriptions 
given below. Dominant or characteristic flora is described, together with notes on the relative 
abundance of floral species within the context of each habitat parcel. Target Notes (TNs) referred 
to in the text below and on Figure 2 are provided in Appendix 3 with photographs provided in 
Appendix 4. 
Arable 
4.10 
The majority of the Survey Site comprised intensively managed arable farmland. Field margins 
were up to 4 m wide, but generally species poor and appeared to have been sown with grasses 
that permit infrequent vehicular access along the margins without ‘cutting up’ the ground. 
Photograph 1 shows a typical arable field margin, located on the eastern side of the railway. 
Plantation Woodland 
4.11 
There were a number of parcels of plantation woodland within the Survey Site. One of the larger 
and more structurally diverse parcels is located towards the north of the Survey Site adjacent to the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS (TN 1 & Photograph 2). This semi-mature plantation woodland contained a 
mix of deciduous and coniferous species, including alder Alnus glutinosa, pedunculate oak 
Quercus robur, ash Fraxinus excelsior, field maple Acer campstre and silver birch Betula pendula. 
The core of the woodland had a dense canopy and therefore a sparse shrub layer and ground 
flora. 
4.12 
Another area of plantation woodland, immediately south of South Pillinge Farm (TN 2) was also of 
note. This block of plantation woodland comprised broadleaved species and was also semi-mature. 
Planted poplar Populus sp. was abundant (locally dominant) within the canopy, and occasional 
Lombardy poplar Populus nigra “italica” lined the western edge, which is also delineated by a ditch 
and hedgerow with hawthorn and crack willow Salix fragilis. The shrub layer was relatively dense 
and included frequent hawthorn Crataegus monogyna with occasional field maple Acer campestre 
and wych elm Ulmus glabra. The ground flora of this woodland parcel, similar to others, was 
sparse. 
4.13 
Other parcels of plantation woodland had similar properties to those described, although 
plantations to the south and east of the Survey Site tended to be used for pheasant rearing, so had 
characteristically poor ground floras attributed to the foraging activity of game birds. One exception 
was an area of recently planted broadleaved woodland, at TN 3, between Millbrook Road and the 
railway line. The young trees are establishing on what is presently unimproved neutral grassland 
characterised by coarse grasses and common fleabane Pulicaria dysenterica. 
Scrub and Tall Ruderal Vegatation 
4.14 
Scattered scrub was represented across the Survey Site in varying amounts, especially in 
association with edges of plantation woodland (e.g. TNs 1, 2 and 3). More dense stands of 
continuous scrub were associated with the railway corridor running north-south, through the centre 
 
Millbrook Power Plant 
 
7 
02/12/2014 
of the Survey Site, and the sides of the access track to the north west (TN4). Hawthorn, blackthorn 
Prunus spinosa, elder Sambucus nigra and bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. were the main species 
that comprised the scrub habitat, although young silver birch and alder were locally abundant along 
the access track (Photograph 3). 
4.15 
Tall ruderal vegetation, including common nettle Urtica dioica, hogweed Heracleum sphondylium 
cleavers Galium aparine and tall willowherbs (e.g. great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and 
rosebay willowherb Chamerion angustifolium) were found in varying proportions with the scrub. 
The most extensive area of tall ruderal vegetation was on the edge of plantation woodland, 
bordering a large arable field to the far south west of the Survey Site. 
Neutral Grassland 
4.16 
The neutral grassland habitat category is generally reserved for areas of grassland that are barely 
managed (unimproved) or show a lack of intensive management (semi-improved) and are 
characterised by grassland vegetation of neutral soils. Such grasslands are often (but not always) 
relatively species-rich. The best example of neutral grassland in the Survey Site was that to the 
south east corner of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (see TN 5 and Photograph 4). This area was on 
raised ground (elevated above the pit), was species-rich and was being invaded by scrub. Typical 
species included agrimony Agrimonia eupatoria, bird’s-foot-trefoil Lotus corniculatus, St John’s-
wort’s Hypericum sp. and yellow oat-grass Trisetum flavescens. 
4.17 
Several arable field margins, particularly in the northern and western parts of the Survey Site (TN 8 
and Photograph 5), and along the railway corridor showed evidence of semi-improved and 
unimproved neutral grassland, and were of slightly greater value than their species-poor 
counterparts further east and south across the Survey Site. Typical species of these margins, 
which were between 1 to 2 m wide, were red fescue Festuca rubra, false oat-grass Arrhenatherum 
elatius, common fleabane, creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, wild carrot Daucus carota, 
bramble, cow parsley Anthriscus sylvestris, hogweed and great willowherb. 
4.18 
Two other prominent areas of neutral grassland included an area within the wooded glade to the 
west of the Survey Site (TN 2), and in association with the young broadleaved plantation adjacent 
to the railway and Millbrook Road (TN3). 
Improved Grassland 
4.19 
One area of improved grassland, characterised by rye-grass Lolium perenne, was located to the 
west of the Survey Site. This was a small sheep grazed pasture immediately south of South 
Pillinge Farm. 
Ephemeral / Short Perennial Vegetation 
4.20 
The access track in the north-west of the Survey Site (see TN4 and Photographs 3 and 6) included 
the most interesting areas of ephemeral vegetation within the Survey Site. An extensive range of 
plants associated with the track was found here, albeit as a mosaic with other habitat types (e.g. 
tall ruderal vegetation, scrub, neutral grassland, bare earth); especially at the far north, close to the 
gateway where the target note (TN 4) is positioned. 
4.21 
Other extensive areas of ephemeral vegetation were located around the south western part of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS, and extending into an arable field (dissected by a ditch) that had been set 
aside (see Photographs 7, 8 and 9). Here the ephemeral vegetation was characterised by bristly 
oxtongue 
Helminthotheca 
echioides, 
sow-thistles 
Sonchus 
sp., 
scentless 
mayweed 
Tripleurospermum inodorum, common fleabane and, in damper soils, encroaching wood small-reed 
Calamagrostis epijegos. 
Swamp (reedbed) 
4.22 
Part of the Survey Site (to the north) encroaches onto Rookery Clay Pit CWS, most notably the 
southern pit.  Here the vegetation comprised a patchy mosaic of bare ground, ephemeral 
vegetation and swamp vegetation in the form of drying reedbed dominated by stunted common 
reed Phragmites australis. This land is being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) by the landowner and is due to be completed by December 2014. The most extensive 
 
Millbrook Power Plant 
 
8 
02/12/2014 
areas of reedbed, dominated by healthier common reed, at a lower gradient were recognised as 
‘swamp’ under the Phase 1 Habitat classification, and other plants recorded here are provided at 
TN 6. 
Standing water  
4.23 
There were three ponds within the Survey Site (see TN 7 and Photograph 9). These are located to 
the east and are positioned centrally in arable fields. The ponds themselves were mature, yet still 
with plenty of open water and marginal vegetation. This included species such as reedmace Typha 
latifolia which was dominant in two of the ponds, and broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton 
natans, which was a dominant aquatic plant in one of the ponds. 
Running water 
4.24 
A network of wet and damp (seasonally wet) ditches was present across the Survey Site. The 
ditches had steep sided earth banks and were quite shallow, with water depths ranging between 
just a few cm to 50 cm in depth. Aquatic and marginal macrophytes were relatively limited largely 
because of the heavy shading to most of the ditches from hedgerows running parallel to the ditch, 
and also due to them becoming periodically dry in summer / early autumn. 
4.25 
The ditch described at TN 8, at the centre of the Survey Site (see Photograph 5), had the most 
interest, primarily due to the open aspect of the ditch, especially along the section that ran east – 
west. 
Species-poor hedgerows 
4.26 
The majority of hedgerows across the Survey Site were of a uniform structure, being intensively 
managed (approximately 2 m in height and 1.5 m in width); and species-poor, being dominated by 
hawthorn. Other woody plants were to be found in the hedgerows, although none were found 
frequently enough for any hedgerow to merit designation as ‘species-rich’, and as such, none are 
likely to meet the criteria required to be ‘Important’ under the Hedgerow Regulations, 1997. The 
occasionally occurring woody species included: blackthorn, field maple Acer campestre, willow 
Salix sp., English elm Ulmus procera, wild privet Ligustrum vulgare, ash, hazel, elder, dog rose, 
bramble and ivy Hedera helix. The ground flora associated with the hedgerows was limited to 
coarse grasses, cow parsley, cleavers, common nettle, ivy and lords and ladies Arum maculatum. 
4.27 
A small number of hedgerows, especially those near to TN 1 and TN 2 were unmanaged and were 
up to 3 m in height, although the composition of woody species remained similar. 
Other habitats 
4.28 
Other habitats of limited ecological significance within the Survey Site included hard-standing 
(roads, surfaced tracks and pedestrian access) and the railway line running north –south, that splits 
the Survey Site down the centre. 
Invasive, non-native species 
4.29 
New Zealand pigmyweed Crassula helmsii was the only invasive, non-native species listed on 
Schedule 9, Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) that was recorded 
during the survey. This was confined to the Rookery Clay Pits CWS (southern pit). 
Habitats of Principal Importance  
4.30 
There were several habitats across the Survey Site which may be considered in relation to whether 
they merited inclusion as Habitats of Principal Importance (HPI) (s. 41; NERC Act 2006). These are 
discussed below, with reference to the relevant habitat description, provided by JNCC (BRIG, 
2008). 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

02/12/2014 
Arable field margins 
4.31 
All field margins were established as grassland strips providing vehicular (4 x 4) access. None of 
these margins specifically provided benefits for wildlife, and as such are not considered to meet the 
requirements for this HPI. 
Hedgerows 
4.32 
All hedgerows mapped within the Survey Site were over 20 m long and predominantly comprise 
native plants. Accordingly, these are classified as HPIs. 
Ponds 
4.33 
On vegetative characteristics alone, the three ponds within the Survey Site do not merit 
classification as HPIs. This is on the basis that the ponds did not support a diverse plant 
community. 
Open mosaic habitats on previously developed land 
4.34 
Taken together, the habitats across the northern part of the Survey Site, which lie within the 
Rookery Clay Pits CWS, merit inclusion under this HPI. All of the following criteria are met: 
 
The area of open mosaic habitat is at least 0.25 ha in size. The area of land within the Survey 
Site that is within the CWS far exceeds this amount; 
 
There is a known history of disturbance at the site (notably clay extraction); 
 
The site contained some vegetation, in this case, ephemeral / short perennial, tall ruderal, 
scrub, neutral grassland and swamp habitat types; 
 
The site contained unvegetated, loose bare substrate and vegetated pools were present, 
principally in the southern pit; and 
 
The site showed spatial variation, forming a mosaic of one or more of the early successional 
communities, plus bare substrate, within 0.25 ha. The access road and southern pit all 
included mosaics of habitat, with bare substrate being a feature at both. 
Lowland mixed deciduous woodland 
4.35 
The areas of planted woodland across the Survey Site displayed some characteristics of the HPI; 
however, given their age and general structure (e.g. sparse ground flora and often managed 
through game keeping interests), it is unlikely that these woodlands can be classified as this priority 
habitat type. Despite this, the planted woodland blocks do have intrinsic value and are likely to 
provide habitat for a range of species.

Target Note 4 
The access track to the north of the Survey Site was formed of compacted soil, rubble & rail ballast 
that was exposed bare ground due to the frequency of vehicular movement along the track. Either 
side of the track was a mosaic of scrub, tall ruderal vegetation, short perennial / ephemeral 
vegetation and narrow fringes of rabbit grazed neutral grassland. It is understood from the 
landowner that this area is regularly sprayed with herbicide in order to keep vegetation under 
control in areas previously cleared of great crested newts. The more species-rich area of this 
habitat mosaic was located at the gateway / entrance to the far north of the Survey Site, and in the 
area marked by the Target Note.

dulcumara, branched bur-reed Sparganium erectum, reedmace Typha latifolia and soft rush 
Juncus effusus. One pond had a covering of broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton natans at the 
centre of the pond. 
Target Note 8 
A section of ditch, approximately 700 m long that runs from east to west and is mostly unshaded. 
Unlike other ditch sections across the Survey Site, this section had more gently sloping banks, 
dominated by coarse grasses with patches of blackthorn Prunus spinosa and hawthorn Crataegus 
monogyna scrub, and a varied assemblage of marginal plants, which included: abundant fool's 
watercress Apium nodiflorum, great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and water mint Mentha 
aquatica; with occasional meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria and false-fox sedge Carex otrubae.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake invertebrate surveys of suitable habitats within the 
red-line of the Project Site, as reported in the Project Scoping Report (the ‘Survey Site’). The 
purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature review was also conducted, which 
covered the Project Site and land up to 2 km from this point. 
1.3 
The desk study revealed the presence of a significant (county value) invertebrate fauna associated 
with The Rookery. It is understood that habitats within Rookery South Pit (which occupies the 
southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS) is currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner.  Towards the end of 2014, the base of Rookery 
South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are 
required for the LLRS. 
1.4 
A total of 271 species were recorded from the Survey Site. Many of the species recorded are 
common and widespread across England. However, three of these are nationally scarce and 
eleven of these are Species of Principal Importance, albeit only on account of their population 
declines over recent decades, which, according to the JNCC (2010) require further research.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
Area within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas which extend from 
The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre 
of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and 
Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site is restricted to the best examples of suitable habitat within the red-line boundary of 
the Project Site as reported in the Project Scoping Report (as determined by an experienced 
entomologist). The Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 Appendix 2. The main habitats within the 
Survey Site are arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the 
north, an area of land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. At the time of survey, in spring and summer of 
2014, this area included sparsely vegetated ground, swamp and bare earth. Towards the end of 
2014, it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are required 
for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including invertebrate surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the invertebrate survey were to identify whether any rare, scarce or nationally 
threatened species of invertebrate, including Species of Principal Importance were present, and if 
present, to evaluate their likely coverage across the Survey Site. 
2.7 
This report is an interim report. Further surveys are programmed for late August and early 
September 2014; targeting late summer terrestrial invertebrates (including moths and butterflies), 
and aquatic invertebrates of the three ponds in the Survey Site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected species was requested from the Bedfordshire 
and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering the Project Site and 
land up to 2 km from the Project Site boundary. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi 
Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and 
aerial photography of the area were also reviewed. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS), including land within and 
immediately north of the Survey Site (PBA, 2009). 
Habitat Potential Assessment 
3.3 
On 8 May 2014, the Survey Site (shown on Figure 1) was assessed by Dr Ian Fairclough MCIEEM, 
an experienced entomologist, for its suitability to support important invertebrate communities. 
3.4 
Notes were made of the habitats present, which were documented in a photographic record. 
Habitats were assessed for their potential to support important invertebrate communities.  To 
enable a full characterisation of the Survey Site for invertebrates this included observations of 
features that might limit invertebrate interest as well as those which might be of particular value for 
invertebrates. In particular, emphasis was placed on the following features (where present): 
 
Mature open grown trees and veteran trees: especially those with large volumes of standing 
dead wood; 
 
Woodland edge and scrub: especially where there is a diverse vegetation structure and 
species composition; 
 
Species-rich grassland: especially that in association with scrub, with a high proportion of 
plants providing nectar and pollen, and with a varied vegetation structure; 
 
Early successional habitat: (e.g. cliff faces, quarries, eroded banks, periodically disturbed bare 
or sparsely vegetated ground) especially on free-draining ground where there is a high 
proportion of exposed bare earth; and 
 
Wetland: including watercourses (e.g. ditches, flushes and seepages), standing water or 
waterbodies (e.g. ponds, lakes and swamp) and associated terrestrial habitat (e.g. wet heath 
and marshy grassland). 
3.5 
A number of habitats were identified during the survey with the potential to support important 
invertebrate communities (which are described further in the results section). Subsequent 
invertebrate surveys were designed, to target key indicator groups of invertebrates within the 
Survey Site, namely Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Coleoptera (beetles) and Hemiptera (true 
bugs), associated with ditches, forb-rich grassland, and grassland and scrub matrix assemblages. 
Three ponds that occur within the Survey Site were also surveyed to determine their importance to 
aquatic invertebrates. 
3.6 
The results of these targeted surveys were used to assess the main groups of invertebrate present 
within the Survey Site, and to provide an indication of the relative species diversity within the 
targeted groups. 
Targeted Survey for Terrestrial Invertebrates (non-Lepidoptera) 
3.7 
Features within the Survey Site that provided the most suitable habitat for these taxonomic orders 
were selected for targeted survey.  These included a range of typical, yet more suitable vegetation 
structures, including: transitional habitat along well established field margins close to ditch margins 
and hedgerows. Across these, the following sampling methods were employed: pitfall traps, sweep 
netting, beating and grubbing. These methods are described below. Whilst Coleoptera and 
Hemiptera formed the focus of the survey, incidental records of other invertebrate taxa were also 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

recorded. Surveys were conducted on 9 and 20 May, 22 August and 3 September 2014 by Dr Ian 
Fairclough. 
Pitfall Traps 
3.8 
Pitfall traps were set out in clusters of three, at two locations within the Survey Site (shown on 
Figure 1). Pitfall trapping involved the use of circular plant pot trays (24 cm diameter x 5 cm depth) 
that were sunk into a circular hole that was excavated using a spade.  The trays were installed 
such that the tray rims were flush with the surrounding ground level.  Preserving fluid, comprising 1 
part ethylene glycol (antifreeze) to 3 parts water, was poured into the trays until they were half full.  
A drop of detergent was added to the fluid to break the surface tension and lastly, a layer of mesh 
(aperture size 2 cm x 1 cm) was balanced over the tray to prevent capture of small mammals, 
amphibians and reptiles.  Photograph 1 (Appendix 1) shows a pitfall trap deployed within the 
Survey Site. The traps were operational in late spring during the period from 9 and 20 May 2014, 
and again in late summer during the period 22 August and 3 September 2014. Pitfall trapping is 
considered to be an effective method for the sampling of ground dwelling beetles, particularly those 
belonging to the family Carabidae (ground beetles). 
Sweep Netting 
3.9 
Sweep netting involved walking at a steady pace through the vegetation and passing an 
entomologist’s sweep net back and forth through vegetation in a figure of eight motion. This 
method is particularly suitable for capturing phytophagous (foliage-feeding) families such as 
Curculionidae (weevils), Chrysomelidae (leaf or flea beetles), Nitidulidae (pollen beetles) and 
Cantharidae (soldier beetles). Sweep netting is also an effective method for collecting many 
families of bugs, although the Miridae (capsid bugs) can often be the most numerous both in 
number of individuals and number of species. 
Beating 
3.10 
Beating is a useful technique for extracting beetles from overhanging branches. This method 
involves placing a beating tray beneath a branch before delivering several sharp blows to the 
branch and sending any dislodged invertebrates into the beating tray for inspection. This method 
may uncover a diverse array of beetle families (similar to those found during the sweeping), and 
occasionally producing a Cerambycid (longhorn beetle) or Elaterid (click beetle). The Pentatomidae 
and Acanthosomatidae (shield bugs) are two of many Hemipteran families recorded using this 
method. 
Grubbing 
3.11 
Grubbing is the name generally applied to the extraction of invertebrates by hand from a variety of 
mediums such as denser grass tussocks, where a thatch has developed, often with patches of 
pleurocarpous (spreading and branched) mosses. To assist in the detection of small beetles (e.g. 
Staphylinidae (rove beetles)), moss and leaf litter were sieved or placed in a bucket of water to 
capture invertebrates struggling to the surface. 
Weather Conditions 
Late spring 
3.12 
For both survey visits the weather had been warm if slightly unsettled in the preceding weeks. On 
the day of the survey conducted on 9 May 2014, the weather was dry, cloudy and warm (maximum 
temperature 20°C), with a light wind. During the survey visit undertaken on 20 May 2014 the 
weather was dry, fairly hot (maximum temperature 23°C) and overcast with occasional sunny 
spells, with a light wind. The weather conditions were optimal for both surveys. 
Late summer 
3.13 
The weather conditions in 2014 deteriorated considerably in August, which meant that the earliest 
date during which to conduct the surveys was towards the end of the month, when conditions 
showed signs of recovery. For both survey visits the weather had been wet and mild the preceding 
weeks. On the day of the survey conducted on 22 August 2014, the weather was dry, cloudy and 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

02/12/2014 
fairly warm (maximum temperature 18°C), with light to moderate wind. During the survey visit 
undertaken on 3 September 2014 the weather was dry, warm (maximum temperature 22°C) and 
overcast with occasional sunny spells (especially in the afternoon), with a light to moderate wind. 
The weather conditions were optimal for both surveys. 
Sample Sorting and Identification 
3.14 
Whilst some species could be identified in the field, the majority of specimens were stored in 70% 
methanol solution for later identification, using a stereoscopic microscope with the aid of 
identification literature. Experienced entomologist, Don Stenhouse FRES, assisted in the 
identification of terrestrial invertebrates collected from the field. 
Targeted Survey for Butterflies 
3.15 
On 30 July 2014 and 3 September 2014, Dr Jim Fairclough visited the Survey Site to conduct a 
walked butterfly transect survey. 
3.16 
A transect route was selected that covered a large proportion of the typical habitats of the whole of 
the Survey Site (encompassing the more suitable areas for butterflies) and took approximately two 
and a half hours to complete. This transect route is shown on Figure 1. The method used an 
adapted protocol for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Thus: 
 
Timed counts were made between 10:00 and 16:30 hours, and only carried out in warm, bright 
and dry weather, with no more than moderate winds. 
 
A transect route was devised (Figure 1), which was split into sections, each section being of 
similar length and covering habitat typical of the Survey Site. 
 
Each section was walked at a slow, steady pace counting all butterflies seen within a fixed 
distance, 2.5 m either side of the transect line and 5 m ahead. 
 
Care was taken to maintain a steady pace and avoid waiting at favoured hotspots to improve 
the count and bias the results. 
 
Butterfly numbers and % sunshine in each section were recorded using the standard UKBMS 
proforma. Wind speed was estimated using the Beaufort scale (0 - no wind, 6 - very strong 
wind). 
3.17 
During the July survey the wind speed was measured as 2 (light wind – wind felt on face) and the 
average temperature was 25°C. 
3.18 
During the September survey the wind speed was measured as 3 (light / moderate wind – leaves in 
slight motion) and the average temperature was 21°C. 
Targeted Survey for Moths 
3.19 
On 18 June 2014, and 22 August 2014, a night-time moth survey was undertaken. The June 
survey was conducted by Peter Newbold MCIEEM and Ross Crates MCIEEM, and the August 
survey was conducted by Dr Jim Fairclough MCIEEM and Ross Crates MCIEEM; all ecologists 
competent in moth surveys and identification. On each of the two survey events two Robinson 
moth traps were used, each fitted with mercury vapour bulbs to attract as many moths as possible. 
The traps were positioned in areas within the Survey Site that were expected to give the greatest 
range of species, yet in locations that were typical of the types of habitat prevailing at the Survey 
Site (notably field margins close to hedgerows and ditches) (see Figure 1 for trap locations). 
3.20 
Weather conditions during the June survey were optimal; warm and humid (overnight low of 16°C) 
and with little or no wind. During the August survey the conditions were within acceptable limits, 
with an overnight low of 120C and a light wind. 
3.21 
For each survey event the lights were switched on at dusk and remained lit until the generator 
powered down after at least four hours running time. The traps were checked periodically 
throughout the night to log any new arrivals. Any species hard to identify from external markings 
alone, and those requiring further confirmation, were retained and dissected if necessary to 
ascertain their identity.

Targeted Survey for Aquatic Invertebrates 
3.22 
The aquatic invertebrate survey focussed on the three ponds present within the site. Ponds Q, R 
and T were surveyed. The survey was undertaken on 22 August 2014 by Dr Jim Fairclough 
MCIEEM, a skilled freshwater ecologist, with assistance from Ross Crates MCIEEM.  
3.23 
Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at the three ponds using standard 3-minute kick sample 
methodology (Biggs et al., 1998) using a 1 mm mesh hand net. One minute of hand searching (of 
rocks, logs, leaf packs and other submerged debris) was then carried out in search of invertebrates 
(e.g. caddis larvae, pond skaters and whirligig beetles) that might otherwise have be missed during 
the net sampling.   
3.24 
Invertebrates were separated from detritus and bed material in the field and preserved immediately 
in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirit (IMS) for subsequent laboratory analysis. 
3.25 
The weather during the survey was fairly warm (18°C) and dry, with a light wind. The location of 
each of the ponds surveyed is shown in Figure 1. 
Laboratory Identification 
3.26 
All aquatic macroinvertebrate individuals (excluding fly larvae and worms) collected in the field 
were identified to species-level under a stereoscopic microscope (up to 70x magnification) using 
the most up-to-date identification keys available. Identification of aquatic macroinvertebrates was 
completed by Dr Jessica Frame of BSG Ecology who is an experienced freshwater ecologist with a 
PhD in freshwater ecology. 
Survey Limitations 
3.27 
Seasonal surveys such as those carried out at the Survey Site are liable to be biased, to some 
extent, by the life histories of the invertebrate species themselves, a proportion of which may be 
found in spring, or in autumn, for example. The prevailing state of the vegetation will also play an 
important role. In the present case, much of the determination of interest depends on the quality of 
established field margin habitat, either specifically or as part of a wider mosaic with other boundary 
features, and the appearance and apparent value of vegetation can vary over the course of a year, 
as different plant species grow and come into flower, and as the exact nature of management, and 
its consequences for invertebrates, become apparent. For example, it is unlikely that identical 
conclusions may have been drawn from a survey conducted in early-spring, or early-autumn. 
3.28 
Allied to this, two or three visits targeting two or three insect orders can only detect a proportion of 
the total species pool using a site. However, it does provide the opportunity to investigate the 
assemblage types present and to gauge where the most important parts of the Survey Site for 
invertebrates are most likely to be found. Furthermore, the setting of pitfall traps, to some extent, 
helps negate restricted survey effort (especially for ground dwelling invertebrates), since the traps 
are operational and collecting target groups over a prolonged period of time.

Results and Interpretation 
Desk Study 
4.1 
An invertebrate scoping survey followed by nine site visits to collect invertebrates was undertaken 
by BSG Ecology during 2008 (PBA, 2009). This suite of surveys identified 483 species of 
invertebrates within Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS), some of which were of 
conservation importance. The Rookery Clay Pits CWS includes the southern clay pit of The 
Rookery, which falls within the Survey Site. Three species were classified as SPIs (Species of 
Principal Importance, NERC Act 2006); the small heath Coenonympha pamphilus, shaded broad-
bar moth Scotopteryx chenopodiata and cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae. All three are still 
widespread and common though declining. Amongst the 483 species recorded, 44 hold a Red Data 
Book or Nationally Scarce conservation status or merit one. The survey revealed Rookery Pits 
CWS as a site of county importance for invertebrate conservation and one of the best invertebrate 
sites in Bedfordshire. Most of the areas and habitat components sampled by the survey yielded 
Red Data Book or Nationally Scarce invertebrates. Aquatic and wetland habitats were richest in 
Red Data Book or Nationally Scarce invertebrate species but many species were associated with 
the grassland habitats and the bare and sparsely-vegetated ground, and some with a stand of 
poplars. 
4.2 
The desk study produced records of eighteen species of butterfly, all from within or adjacent to the 
Survey Site. These included the small heath, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, the wall Lasiommata 
megera and the grizzled skipper Pyrgus malvae, all of which are classified as SPI’s. In addition, 
records of 40 species of moth were obtained. The majority of these species were either recorded 
on site or within a 200 m radius of the Survey Site. Most of these species of moth are classified as 
SPIs. 
4.3 
All species of invertebrate recorded from the Survey Site that are of conservation significance (i.e. 
rare, scarce or nationally threatened species of invertebrate, including Species of Principal 
Importance) are listed in Appendix 3. 
Habitat Potential Assessment 
4.4 
The majority of the Survey Site comprised intensively managed agricultural land, characterised by 
large arable fields, grass-covered field margins and fairly recent, species-poor, yet intact 
hedgerows (dominated by hawthorn Crataegus monogyna) (see Photograph 2, Appendix 1). These 
were discounted from further study on the basis of the habitat being of poor suitability for 
invertebrates. Only common and widespread species might be expected to occur in association 
with such habitat. 
4.5 
The main exception to this agricultural land is the area that lies to the north of the Survey Site. This 
comprised the access track that was a mosaic of bare ground with ephemeral vegetation and scrub 
at varying density. Also to the north, within Rookery South Pit was a patchy mosaic of bare ground, 
ephemeral vegetation and swamp vegetation in the form of drying reedbed dominated by stunted 
common reed Phragmites australis. These areas north of the Survey Site, notably within Rookery 
South Pit are being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. 
Accordingly, despite these areas maintaining a high level of interest for invertebrates at the time of 
survey, they were discounted from further investigation for the present study as it was assumed 
that the baseline for this area will be set as the future baseline (at the end of 2014), which is likely 
to a remodelled landform of compacted bare earth.

Notwithstanding the above, there were several habitat types of potential interest to invertebrates 
within the Survey Site. These formed the focus of the surveys and are summarised below. 
Established Boundary Features 
4.7 
As mentioned earlier, the hedgerows, which were more numerous in the east of the Survey Site, 
were of a uniform structure, species-poor and therefore lacking any defining character that would 
make them of significant value to invertebrates. The margins were generally species-poor, being 
dominated by grasses and lacking in forbs. However, there were several field boundaries,

particularly in the northern and western parts of the Survey Site, which are of slightly greater value 
(see Photographs 3, 4 and 5). In most cases, these included hedgerows and / or ditch banks with 
south-facing aspects and a wider variety of forbs, including species that are good pollen and nectar 
sources such as common fleabane Pulicaria dysenterica, wild carrot Daucus carota, bramble 
Rubus fruticosa agg, hogweed Heracleum sphondylium and great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum. 
Hedgerows at these locations were generally more complex and well-structured providing a 
permanent feature for hibernating invertebrates. Furthermore, they would have broken up the fields 
to add additional heterogeneity, and potentially warmth, at least close to the ground, which would 
likely to have been of particular benefit to butterflies. The ditches also contributed to the diversity of 
microhabitats for invertebrates, offering a more humid environment at the ditch bases, for ground 
beetles and rove beetles and, supporting a different assemblage of plants (e.g. watercress Rorippa 
nasturtium-aquaticum, water mint Mentha aquatica and meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria), which 
in turn can support a wider range of phytophagous (foliage feeding) invertebrates, such as weevils 
and various true bugs. 
Wooded Copses (Plantations) 
4.8 
There were several wooded copses across the Survey Site. Some were very recent, so were 
established on grassland habitat which was still prevalent. Others were somewhat older, yet still 
betrayed their origin as plantation woodland, due to a typically shaded and poorly developed 
ground flora and understorey, and a single age structure of trees. Pheasant were reared in some, 
which can also be detrimental to invertebrates as the pheasants will scour the ground feeding on 
ground dwelling invertebrates and nipping at young vegetation, stunting its growth. Copses fitting 
these descriptions would generally be of limited importance for terrestrial invertebrates. They have 
no features of antiquity such as a large volume of standing and fallen dead wood, rot holes, sap 
runs and cavities that would attract a more specialised dead wood (saproxylic) invertebrate fauna. 
4.9 
However, the most established copses within the Survey Site such as that immediately south of 
South Pillinge Farm (close to Butterfly Transect BT8, see Figure 1) could be expected to act as 
reservoirs, supporting more invertebrates than would be found in the wider intensively farmed 
landscape. Here the woodland was complemented with grassland where a ride cut through the 
woodland, and patches of ruderal vegetation (including nettle, thistles and umbellifers) provided 
transition zones that would often be rich in invertebrates, due to the structural diversity. The added 
height and often permanency of these features makes them important refuges for invertebrates 
especially during winter when penetrating frosts may otherwise have adverse consequences. The 
scrub which was also prevalent in this area would have been an important food source. In early 
and mid-spring, blackthorn and hawthorn are valuable reservoirs of nectar and pollen for bees, 
wasps, moths and beetles. Later in summer / early autumn they provide a source of food (fruit) for 
fruit feeding species. 
Ponds 
4.10 
There were three ponds within the Survey Site (see, for example, Photograph 6). These were 
located to the east and were positioned centrally in arable fields. Whilst being quite isolated, these 
ponds are still likely to have been important reservoirs for invertebrates. The wide field margins 
surrounding the ponds offered a buffer to the drift of chemicals used by the farmer, and the ponds 
themselves were mature, yet still with plenty of open water and marginal vegetation. This included 
species such as amphibious bistort Persicaria amphibia, bittersweet Solanum dulcumara, 
reedmace Typha latifolia and soft rush Juncus effusus. The range of species potentially associated 
with ponds is unequalled, with such habitat typically well represented by a range of snails, diving 
beetles (Dytiscidae), water beetles (Hydrophilidae), dragonflies (Odonata) and caddisflies 
(Trichoptera). 
Terrestrial Invertebrates (non-Lepidoptera) 
4.11 
In total 135 invertebrate taxa were identified to species level. Beetles made up most of the records 
(89 species). The next most recorded order was the true bugs followed by the bees, wasps and 
ants (Hymenoptera). The full list of invertebrates recorded within the Survey Site is displayed in

tabular format in Appendix 4.  The results of the survey were analysed by measuring the number of 
locally rare, nationally notable and IUCN red-list / RDB1 species. 
4.12 
Overall, the majority of the insects recorded are widely distributed and common, with 27 regarded 
as more local and three of Notable status. These notable species are discussed further in Table 1, 
below.

a field boundary (close to a ditch) to the north.

It has been recorded from roadside verges, field margins, 
grassland and disturbed ground. According to Morris 
(2008) it is ‘Notable B (hardly reflecting its rarity)’ 
suggesting that he regards it as rarer, although as it is 
found on the very common yarrow Achillea millefolium it 
could be expected to be more common. It was taken 
during sweeping of field margin vegetation to the north of 
the Survey Site (sweep net area 1; Figure 1).

1 Status Definitions and Criteria of Invertebrate Groups:  for many invertebrate groups, species rarity has often been gauged by the 
number of national 10km grid squares in which they occur.  The fewer the “spots on a map”, the rarer it is.  This, however, does not 
exactly equate with how threatened a species is, since some species may be naturally confined to very few localities but are very 
abundant where they do occur and under no immediate threat of extinction.  The matter of how threatened the “rarest” species are has 
been addressed in a series of Red Data Books (RDB), such as for insects (Shirt, 1987).  Here, the listing as RDB1 (Endangered), RDB2 
(Vulnerable) and RDB3 (Rare) is an assessment of how threatened or endangered the species is in Britain, rather than how scarce it is 
in terms of map spot counting. 
Over the last decade the RDB categories are slowly being replaced by IUCN red-list categories (Critically Endangered, Endangered and 
Vulnerable), which use different criteria to those developed for the RDBs. However, this process is slow, and IUCN categories are not 
available for all groups. Accordingly, wherever IUCN categories have been allocated, these are also shown. 
Below RDB status, less rare but still significant species can be defined as Nationally Scarce (formerly called Nationally Notable), which 
is often sub-divided into Na (scarce), Nb (less scarce). These sub-categories are based on 10 kilometre square spot counting for the 
Great Britain grid system.  The Na sub-category represents scarce taxa that are thought to occur in 30 or fewer 10 km squares of the 
Great Britain grid system.  The Nb sub-category represents less scarce taxa that occur in 31 to 100 10 km squares.  Taxa in the N- sub-
category are those listed as ‘Notable’, but not always distinguished into sub-category Na or Nb in the relevant review. These species are 
thought to occur in 16 to 100 10 km squares of the National Grid but are too poorly known for their status to be more precisely 
estimated. 
The concept of ‘Local’ is less well defined, but comprises species of distinctly limited or restricted distribution, with such limitations being 
brought about by climate controls, dependency on a scarce habitat type, host (in the case of parasitic species) or similar ecological 
factor.  In this present study, the Local status of species is as per the Recorder database package developed by JNCC.

The diversity of butterfly species is typical for a site of this type and location. The species recorded 
are generally considered to be common and widespread across central and southern England. 
4.15 
The most notable species recorded during the two surveys were as follows: 
 
The shaded broad-bar is a geometrid moth that occupies a wide range of habitats including 
dunes, downs, waste ground and grassland. The larvae feed on vetches and clovers. Whilst 
this is regarded as a widespread and moderately common species, it’s inclusion on Section 41 
of the NERC Act 2006 relates to a reported decline of 73% over 35 years for this species, 
which is triggering the need for further research into its decline (JNCC, 2010).

 
Small heath is a butterfly that typically occurs in well-drained grassland habitats where it lays 
its eggs on fine grasses such as fescues Festuca spp., meadow grasses Poa spp. and bents 
Agrostis spp. Despite being a fairly widespread species, the small heath is listed on Section 41 
of the NERC Act 2006, and is regarded by Butterfly Conservation (Fox et al., 2010) as being in 
the Near Threatened category, which reflects its decline in the British countryside over recent 
decades. 
Moths 
4.16 
The night-time surveys produced 104 taxa of moth, 103 of which were recognisable as species 
(see Appendix 4). 
4.17 
Nine species collected were particularly noteworthy, due to their status either as a nationally 
notable species, or their inclusion as a SPI (S. 41; NERC Act 2006). Table 3, below gives more 
detailed information about each species and their habitat requirements.

A description of each of the ponds surveyed is provided in Table 4 below and photographs of the 
ponds are provided in Appendix 1. 
Table 4: Pond Habitat Descriptions. 
Pond Ref. 
Pond Description 
Q 
This pond covered an area of approximately 70 m2 with a depth exceeding 1 m. 
The aquatic plant community in this pond included abundant common bulrush 
Typha latifolia and branched bur-reed Sparganium erectum, with a floating mat of 
common duckweed Lemna minor and ivy-leaved duckweed Lemna trisulca. 
R 
This pond covered an area of approximately 170 m2 with a depth of approximately 
1 m. The central section of the pond was heavily shaded by scrub. Marginal 
vegetation included abundant branched bur-reed and great willowherb Epilobium 
hirsutum. 
T 
This pond covered an area of approximately 160 m2 with a depth exceeding 1 m. 
The aquatic plant community in this pond was dominated by branched bur-reed 
around the margins, and broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton natans creating a 
floating carpet across the central part of the pond. Fish (stickleback) were 
numerous. 
 
   
4.19 
51 taxa were recorded across all three ponds. Pond Q supported the highest diversity of aquatic 
macroinvertebrates, with total of 42 taxa recorded.  Ponds R and T supported fewer taxa (19 and 
16 respectively). The samples were generally dominated by beetles (25 unique taxa), 23 of which 
were in Pond Q. No scarce or threatened aquatic invertebrates were identified within the samples. 
A complete list of all the macroinvertebrate taxa recorded from the ponds can be found in Appendix 
4.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake great crested newt Triturus cristatus (GCN) 
surveys, of ponds within the red-line boundary of the Project Site (as reported in the Project 
Scoping Report), and to a distance of up to 250 m from this (the ‘Survey Site’).  The Survey Site for 
the reptile surveys comprised suitable habitat within the Project Site. The purpose of the surveys 
was to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. 
A supporting desk study and literature review was also conducted, which covered the Project Site 
and land up to 2 km from this. 
Great Crested Newts 
1.3 
The desk study revealed the presence of a large population of GCN associated with Rookery North 
Pit. This population is formed from GCN that are being translocated from Rookery South Pit, which 
is currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner, 
under licence to Natural England. It is understood that the translocation of GCN from Rookery 
South Pit will be completed in 2014. 
1.4 
Thirteen ponds were surveyed in total as part of the field survey. These excluded the ponds in 
Rookery North Pit, for which current data exists confirming a large population in this area. The 
survey revealed the presence of GCN in eight of 13 ponds surveyed. These are represented by 
four separate populations, all with medium or small populations, which are broadly located in the 
east, south and west of the Survey Site.  
Reptiles 
1.5 
The desk study revealed the presence of a low population of grass snakes Natrix natrix and a 
medium population of common lizards Zootoca vivipara associated with The Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS. Reptiles are being translocated from Rookery South Pit, which is currently the subject of an 
ongoing LLRS. Again, it is understood that the translocation of reptiles from Rookery South Pit will 
be completed in 2014.

Surveys identified the presence of common lizard Zootoca vivipara and grass snake Natrix natrix 
within the Project Site, specifically along the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor and land to the 
west of this. Peak adult counts of common lizard and grass snake were eight and three 
respectively.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
Area within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas which extend from 
The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre 
of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and 
Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site includes all ponds (water bodies) within the red-line of the Project Site, as reported 
in the Project Scoping Report and to a distance of 250 m from this, as shown on Figure 1, 
Appendix 1.  The Survey Site for the reptile surveys includes representative areas of habitat with 
suitability for reptiles within the Project Site, as shown on Figure 3. The main habitats within the 
Survey Site are arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads and lanes. To the 
north, an area of land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. At the time of survey, in spring and summer of 
2014, this area included sparsely vegetated ground, swamp and bare earth. Towards the end of 
2014, it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are required 
for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including GCN and reptile surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in 
an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of surveys were to identify whether:  
 
Great crested newts (GCNs) were present in the ponds within the Survey Site, and if present, 
to estimate the population size; and  
 
Reptiles were present in suitable habitats within the Survey Site, and if present, to identify the 
species assemblage.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected species was requested from the Bedfordshire 
and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering the Survey Site and 
land up to 2 km away. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic 
Information for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the 
area were also reviewed. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, including land within and immediately north of the Survey 
Site (PBA, 2009; BSG Ecology, 2013). 
Great Crested Newt 
The Survey Site 
3.3 
The Survey Site includes all ponds within the red-line boundary of the Project Site, as reported in 
the Project Scoping Report, and to a distance of 250 m from this, which is shown on Figure 1. 
Guidance from Natural England (derived from the most recent Method Statement spreadsheet; 
Natural England, 2013) states that a 500 m search radius can be required in certain circumstances, 
which is normally when all the following conditions are met: 
a. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population, 
b. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority 
available locally, 
c. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
d. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
3.4 
In considering these conditions, it can be concluded that a 250 m search radius from the Project 
Site is appropriate, since not all the conditions are met, as described below. 
a. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population. This condition is met as a large population is 
present at Rookery North Pit (Section 4.0 provides further details). 
b. 
the footprint [Project Site] contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the 
majority available locally. The Project Site largely comprises intensively managed arable fields 
of low suitability to GCN. To the north (within Rookery South Pit) the Project Site includes land 
that is presently being restored as part of a LLRS. On completion of the restoration this land 
will be of low suitability for GCN. Outside the Project Site, particularly to the west, there are 
significant areas of semi-natural habitat that constitute excellent habitat for GCN. This includes 
habitat at the Vehicle Proving Ground, along the railway embankments / cuttings, and the 
Marston Vale Millennium Country Park. Accordingly, this condition is not met, and therefore no 
further consideration to the remaining two conditions is relevant. 
3.5 
In consideration of the Survey Site and the selection of ponds to a 250 m radius from the Project 
Site, it is also relevant to note that there are many suitable ponds in the surrounding landscape (up 
to 250 m from the Project Site) yet very few beyond this, therefore suggesting a lack of connectivity 
between such ponds (clustering) and limited opportunities for associated dispersal of GCN into the 
wider landscape. 
3.6 
In connection with the above point, where pond clustering occurs whereby a pond inside the 250 m 
radius from the Project Site is less than 250 m from a pond outwith the Project Site, the Survey Site 
has been extended to include this outer pond. This approach accords with the guidelines, and 
enables a full representation of the population size to be made, on the basis that GCN are 
assumed to readily move between ponds at this distance apart (English Nature, 2001).

Field Survey 
Habitat Suitability Assessment 
3.7 
During the field survey a HSI assessment of all ponds within the Survey Site was undertaken. 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a GCN HSI score to be derived for each pond by applying the scoring system developed by 
Oldham et al. in 2000 and updated by the Herpetological Conservation Trust in 2008 (HCT, 2008). 
The Habitat Suitability Index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each 
pond; these include size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are then 
used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the 
least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in one 
of five pre-defined categories defining its suitability for GCN as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8 
 
= excellent 
Amphibian Survey 
3.8 
Surveys were undertaken in accordance with survey techniques described in the Great Crested 
Newt Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001). Observations of GCN and other amphibian 
species of principal importance (S. 41; NERC Act 2006) were recorded. Three survey methods 
were employed on each of the 13 ponds during each survey, in accordance with standard 
methodology. These were a combination of bottle trapping, netting, torch light searches and/or egg 
searches, which are further described below. 
3.9 
Torch surveys: This method involved searching for GCN after sunset using 1 million candle power 
torches.  All accessible parts of a pond were slowly walked and searched.   
3.10 
Bottle trapping: Where water depth and bank side access allowed, bottle traps (constructed from 2 
litre plastic drinks bottles) were set in suitable parts of a pond at dusk and left in place overnight.  
Bottle traps were checked for amphibians the following morning within 12 hours of setting and any 
animals caught were released at the point of capture.   
3.11 
Netting: A long-handled dip-net was used for sampling suitable parts of a pond for amphibians.  
Where access permitted, all suitable parts of the pond were searched for GCN.  Results from 
netting are only useful for indicating presence/likely absence, and not population size. 
3.12 
Egg search: Egg searches were conducted in order to determine whether GCN were breeding in 
the ponds.  This involved searching marginal and aquatic vegetation for the distinctive leaf folding 
pattern and egg of GCN. Results from egg searches are only useful for indicating presence/likely 
absence, and not population size. The presence of GCN eggs is also a measure of attempted 
breeding at a pond. 
Great Crested Newt Population Assessment Survey 
3.13 
In order to estimate the population size class for ponds containing GCN, the peak adult count per 
pond per visit recorded through either torching or bottle-trapping must be determined. Where ponds 
supporting GCN occur within 250 m of each other, and are not separated by a significant barrier to 
dispersal, the population size class is indicated by the peak adult count summed across all 
connected ponds on a single survey visit through either torching or bottle-trapping. Populations can 
then be classed as: 
 
‘small’ for maximum counts of up to 10 adults; 
 
‘medium’ for maximum counts between 11 and 100; or 
 
‘large’ for maximum counts exceeding 100 adults.

Amphibian Survey Details 
3.14 
The surveys were conducted over a period of approximately eight weeks with four visits undertaken 
in the period mid-April to mid-May. They were conducted by Dr Jim Fairclough (JF) MCIEEM (GCN 
Licence Number: CLS001611), Peter Newbold (PN) MCIEEM (GCN Licence Number: 
CLS001717), Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, Dr Angie Julian (AJ) (GCN Licence Number: 
CLS02421), John Woods (JW) GradCIEEM, Elly Pattullo (EP), Ross Crates (RC), Francesca 
Morini (FM), Tom Chapman (TM) and Klare Chamberlain (KC).  Table 1, below, summarises the

Limitations of Study 
3.15 
No survey of Pond J was undertaken during visit 1 due to access restrictions. Given that three (of 
five) surveys of Pond J were undertaken during the period mid-April to mid-May, the period within 
which GCN counts are expected to peak, and in accordance with the Great Crested Newt 
Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001), the population size-class assessment based on the 
survey results of Pond J is considered to be robust. Furthermore, the peak GCN count in Pond J 
was 28 adults (visit 4). An additional survey would have been highly unlikely to identify a large 
population size-class (GCN count exceeding 100). 
Reptiles 
Field Survey 
3.16 
The reptile survey was undertaken in accordance with good practice guidance, including that set 
out in the Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent et al., 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance 
(Froglife, 1999). 
3.17 
The presence/likely absence of reptiles at the Survey Site was established through the use of 
artificial refugia in combination with a visual search of the Survey Site, as described below. 
Artificial Refugia 
3.18 
Artificial refugia (roofing felt or corrugated metal sheets measuring c. 0.5 m x 0.5 m or c. 0.5 m x 
1.0 m) were placed in locations assessed during the Phase 1 Habitat survey as being suitable for 
use by basking reptiles. Refugia were placed in a variety of aspects to enable survey findings to be 
indicative of use of the Survey Site by reptiles at different times of day, but where possible, 
favouring southerly aspects that would remain warm all day. 
3.19 
Suitable habitat for reptiles within the Survey Site is limited to a network of hedgerows and ditches, 
rough grassland, tall ruderal vegetation, patchy scrub and woodland edges. This was calculated to 
be approximately 20 ha in total. Accordingly, a total of 200 refugia were deployed: 180 on 17th April 
2014, 13 days ahead of the first survey visit; and an additional 20 on 30th May, incorporated into 
the survey from visit 4 onwards to reflect revisions to the Survey Site boundary. The average 
refugia density in areas of suitable reptile habitat was approximately 10 per hectare. This accords 
with the best practice recommended refugia density of 5-10 refugia per hectare (Froglife, 1999), 
enabling a robust assessment of the presence/likely absence of reptiles and an approximate 
estimate of the population size to be made. 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

3.20 
During each survey visit, the refugia were inspected for any reptiles basking on the upper surface, 
then lifted and checked for sheltering animals beneath before being carefully replaced. Potential 
reptile refuges already present on the Survey Site, such as discarded wood and large debris, were 
also inspected for the presence of reptiles. 
Visual Search 
3.21 
A visual search for reptiles within suitable habitats across the Survey Site was also undertaken 
during each survey visit. This helped to ensure that all areas were fully considered in the survey 
and helped eliminate a bias towards those reptile species more likely to use refugia. Visual 
searches involved walking slowly around the Survey Site in order to systematically search potential 
basking areas for reptiles in the areas between artificial refugia locations (Froglife, 1999). 
Reptile Survey Details  
3.22 
The following information was recorded during each reptile survey visit: species present; number of 
individuals present; approximate life stage (e.g. adult); location (refugia number or marked on map 
if visual encounter); date, survey start and finish times; and weather conditions. 
3.23 
Surveys were carried out during suitable weather conditions. Dates of the survey visits along with 
survey timings and weather conditions are provided in Table 2. Visits were undertaken on seven 
occasions in total, by Dr Jim Fairclough (JF) MCIEEM, Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, and 
John Woods (JW) Grad CIEEM (Table 1). (Note that the seventh and final survey visit is yet to be 
undertaken).

Results and Interpretation 
Great Crested Newts 
Desk Study 
4.1 
Surveys for GCN were undertaken in and around the Rookery Clay Pit CWS in 2008 (PBA, 2009). 
The presence of a large population of GCN was subsequently confirmed during these surveys. 
Trapping and translocation of newts has since taken place under a mitigation licence issued by 
Natural England in 2011. This has affected the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
incorporating the southern portion of the proposed access track and a proportion of the arable land 
in the north of the Survey Site, and had yielded over 6,000 GCNs (up to the end of July 2014), 
which were subsequently moved to receptor areas in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (400 
m east of the proposed access track) and a receptor area named Stewartby Way 2 (SW2) to the 
east of the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor. At the present time, the translocation programme 
is continuing in the south of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (Rookery Pit South) and is expected to be 
completed by November 2014. 
Habitat Suitability Assessment 
4.2 
During the field survey, 13 ponds were identified within the Survey Site. The locations and HSI 
scores attributed to these ponds are shown on Figure 1 (Appendix 1). A full description of each of 
the ponds, along with HSI scores, is included in Appendix 2. 
Amphibian Surveys 
4.3 
Eight ponds were found to contain GCN (Figure 2, Appendix 1). Evidence of egg-laying, which 
indicates breeding activity, was found in each of these ponds. In addition, eight ponds were found 
to support common toad Bufo bufo, a species of principal importance (s. 41; NERC Act 2006). A 
summary of the survey results can be found in Table 3 below, along with a note on the presence of 
common toad. Full survey results are detailed in Appendix 3 and selected photographs (referenced 
in Table 3) in Appendix 4.

Great Crested Newt Population Size Class Assessment 
4.5 
Four population clusters were identified, whereby a ‘population’ is defined as a collection of ponds 
where there is reasonable certainty of regular interchange of individuals between ponds (typically, 
within 250 m of each other and with an absence of barriers to dispersal) (English Nature, 2001). 
These included three small size-class and one medium size-class GCN populations, as shown on 
Figure 2. Results of the assessment are summarised in Table 4, below.

CWS. Reptiles are being translocated from Rookery South Pit, which is currently the subject of an 
ongoing LLRS. 
Reptile Surveys 
4.8 
Two common species of reptile were recorded at the Survey Site, namely common lizard and grass 
snake. No other reptile species have been recorded. The results of the surveys are summarised in 
Table 5 below and the locations at which common lizards and grass snakes were recorded are 
shown in Figure 3, Appendix 1. Full survey results are included in Appendix 5.

A total of 22 adult and seven juvenile common lizard observations were made throughout the 
survey visits, with a peak count of eight adults on visit one. Of these, 11 adult and two juvenile 
common lizard observations were made in Zone 11, a rough grassland field margin bordered to the 
north by a wooded copse and adjacent to the Bletchley to Bedford railway corridor that divides the 
Survey Site (Figure 3, Appendix 1). Common lizards were also observed in Zones 16 and 17 
(immediately south of the Project Site, adjacent to the railway corridor), Zone 2 (adjacent to the 
railway corridor), Zone 7 (along the southern edge of a wooded plantation), Zones 3 and 4 (along 
to a wide, heavily vegetated ditch with structurally diverse bankside vegetation) and Zone 5 (along 
the eastern edge of a semi-natural broadleaved woodland plantation).

4.11 
Ten adult and four juvenile grass snakes were observed during the survey visits, with a peak count 
of three adults on visit 4. Of these, five adult and three juvenile grass snake observations were 
made in Zone 5. Grass snake observations were also made at Zones 3, 7, 12, 16 and 17 (juvenile). 
4.12 
With the exception of Zone 17, which was immediately east of the railway corridor, no common 
lizards or grass snakes were observed to the east of the railway corridor that divides the Survey 
Site. Potential reptile habitat on land to the east of the railway corridor was less suitable and limited 
to field boundaries typically consisting of species poor hedgerows, wet ditches and uniform 
grassland field margins (see for example photograph 6 (Appendix 4)).

This pond lies in an arable field in the south of the Survey Site and covers an area of approximately 150-200m2 and is over 1 m in depth. Ruderal vegetation and 
scrub surrounds this pond offering some potential sheltering habitat to newts. Common duckweed was present on the pond and it is likely that run off from the 
surrounding field feeds into the pond possibly adversely affecting water quality.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake breeding bird surveys of all habitats within the red-
line boundary of the Project Site, as reported in the Project Scoping Report, plus a 50m buffer (the 
‘Survey Site’). The purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature 
review was also conducted, which covered the Project Site and land up to 2 km from this. 
1.3 
The desk study returned records of 158 birds of conservation importance, the great majority of 
which were derived from the Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS). 
1.4 
The breeding bird survey revealed 65 bird species that were breeding (or potentially breeding) 
within the Survey Site. Thirty-one of these appear on one or more schedules or lists of species of 
conservation importance. Bearded tit, gadwall, redshank and ringed plover are all associated with 
the reedbed habitat and open water within the clay pits (Rookery Clay Pits CWS). The land where 
these birds were recorded (the southern clay pit) is in the process of being restored as part of a 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. Towards the end of 2014, the base of 
Rookery South Pit it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that 
are required for the LLRS and therefore, would not be expected to support these birds beyond the 
end of 2014.   
1.5 
During a bat survey a single barn owl was incidentally observed hunting. No evidence of breeding 
was found on site, but they are likely to be breeding in the local area and occasionally using the 
Survey Site for foraging.

Introduction 
Background to Commission 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, as identified in the Project Scoping Report comprises the Power Generation Plant 
within Rookery South Pit, and the Gas and Electrical Connection Areas extending from The 
Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land to the south and east. The approximate centre of the 
Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and Milton 
Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site comprises the habitats within the red-line of the Project Site, as reported in the 
Project Scoping Report, along with a 50m buffer, as illustrated on Figure 1 Appendix 1. The main 
habitats within the Survey Site are arable fields, delineated by hedgerows, ditches and minor roads 
and lanes. To the north, an area of land exists that is in the process of being restored as part of a 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner. At the time of survey, in spring and 
summer of 2014, this area included sparsely vegetated ground, swamp and bare earth. Towards 
the end of 2014, it is expected to comprise just bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are 
required for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including breeding bird surveys. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which will be submitted, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The objective of the survey was to evaluate the bird assemblage using the Survey Site and identify 
key areas of habitat used by breeding birds, with particular attention to rare and notable bird 
species. This report aims to provide a list of bird species encountered and their breeding status (i.e. 
confirmed, probable or possible breeding on the Survey Site), and an estimate of the likely number 
of territories/colonies of bird species breeding on or close to the Survey Site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected and otherwise notable species was requested 
from the Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering 
the Survey Site and land up to 2 km away. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, including land within and immediately north of the Survey 
Site (PBA, 2009). 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The Survey Site was split into three sections; northern (comprising the existing access track, 
reedbed and disused clay pit (Rookery South Pit) and associated buffer), south-eastern and south-
western (both comprising predominantly arable farmland and small woodland copses to the east 
and west of the railway respectively). Three visits to each section were undertaken in the early 
morning by an experienced ornithologist, Ross Crates.  Survey duration on each visit was between 
3 and 5 hours.  
3.4 
In addition, two dusk surveys were conducted in peak breeding season to locate any 
crepuscular/nocturnal species such as barn owl Tyto alba, which may have been breeding or 
foraging on site. A building inspection of South Pillinge Farm was also conducted to survey for any 
barn owls potentially breeding in the farm buildings.  
3.5 
Dates of survey and weather conditions recorded during the surveys are summarised in Table 1.

3.6 
During each visit the Survey Site was walked at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be 
identified and located.  Frequent stops were made to scan suitable habitats and to listen for singing 
and calling birds.  All accessible areas of suitable breeding habitat within the Survey Site boundary 
and immediately adjacent areas were approached to within 50 m. 
3.7 
During the survey the location and activity of each bird detected (including those seen or heard) 
was recorded and mapped using standard two-letter BTO species codes combined with activity 
symbols. 
3.8 
Birds exhibiting breeding behaviour were assigned to one of three categories: possible breeding, 
probable breeding or confirmed breeding.  These are defined below (based on BTO criteria): 
 
Possible breeding: birds heard singing or alarm calling or simply present in suitable breeding 
habitat on one of the survey visits; 
 
Probable breeding:  a pair of birds present in suitable breeding habitat; a repeat observation of 
territorial behaviour (song or alarm calling) on two or more different visits in the same location; 
courtship behaviour or display in suitable breeding habitat; birds apparently visiting a nest site; 
or, evidence of nest building (including excavation of a hole); 
 
Confirmed breeding: one or more adults undertaking a distraction display; the presence of a 
used nest or eggshells; the presence of recently fledged or downy young (that are clearly of 
local origin); apparently incubating adults or adults commuting to and from a nest hole; adult 
birds carrying faecal sacs or food for young; or, a nest with eggs or young present. 
3.9 
Internal inspections of all buildings around South Pillinge Farm were also undertaken. Records 
were taken of any evidence of breeding barn owls, this can include: 
 
Droppings (white vertical streaks on roof beams and large white splashes on floors)  
 
Pellets. Barn owls generally swallow their prey whole and regurgitate the indigestible parts 
(bones, fur etc.) as pellets. The colour and condition of pellets can give an indication as to 
when a site was last used by barn owls.  
 
Feathers. Barn owl nestlings begin their initial moult at 11 months. Adult barn owls tend to 
shed their largest and most noticeable feathers (wing feathers) in the summer.  
 
Millbrook Power Plant

 
Nest debris. Barn owls do not build nests but nesting areas may contain nestling fluff and 
pellet debris.  
 
Potential entrance points. The minimum hole size required for barn owls to gain access to 
a building is 7 cm by 7 cm.  
 
Suitable nesting platforms. Barn owls need a level area to lay their eggs usually over 3 
metres in length and over 3 metres off the ground. Typical nesting places include tops of 
walls, between bales and attic floors. 
3.10 
To inform the assessment in this report, the numbers of potential territories identified, the 
abundance of species at the county and national level, the quality of the habitat present and the 
geographical range of the birds concerned have been considered, based on national and regional 
accounts. The Bedfordshire Bird Report (Nightingale, 2012) was consulted to assess the local 
population and distribution of each individual bird species. 
3.11 
Due to the relative abundance of ornithological data, it is often possible to derive population 
estimates within a defined geographical area (e.g. county).  A 1 % threshold can then be applied to 
indicate importance (e.g. 1 % of the county population is equivalent to county importance).  There 
is no fundamental biological basis for the 1 % threshold, but it does follow the rational for site 
selection set out within the Ramsar Convention 1971 (Criterion 6: A wetland should be considered 
internationally important if it regularly supports 1% of the individuals in a population of one species 
or subspecies of waterbird), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s SPA selection 
guidelines (JNCC, 2014). It has also been adopted for the purposes of defining thresholds of 
importance of waterfowl at the European and UK level by the BTO in their Wetland Bird Survey 
reporting (BTO 2014a). The 1% threshold is therefore considered to provide a reasonable and 
defensible basis for the evaluation of bird populations. 
Limitations to Methods 
3.12 
As with all breeding bird surveys following this technique, the process is open to some subjectivity 
in interpretation except where active nests are located. Therefore, these ‘territories’ will be classed 
as putative and their mapped locations will indicate the ‘centre’ of a territory and not necessarily the 
breeding location.   
3.13 
All visits were conducted in suitable weather conditions and during the optimal period for breeding 
bird surveys. It is therefore not considered that any significant constraints were encountered.

Results and Interpretation 
Desk Study 
4.1 
Records of 158 birds of conservation importance have been recorded from within a 2 km radius of 
the Survey Site, which are presented in Appendix 2. Thirty-seven of these are Schedule 1 species 
(Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)), and are highlighted by the use of italics for the 
common name in the table included at Appendix 2. The great majority of the records are derived 
from the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. Of the 37 Schedule 1 species, the following 11 species have 
potential to be associated with the Survey Site as suitable nesting habitat is present: 
 
Barn owl Tyto alba – This species tends to forage upon tussocky grassland with a good litter 
layer providing habitat for their preferred prey species (field voles). The semi-improved 
grassland and tall ruderal vegetation mosaic on the periphery of the Survey Site is therefore 
considered to provide some foraging habitat for barn owls. In addition, it is possible that some 
of the outbuildings associated with South Pillinge Farm could support this species. 
 
Bittern Botaurus stellari – Bitterns have been recorded within the reedbed in the lake in the 
north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the proposed access track). The dense 
reedbed on the periphery of the lake in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the 
proposed access track) continues to provide suitable nesting and foraging habitat for this 
species. 
 
Bearded tit Panurus biarmicus – The bearded tit is found almost exclusively within dense 
reedbeds. The dense reedbed on the periphery of the lake in north of the Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS (adjacent to the proposed access track) provides suitable nesting and foraging habitat for 
this species. 
 
Cetti’s warbler Cettia cetti – This species nests in dense scrub and reedbed habitats and was 
recorded within reed habitat adjacent to the proposed access track in January 2014. 
 
Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus – The plantation woodland within the Survey Site is considered 
to offer some, yet limited potential nesting and foraging habitat for firecrest. 
 
Garganey Anas querquedula – This species of duck nests in dense vegetation including 
reedbed. Suitable nesting habitat for this species is therefore also present within the dense 
reedbed on the periphery of the lake to the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
 
Hobby Falco subbuteo – This species has been observed foraging over the water-bodies within 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS during great crested newt translocation works in 2011 and 2013 
(Steven Foot, pers comm.). The more established, mature trees present within and adjacent to 
the Survey Site have some potential to be used as nesting habitat for this spring/summer 
migrant. 
 
Little-ringed plover Charadrius dubius – This species breeds on man-made habitats close to 
fresh water. Sand and gravel quarries are regularly used as breeding sites. This species was 
recorded nesting on site in 2011 and 2013 upon clay habitats adjacent to the water-bodies in 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (Steven Foot, pers comm.). Accordingly, there remains suitable 
habitat for this species to the north of the Survey Site. 
 
Mediterranean gull Larus melanocephalus – This species is known to breed near inland lakes 
and wetlands. The water-bodies in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS provide suitable nesting habitat 
for this species. 
 
Marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus – This species nests in dense reedbed and has been 
recorded foraging over the reedbed present in the northern and south-eastern areas of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS in 2011 and 2013 (Steven Foot, pers comm.).

 
Red kite Milvus milvus – This species was recorded circling above the Survey Site during the 
preliminary ecology survey (BSG Ecology, 2014). The more established, mature trees present 
within and adjacent to the Survey Site have potential to be used as nesting habitat for this 
species. 
4.2 
A number of bird Species of Principal Importance (Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(NERC) 2006 (s. 41)) were also shown to be present within 2 km of the Survey Site in the results of 
the desk study. Of these, the following could potentially nest within the Survey Site as suitable 
habitat is present for these species: dunnock Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer 
domesticus, starling Sturnus vulgaris, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniculus, skylark Alauda 
arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, yellowhammer Emberiza 
citronella, cuckoo Cuculus canorus and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava flavissima. 
Field Survey 
4.3 
A total of 54 bird species that could be breeding within the Project Site were recorded during the 
three survey visits combined. These are summarised in Table 2 together with an estimated number 
of confirmed, probable or possible breeding territories/nest sites. The indicative central point of 
each territory or location of individual bird records is shown in Appendix 1, Figure 2 (northern half of 
the Survey Site) and Figure 3 (southern half of the Survey Site).

A further nine additional species were recorded breeding outside the Project Site but within the 
Survey Site. Three additional species were assumed to be breeding within the wider area but were 
of relevance to this report due to their conservation significance. These are summarised in Table 3 
together with an estimated number of territories/nest sites. The indicative central point of each 
territory or location of individual bird records is also shown where appropriate in Appendix 1, Figure

In addition to the above, a further twelve bird species were recorded during the survey visits for 
which no evidence of breeding within the Survey Site was noted. This included individuals flying 
over the Survey Site or species which may breed locally but for which suitable nesting habitat 
either does not occur on the Survey Site, or where no behaviour suggesting breeding was 
recorded. These species are summarised in Table 4 below together with notes on use of the 
Survey Site.

4.8 
Barn owl. During a bat survey a single bird was observed hunting. No evidence of breeding was 
found within the Survey Site, including during the building inspection of South Pillinge Farm, but 
they are likely to be breeding in the local area and occasionally using the Survey Site for foraging. 
In general the Survey Site is very low quality foraging habitat for barn owls, predominantly 
consisting of large arable fields with very small field margins. The areas of higher quality foraging 
habitat include the areas of rank grassland along the margins of the woodland copses, the 
grassland surrounding South Pillinge Farm and the railway corridors. 
4.9 
Bearded tit. This is a species of extensive reedbed, principally in more coastal counties. During the 
surveys at least two birds were heard amongst common reed Phragmites australis (their breeding 
habitat) just outside the 50 m buffer zone to north-east of the Survey Site. A further pair was heard 
in the reedbed within the clay pit in the north-east of the site. 
4.10 
Bittern. A single male was heard booming to the north east, beyond the Survey Site boundary. 
There is currently no breeding habitat suitable for bittern within the Survey Site. The reedbed in the 
clay pit within the Project Site is currently drying out as the water is pumped away from this area to 
promote the implementation of the LLRS by the end of 2014, so the Project Site, or indeed, the 
Survey Site is unlikely to support suitable habitat for bittern by 2015. 
4.11 
Bullfinch. The bullfinch is a generalist species that normally breeds within dense hedges (Snow and 
Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). One confirmed pair had fledged young near the road 
bridge over the railway. The second probable pair bred in bushes near the northern entrance track. 
The final possible pair could have bred in the wooded copse to the west of the Survey Site. The 
site had one confirmed, one probable and one possible breeding pair. 
4.12 
Common tern. No evidence of breeding tern was found within the Survey Site, but four pairs are 
estimated to be breeding in the local area. 
4.13 
Cuckoo. The cuckoo’s favoured habitat is open woodland but females lay their eggs in the nest of 
other species (Dunnock, Reed Warbler and Meadow Pipit are favoured 'hosts') (Snow and Perrins, 
1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had two probable and one possible breeding 
pairs. 
4.14 
Dunnock. The dunnock is a generalist that will breed in any hedgerow or dense scrub. The Survey 
Site had one confirmed, 11 probable and two possible breeding pairs. 
4.15 
Gadwall. The Gadwall strongly prefers fairly shallow, eutrophic or standing open water, with plenty 
of cover from emergent vegetation and dry banks or islands for nesting (Snow and Perrins, 1998; 
RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had one possible breeding pair in the pools to the north 
of the Survey Site. Water is being pumped away from the area of pooled water in the clay pit within 
the Project Site to promote the implementation of the LLRS. The Project Site, or indeed, the Survey 
Site is unlikely to support suitable habitat for Gadwall by 2015. 
4.16 
Green woodpecker. The green woodpecker’s favoured habitat is woodland edge, but will breed in 
any suitable mature tree (Snow and Perrins, 1998). The Survey Site had one possible breeding 
pair near the Bletchley to Bedford railway to the north east of the Survey Site

4.17 
Grey partridge. Grey partridge prefers short grassland (not longer than 15 cm) with patches of 
scrub or hedgerows for them to nest at the base of and to provide cover (Snow and Perrins, 1998). 
There were one probable and one possible breeding pair spread across the Survey Site. 
4.18 
House sparrow. The house sparrow is a species that nests in loose colonies often utilising holes 
and crevices within buildings, but will also nest within dense hedgerows which is a very common 
habitat at the Survey Site. The Survey Site had three probable breeding pairs near the buildings on 
the western boundary. 
4.19 
Kestrel. There was a single pair breeding within the Survey Site but these were only seen foraging 
with no evidence of breeding within the Survey Site.        
4.20 
Lapwing. Lapwings breed on lowland farmland and unimproved pasture and meadows (RSPB, 
2014). The Survey Site had three confirmed and two probable breeding pairs concentrated in the 
southern clay pit to the north of the Survey Site. 
4.21 
Linnet. The linnet is a generalist, found where there are abundant sources of seed (typically 
associated with lowland farmland). It will nest in dense, thorny hedgerows or areas of scrub. There 
were seven probable and three possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
4.22 
Little grebe. The little grebe prefers small shallow water bodies (less than 1m), with muddy bottoms 
and a dense submerged aquatic vegetation. One probable pair was breeding in the pool within the 
southern clay pit. 
4.23 
Mallard. The mallard is extremely adaptable to a wide range of habitats, but essentially prefers still 
and shallow water (less than 1m) with ample plant growth such as the small ponds around the site 
(Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had one probable pair in a 
pond to the east of the railway and a second possible breeding pair in the lake margin in the clay 
pit. 
4.24 
Mistle thrush. The mistle thrush is a generalist species which breeds in a variety of habitats 
including gardens and farmland (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey 
Site had two probable breeding pairs in the woodland to the west. 
4.25 
Pochard. The pochard requires several hectares of shallow (1 - 2.5 m) of open water, uncluttered 
with floating vegetation but prolific with submerged plant and animal food (Snow and Perrins, 
1998). Two to three pairs were potentially breeding within the lake, beyond the Survey Site. The 
small pools being drained that are found within the Project Site (southern clay pit) are not large 
enough to support breeding pochard. 
4.26 
Redshank. The inland breeding habitat of redshank is limited to depressions, lakes and river 
basins, and other wetlands free of tall dense aquatic vegetation or closed stands of shrubs and 
trees (Snow and Perrins, 1998). A small flock was heard on visit 1, estimated to be approximately 
10 birds. Two pairs probably breeding were recorded within the Survey Site. Outside the Survey 
Site (but within the southern clay pit) a pair was confirmed breeding by the presence of young, and 
another pair probably breeding was recorded. 
4.27 
Reed bunting. The breeding habitat of reed bunting is restricted to low, dense vegetation, such as 
the reed beds and oilseed rape fields across the Survey Site. They will avoid open country as well 
as closed forests. (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). There were three confirmed 
and three possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
4.28 
Ringed plover. Ringed plover breeding habitat is limited to wide sandy or shingle lake margins 
(Snow and Perrins, 1998). One pair was probably breeding and two possibly breeding within the 
southern clay pit in the north of the Survey Site. 
4.29 
Skylark. Skylarks are ground nesting birds preferring open surfaces of firm, level or unobstructed 
soils preferably well clothed in grasses or cereals (Snow & Perrins, 1998). There were nine 
probable and one possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site.

4.30 
Song thrush. The song thrush is a generalist species that will nest in any suitable cover including 
scrub or hedgerows (Snow & Perrins, 1998). The Survey Site supported one confirmed, three 
probable and one possible breeding pairs. 
4.31 
Stock dove. The stock dove is a generalist species that nests in holes in trees, buildings and 
sometimes in abandoned rabbit warrens (Snow & Perrins, 1998). There were three probable 
breeding pairs in the small wooded copses across the Survey Site. 
4.32 
Barn Swallow. Swallows were not recorded breeding on the Survey Site, but more than three pairs 
were recorded within the farm buildings just beyond the Survey Site and were using the Survey 
Site to forage. 
4.33 
Tufted duck. The tufted duck is extremely adaptable to a wide range of water habitats, but prefer 
more open freshwater habitats not encroached by vegetation (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 
2014; BTO, 2014). The Survey Site had two probable breeding pairs on the pools being drained at 
the southern clay pit. 
4.34 
Turtle dove. The turtle dove prefers undisturbed habitat and will not breed in or very near towns. 
Although it is predominantly a ground feeder they are largely arboreal and will breed in small trees, 
shrubs or tall mature hedges (Snow and Perrins, 1998; RSPB, 2014; BTO, 2014). On the Survey 
Site a singing male was observed singing to the south end of the access track (northern part of the 
Survey Site), meaning a probable pair. 
4.35 
Whitethroat. Whitethroat is a generalist species that requires dense scrub or hedgerows for 
nesting. There were two confirmed and 16 probable breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
4.36 
Willow warbler. Willow warbler is a generalist species that requires scrub, hedgerows or woodland 
but nests within the dense vegetation at the base of these features (Snow & Perrins, 1998). The 
Survey Site had six probable breeding pairs mainly around the scrub adjacent to the railway 
corridors. 
4.37 
Yellow wagtail. In the breeding season yellow wagtail is confined to lowlands, occupying fringes of 
wetlands, such as rivers, lakesides and moist pastures (Snow and Perrins, 1998). It is a ground 
nesting bird using dense vegetation such as the reedbed on and adjacent to the Survey Site. 
Although there was potential for breeding on site no evidence was found. There was a single pair 
possibly breeding to the north east, beyond the Survey Site. 
4.38 
Yellowhammer. Yellowhammer is found on a wide variety of farmland types but is most common on 
lowland arable farmland. It nests at the base of dense hedgerows (occasionally on the ground 
earlier in the season) (Snow and Perrins, 1998). There were two confirmed, eight probable and two 
possible breeding pairs spread across the Survey Site. 
Distribution and abundance of Breeding Birds using the Survey Site 
4.39 
A total of 65 bird species were recorded breeding within the Survey Site, 31 of these appear on one 
or more schedules or lists of species of conservation importance. 
4.40 
The majority of the Survey Site is of limited value for breeding birds with large arable fields, 
delineated by hedgerows and ditches. The majority of the species are generalist species, breeding 
within the hedgerows, scrub and small wooded copses within the Survey Site with only skylark 
recorded breeding in the open fields. 
4.41 
The main interest feature within the Survey Site for breeding birds is the Rookery Clay Pits CWS. 
The southern half of this clay pit that lies within the Project Site presently includes sparsely 
vegetated ground, reedbed and bare earth. This southern clay pit is presently being restored as 
part of a LLRS by the landowner, so will have little value to the majority of the breeding birds 
observed here by the end of 2014. The northern clay pit, which is outside the Survey Site also 
includes reedbed habitat, but this is healthier and is found in association with open water. 
Accordingly, it is suitable for a more diverse range of breeding birds, which included a male 
booming bittern, bearded tit and pochard.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
1.2 
MPL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a suite of mammal surveys, specifically badger, 
bats, otter and water vole, in habitats within the red-line boundary of the Project Site as reported in 
the Project Scoping Report (the ‘Survey Site’) and for bats, extended to include South Pillinge 
Farm. The purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for Development 
Consent for the Power Generation Plant. A supporting desk study and literature review was also 
conducted, which covered the Project Site and land up to 2 km from this. 
1.3 
The desk study revealed the presence badger, otter and water vole activity around The Rookery 
Clay Pit CWS and roosting bats in buildings at South Pillinge Farm. 
1.4 
The badger survey identified the presence of a 6-entrance main / subsidiary badger sett within the 
Survey Site. 
1.5 
Evidence of bat activity was widely recorded across the Survey Site; however, the access track to 
the north of the Survey Site returned the highest number of records, primarily from the automated 
detector surveys. Several small, non-breeding summer roosts of common and soprano pipistrelle 
bats and brown long-eared bat were identified at South Pillinge Farm. 
1.6 
No evidence of otter or water vole activity was found within the Survey Site.

Introduction 
2.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant, with the Power 
Generation Plant Site located primarily on land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, and 
the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural 
land to the south and east. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Project Site, in which the Project would be located, comprises land within former clay pits 
known as ‘The Rookery’, and the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into 
the surrounding agricultural land. The approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 
501373, 240734, which is situated between Bedford and Milton Keynes. 
2.3 
The Survey Site for the badger survey comprised the red-line boundary of the Project Site as 
reported in the Project Scoping Report (see Figure 1).  The Survey Site for the otter and water vole 
survey included all watercourses or ditches within the Project Site (see Figure 5). The Survey Site 
for the bat surveys included the red-line boundary of the Project Site, extended to include South 
Pillinge Farm, located close to the north western boundary of the Project Site (see Figures 2a and 
2b and Figure 3). The main habitats within the Survey Site are arable fields with boundaries 
delineated by hedgerows, ditches, minor roads and lanes. To the north, an area of land exists that 
is in the process of being restored as part of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the 
landowner. At the time of survey, in spring and summer of 2014, this area included sparsely 
vegetated ground, swamp and bare earth. Towards the end of 2014, it is expected to comprise just 
bare earth following bulk movement of soils that are required for the LLRS. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).  It 
will connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground cable or 
overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which included a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This identified the 
need to undertake a suite of Phase 2 surveys in order to fully assess the nature conservation value 
of the Project Site, including mammal (badger, bat, otter and water vole) surveys. These baseline 
surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, 
which will be submitted, as an integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the mammal surveys were to identify whether protected or noteworthy1 mammal 
species, specifically badger, bats, otter and water vole, are present within the Survey Site, and 
where present, to obtain an understanding of abundance and distribution.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information regarding protected and notable species was requested from the 
Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC) covering the Survey 
Site and land up to 2 km away. This information was supplemented by previous survey and 
mitigation work undertaken by BSG Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, including land within 
and immediately north of the Survey Site (PBA, 2009; BSG Ecology 2013). 
Badgers 
3.2 
A dedicated badger survey was conducted by Greg Chamberlain and Dr Jim Fairclough on 30 July 
2014.  Where possible all areas of the Survey Site (see Figure 1, Appendix 1) were accessed. The 
survey involved walking over the Survey Site, searching for evidence of badgers and badger 
activity. Evidence searched for included sett entrances, latrine pits, foraging holes, paw prints, 
pathways in vegetation and badger hairs caught on fencing or vegetation. The dedicated survey 
conducted on 30 July 2014 was also supplemented with incidental records, taken during other 
species surveys (e.g. reptile surveys) conducted on a number of occasions in 2014. 
3.3 
Once a sett was discovered, an indication of the level of activity (following Neal and Cheeseman, 
1996) was also made, as follows: 
 
Active – active sett entrances contain no debris or vegetation, are obviously regularly used 
and often show signs of having been recently excavated. 
 
Partially used – partially used entrances are those not in regular use, and which may have 
debris (leaf litter, twigs, moss, etc.) around the entrance.  However, they could potentially be 
used regularly in the future with minimal clearance necessary. 
 
Disused – disused sett entrances show signs of not having been used for a considerable 
period of time and would not be used again without extensive clearance by a badger.    
3.4 
Several categories of badger setts have been identified (Neal and Cheeseman, 1996). These are 
described as follows: 
 
Main setts are defined as setts with five or more entrance holes and which show evidence of 
use throughout the year. Main setts are associated with large spoil heaps and well-trodden 
paths.  
 
Annexe setts – These setts are intermediate-sized and may be used by breeding badgers.  
These setts are normally close to a main sett (within 150 m of the main sett and connected to 
it by obvious paths). 
 
Subsidiary setts – These are similar to annexe setts but are likely to be further away (at least 
150 m from the main sett and not as well connected to the main sett as annexe setts).  
 
Outlier setts – Outlier setts are small setts with one or two entrance holes which are used 
sporadically by badgers as a temporary refuge.  There may be several outlier setts within one 
badger social group’s territory.   
3.5 
In addition to badger setts, other evidence of badgers was also recorded. This included:   
 
live or dead badgers; 
 
foraging scrapes (distinctive excavations made by badgers when searching for food); 
 
badger dung; 
 
dung pits (a badger will often deposit its dung within a small excavated pit); 
 
latrines (a collection of dung pits); 
 
badger guard hairs; 
 
pathways; and

 
badger tracks (footprints). 
Limitations to Methods 
3.6 
For health and safety reasons it was not possible to access Bletchley to Bedford rail land to check 
for badger activity close to the railway line. It is not thought that this presents a significant 
constraint, as likely presence of badgers could be confirmed through evidence such as large spoil 
heaps, latrines and pathways adjacent to (or beneath) the railway boundary fence. 
Bats 
3.7 
The arable habitats covering the majority of the Survey Site are considered to provide limited 
foraging opportunities for bats; however, the hedgerows, wooded copses and ditches were 
identified as being likely to provide a suitable commuting and foraging resource for bats in the 
wider landscape. Overall, the Survey Site has been assessed as being of ‘Low Habitat Quality’ 
according to the current best practice bat survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Therefore a range of 
methods were used at the appropriate level of survey effort as recommended by the guidelines: 
 
Walked transects; and  
 
Automated detector surveys.   
3.8 
In addition, buildings at South Pillinge Farm were surveyed for presence / likely absence of bats, 
and where present, to characterise the type of roost (e.g. number and species of bat using the 
roost). The following methods were used: 
 
Internal and external building inspection; and 
 
Dusk emergence and pre-dawn re-entry roost surveys. 
Bat Activity Surveys 
Walked transects 
3.9 
Seasonal walked surveys of two pre-determined transect routes (northern and southern) were 
undertaken in May (spring), July (summer) and September (autumn) 2014. Each transect started 
15 minutes before sunset and took approximately 2-3 hours to complete. The timing of the surveys 
therefore covers the bat emergence period and the period of most intense foraging activity when 
invertebrate prey is most abundant (Altringham, 2003).   
3.10 
The same transect route was walked on each survey visit with the start points and direction 
changed on each visit to ensure that different parts of the Survey Site were surveyed at different 
times of the night. This approach was adopted to remove any bias that could be introduced into the 
survey data if each transect was walked in the same direction. This bias could otherwise have 
resulted in any given point on the transect route being visited at approximately the same interval 
after sunset.  Static recording points were selected for each of the transects.  At these points the 
surveyor stood for 3 minutes to listen and record all bat passes, using bat detectors. 
3.11 
Bat activity was recorded using Anabat hand-held electronic bat detectors. This model of detector 
automatically records all the bat passes they detect, which significantly reduces the chances that 
bats could be missed due to human error. Wherever possible, surveyors recorded the observed 
behaviour and numbers of bats onto a field proforma. This was to aid identification and also to 
provide additional detail on the behaviour of observed bats. Field notes included a record of the 
time of each bat encounter, allowing results to be cross-referenced with the recorded data. 
3.12 
Details of the walked transect surveys are summarised in Table 1. A map of walked transect routes 
is presented in Figures 2a and 2b (Appendix 1). The main aim of the transect walks was to 
determine the location of areas of high bat activity, such as foraging areas and/or commuting 
routes (e.g. ditches and hedgerows). Accordingly, the selected transect routes focussed on such 
areas. 
3.13 
All walked transects avoided heavy rain, strong winds and dusk temperatures below 10oC as 
recommended in the BCT guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Dates of the survey visits along with survey 
timings and weather conditions are provided in Table 2. Surveys were undertaken by Dr Tom Flynn

Automated detector surveys 
3.14 
In addition to the transect surveys, automated detector surveys were conducted using Wildlife 
Acoustics Song Meter 2 (SM2) bat detectors. These detectors are also full spectrum detectors that 
are triggered automatically to record bat echolocation calls.  These detectors can be deployed and 
left to remotely record bat activity for a period of several nights. 
3.15 
Two SM2 detectors (Statics 1 and 2) were deployed, to assess bat activity along the vehicular track 
in the north west of the Survey Site and a section of scattered scrub approximately 100 m to the 
east of South Pillinge Farm, to supplement data from the transect surveys. The locations of Statics 
1 and 2 are shown on Figure 2a (Appendix 1). 
3.16 
The detectors were deployed for four consecutive nights at each of the locations, which allowed 
continuous monitoring to take place during the period when bats are active, i.e. sunset to sunrise. 
They were programmed to begin recording from half an hour before sunset until half an hour after 
sunrise.  Survey hours varied throughout the survey season according to daylight hours and have 
been calculated for each recording session in order to accurately calculate activity indices.  
3.17 
The automated detectors were deployed for the following dates: 30 May to 3 June 2014, 22 to 26 
July 2014 and 17 to 21 September 2014. This corresponded to approximately 202 survey hours. 
Bat call analysis 
3.18 
Recorded bat calls were analysed using Analook software to confirm the identity of the bats 
present. Where possible, the bat was identified to species level. Records of long-eared bats 
Plecotus sp. were not identified to species level due to the overlapping call parameters of the two 
native species but were assumed to refer to brown long-eared bats. It is possible that grey long-
eared bat Plecotus austriacus may occasionally occur in the region, but given the species’ known 
distribution (Swift & Entwistle 2008), it is highly unlikely. In addition, no records of this species were 
found from the desk study. Species of the genus Myotis were grouped together due to many of the 
species having overlapping call parameters making species identification problematic (Hundt, 
2012).  
3.19 
For Pipistrellus species the following criteria, based on measurements of peak frequency, were 
used to classify calls: 
 
Common pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥42 and <49 kHz 
 
Soprano pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥51 kHz 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
 
 
 
<39 kHz  
 
Common pipistrelle / soprano pipistrelle 
 
≥49 and <51 kHz 
 
Millbrook Power Plant 
 
8 
02/12/2014 
 
Common pipistrelle / Nathusius’ pipistrelle  
≥39 and <42 kHz 
3.20 
In addition, the following categories were used for calls which could not be identified with 
confidence due to the overlap in call characteristics between species or species groups: 
 
Myotis sp./brown long-eared bat;  
 
Nyctalus sp. (either Leisler’s bat or noctule); and 
 
Eptesicus/Nyctalus sp. (either serotine, noctule or Leisler's bat).  
3.21 
The Analook software enables analysis of the relative activity of different species of bats by 
counting the minimum number of bats recorded within discrete sound files. For the purposes of this 
analysis, the recording of one or more passes by a single species of bat within a 15 second sound 
file is counted as a single bat pass (B). During analysis of sound files, it was possible to estimate 
the minimum number of bats recorded on individual sound files but not whether consecutive sound 
files had recorded, for example, a number of individual bats passing as they commute to a feeding 
habitat or one bat calling repeatedly as it flies up and down a hedgerow, for instance. Therefore, 
relative abundance of bats cannot be estimated from this analysis, but the number of bat passes 
does reflect the relative importance of a feature/habitat to bats by assigning a level of bat activity 
that is associated with that feature, regardless of the type of activity. In this analysis, bat passes 
per hour (B/h) has been used as a measure of ‘relative activity’.  
Limitations to methods 
3.22 
The aim of automated detector monitoring was to collect 4 nights of data in each season (spring, 
summer and autumn). However, during the summer survey in July the SM2 unit located at static 
position 2 (S2) failed during the third night of monitoring. Given that the measure of ‘relative activity’ 
used in this analysis is bat passes per hour, it was still possible to extract useful data, albeit based 
on a reduced sample size. This is therefore not considered a significant constraint. 
Roost Surveys 
Internal and external building Inspection 
3.23 
On 19 May 2014 an internal and external building inspection survey was undertaken at South 
Pillinge Farm by Laura Grant (Natural England Bat Licence no. CLS001496). Ten buildings 
(Buildings B1 – B10) (see Figure 3, Appendix 1) were inspected to assess their potential to support 
roosting bats and to search for evidence of bat activity. 
3.24 
During the survey a thorough search was made of the buildings including all accessible areas and 
crevices for bats, their droppings, food remains or characteristic grease marks at potential roost 
exit/entrance points.  The exterior of the buildings were searched, paying particular attention to 
window ledges, where droppings can gather undisturbed, and under potential roost access points, 
such as loose tiles and gaps between boarding. Where possible, internal inspections were also 
undertaken.   
3.25 
Signs of bat activity searched for included: 
 
Live bats; 
 
Droppings; 
 
Urine spots; 
 
Feeding remains (e.g. discarded wings of flying invertebrates); 
 
Oil staining; 
 
Smell; 
 
Daytime vocalisations; 
 
Absence of cobwebs (a well-used bat roost and its access points are typically clear of 
cobwebs); 
 
Scratching; 
 
Millbrook Power Plant

02/12/2014 
 
Dead bats; and 
 
Tracks in dust (by a roost). 
3.26 
All buildings were assigned a category defining their potential to support roosting bats in 
accordance with Table 2 below. 
Table 2: Categories of bat potential of buildings 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
Negligible  
Building with no or very limited roosting opportunities for bats, no 
evidence of use by bats and where the feature is isolated from foraging 
habitat. 
Low  
Building with a limited number of roosting opportunities, no evidence of 
current use by bats and with poor connectivity to foraging habitat. 
Medium  
Building with some roosting opportunities, with no evidence of current 
use by bats and with connectivity to moderate – high quality foraging 
habitat. 
High  
Building with multiple roosting opportunities for one or more species of 
bat, and with good connectivity to high quality foraging habitat. 
Confirmed Roost 
Presence of bats or evidence of recent use by bats. 
Bat emergence and re-entry surveys 
3.27 
In order to establish the presence/likely absence of bat roosts within the buildings, and to establish 
the species and number of bats using the buildings, one dusk emergence and one pre-dawn re-
entry survey was undertaken. These surveys covered those buildings where either a bat roost had 
been found or where the building was assessed as having medium or high potential to support 
roosting bats. Surveys involve ecologists watching and listening for bats leaving their roosts at dusk 
(emerging) and / or returning to a roost pre-dawn (re-entry). 
3.28 
From the inspection survey two buildings were found to contain bat roosts / have high potential to 
support bat roosts and three buildings were deemed to have medium potential to support roosting 
bats. In order to adequately survey these five buildings, eight surveyors were utilised for the 
surveys. Surveyors were positioned outside the buildings at points where potential bat access 
points could be observed. 
3.29 
Surveyors were equipped with an Anabat bat detector to enable the bat calls to be recorded to 
assist with species identification. The recorded calls were then analysed using Analook sonogram 
software. 
3.30 
Dates of the survey visits along with survey timings and weather conditions are provided in Table 3. 
Surveys were led by Laura Grant (LG) (Natural England Bat Licence no. CLS001496) and Hannah 
Bilston (HB) (Natural England Bat Licence no. CLS00548). The survey team comprised Dr Jim 
Fairclough (JF) MCIEEM, Greg Chamberlain (GHC) MCIEEM, John Woods (JW) Grad CIEEM,

Limitations to Methods 
3.31 
During the pre-dawn re-entry survey on 23 July 2014, one Anabat failed. As a result, one surveyor 
(Laura Grant, positioned at VP2) used a BatBox Duet detector and, in the absence of a recording 
device, undertook species identification in the field. Laura Grant is a highly experienced, licenced 
bat worker, skilled in species identification. As such, an absence of bat call recordings is not 
considered a significant constraint. 
Otter and Water Vole 
Otter and water vole survey 
3.32 
An otter and water vole survey was undertaken at the site on 19 May 2014, which coincides with 
the spring peak levels of activity for water vole (Strachan et al., 2011). The survey was undertaken 
by Dr Jim Fairclough MCIEEM, assisted by Greg Chamberlain MCIEEM and John Woods 
GradCIEEM. The weather during the survey was dry, with intermittent sun and a light wind. 
3.33 
Ditches present across the Survey Site were surveyed for water vole and otter. This included an 
assessment of the suitability of each section of ditch for water vole. The survey covered 
approximately 2.3 km of ditch, as shown on Figure 5 (Appendix 1). Each ditch was searched for 
evidence of water vole following best practice guidance provided in the Water Vole Conservation 
Handbook (Strachan et al., 2011). This included visual searches for the following signs: 
 
Latrines - comprising a concentration of droppings in discrete locations, often near nest sites, 
at range boundaries or at places used to enter and exit the water; 
 
Feeding stations - comprising neat piles of chewed lengths of vegetation, usually up to 10 cm 
in length, on pathways or haul-out locations; 
 
Burrows - these are typically found along the water’s edge and on top of the bank (up to 5 m 
from the water’s edge) and are 4-8 cm in diameter. Holes on top of the banks often have 
‘lawns’ around them (areas of grazed vegetation); and 
 
Footprints - located in soft mud or silt. 
3.34 
In addition, any evidence of otter, such as droppings (‘spraints’), runs, holts and footprints, was 
recorded. 
3.35 
One section of ditch within the Survey Site, north west of Ditch 2b (see Figure 5, Appendix 1), was 
not surveyed during the present (2014) surveys. This is due to the ditch being within the area being 
restored as part of the LLRS. Water vole was not recorded as being present in this ditch section 
during surveys completed in 2008 and 2009 (PBA, 2009). 
Other Notable Mammal Species 
3.36 
During surveys targeted at other species, incidental observations of other notable mammal species 
of principal importance (s. 41; NERC Act 2006) were recorded.

Results and Interpretation 
Badger 
Desk study 
4.1 
BSG Ecology undertook badger surveys in September 2008 (PBA, 2009). These surveys identified 
the presence of badger latrines within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS; however, no evidence of badger 
setts were identified. 
4.2 
A foraging badger was noted within scrub between the northern and southern halves of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS approximately 500 m to the east of the proposed access track, during great 
crested newt surveys of Rookery North Pit in 2013 (BSG Ecology, 2013).  
Badger survey 
4.3 
An active badger sett comprising six well-used entrances was identified within a small copse within 
the Survey Site, as shown on confidential Figure 1, Appendix 1. Given the absence of other badger 
setts within the Survey Site, this is likely to be a main or subsidiary sett. Mammal tracks of 
indeterminable origin, and therefore possibly attributable to badger, and two atypical latrines 
(probably badger) were also identified within the Survey Site, as shown on confidential Figure 1, 
Appendix 1. 
Bats 
Desk study 
4.4 
In 2008, BSG Ecology undertook activity surveys, building and tree inspection surveys and dusk 
emergence/dawn return to roost surveys for bats at The Rookery Clay Pit CWS and the 
surrounding area (PBA, 2009).  The activity surveys recorded an assemblage of eight species of 
bat foraging and/or commuting within and around the northern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
These species included common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
pygmaeus and Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii; noctule Nyctalus noctula; serotine 
Eptesicus serotinus; barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus; Leisler’s bats Nyctalus leisleri and a 
Myotis spp. Buildings at South Pillinge Farm were also assessed to determine the presence / likely 
absence of roosting bats. 
4.5 
Of the buildings that were surveyed, five were found to contain evidence of the presence of bats. 
The farmhouse was found to support a brown long-eared Plecotus auritus roost in the loft. A small 
number of bats were seen during the survey, and droppings were found that were thought to be 
from this species only (PBA, 2008). 
4.6 
The desk study (BRMC) also provided records of nine species of bats from within a 2 km radius of 
the Survey Site. The closest of these were a noctule bat found on a tree 150 m to the west of the 
Survey Site in 2012 and a Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii from 300 m to the west in 2009. 
Walked transects 
4.7 
A least six bat species were recorded during the walked transect surveys (walked transects) 
undertaken to date. The confirmed species or species groups include: 
 
Myotis spp.; 
 
Noctule; 
 
Barbastelle;  
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle;  
 
Common pipistrelle; and 
 
Soprano pipistrelle.

The northern transect focussed on the access track that runs along the western edge of The 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS, the wet ditch and plantation edge to the south of The Rookery Clay Pit 
CWS, South Pillinge Farm and an area of plantation woodland to the south of this (Figure 2a, 
Appendix 1). The southern transect focused on field margins and hedgerows within the central 
section of the Survey Site (Figure 1b, Appendix 1). Relative activity levels were similar on both 
transects. 
4.10 
During the transect surveys, common and soprano pipistrelle bats were the most frequently 
recorded bat species accounting for 47.1% and 28% of all the bat calls recorded respectively. 
These were encountered commuting across the Survey Site and foraging along hedgerows and 
plantation woodland edges.  Six Nathusius’ pipistrelle calls were recorded, 5 of which were 
detected at South Pillinge Farm and one of which was detected near the northernmost point of the 
Survey Site. 
4.11 
Calls of species other than pipistrelles were only recorded in very low numbers during the walked 
transect surveys.  The patterns of activity of these species recorded during the walked transects 
are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
4.12 
Noctule were recorded in May and July and account for 5.1% of all recorded calls. Most of the 
noctule calls were recorded in July, these were bats commuting over the site. 
4.13 
Myotis species were also recorded in May, July and September, with 3, 4 and 4 calls recorded 
respectively, accounting for 3.5% of the total calls recorded. Myotis calls were encountered 
scattered in pockets throughout the Survey Site including along the access track to the west of The 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS, near the woodland plantation to the south of The Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
and near South Pillinge Farm.

Barbastelle account for 0.6% of all recorded calls, with only two passes being recorded, Both 
barbastelle passes were recorded in September on the northern transect on the access track to the

Most of the species were recorded outside typical roost emergence times (see Table 5, below). 
Some Myotis species calls during the July transect were recorded before 70 minutes after sunset 
which is within the typical emergence period for this species group (typically between 30 and 70 
minutes after sunset) indicating the species may be roosting within or near to the Survey Site 
(Hundt, 2012).

As with the transect survey findings, the static monitoring survey data clearly show that common 
and soprano pipistrelle bats were the bat species most frequently recorded, accounting for 9,096 
(3,369 common pipistrelle, 5,437 soprano pipistrelle and 290 either common or soprano pipistrelle) 
out of 9,638 bat calls from the static detectors combined, which equates to over 94% of the total 
bat calls recorded during automated detector surveys. 
4.20 
Myotis species were the second most frequent bat species/groups recorded during static 
monitoring. However, compared with the common pipistrelle, the level of activity recorded by static 
detectors was much lower with an overall total of 329 calls accounting for 3.4% of the total activity.  
4.21 
The next most frequently recorded species were noctule, barbastelle and long-eared bat sp. with a 
total of 104, 29 and 24 calls recorded across the whole monitoring period accounting for 1.1%, 
0.3% and 0.2% respectively, of all calls recorded during the static surveys.  Noctule bats and 
possibly long-eared (only long-eared species calls with parameters overlapping with serotine and 
Myotis sp. bats were recorded during the May period) were recorded in all months, albeit in low 
numbers. Barbastelle were only recorded during the May and September survey periods. 
4.22 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle, Leisler’s bat and serotine each accounted for less than 0.1% of all calls 
recorded, with 7, 7 and 3 calls recorded respectively.  
4.23 
Bat activity was considerably higher at S2 than at S1. During the May survey period, bat passes (of 
all species) occurred at a rate of 221.39 passes per hour at S2, whereas as no passes were 
recorded at S1. During the July survey period, whilst overall bat activity was lower than in May, bat 
activity at S2 (47.97 passes per hour) was again higher than at S1 (10.91). During the September 
survey period overall bat activity was lower than in July or May. Bat activity at S2 (31.83 passes per 
hour) was higher than at S1 (5.44 passes per hour). This is largely due to significantly higher 
common and soprano pipistrelle bat activity at S2 than S1.

Internal and external building inspection  
4.24 
The assessment of roosting potential for each of the buildings located at South Pillinge Farm is 
shown in Figure 3, Appendix 1.  The findings of the external, and where applicable internal 
inspection, are described in Table 7 below. 
4.25 
Two buildings (Buildings B5 and B6) were assessed as offering high potential to support roosting 
bats due to multiple roosting opportunities and immediate connectivity with suitable foraging 
habitat. Buildings B5 and B6 both contained evidence of use by bats.  Building B5 offers a large 
number of external roosting opportunities and access to open internal roof structures.  Building B6 
offers external roosting opportunities and potential access to an internal roost space. Whilst no 
internal inspection was undertaken in Building B6, the desk study revealed that a brown long-eared 
bat roost was present in the loft (PBA, 2009). Discussion with the farmer indicated that, at the time 
of survey, this roost was still present. 
4.26 
Three buildings (Buildings B3, B8 and B10) were assessed as offering a medium potential to 
support roosting bats due to several roosting opportunities and immediate connectivity with suitable 
foraging habitat. A further four buildings were assessed as offering a low potential to support 
roosting bats due to a limited number of features suitable for roosting bats (Buildings B1, B2, B4 
and B7). 
4.27 
One building (Building B9) was assessed as offering negligible potential to support roosting bats 
due to a lack of features capable of supporting roosting bat.

Bat emergence and re-entry surveys 
4.28 
During the emergence / re-entry surveys undertaken at South Pillinge Farm, bats were observed 
emerging from or re-entering to roost within three of the buildings, Buildings B5, B6 and B8. No 
other buildings were found to support roosting bats. Survey findings are described below and likely 
roost access points are shown on Figure 4, Appendix 1. 
Building B5 
4.29 
During the re-entry survey on 23 July 2014, a soprano pipistrelle bat was observed re-entering a 
roost, accessed through a gap between bricks where a piece of mortar was missing in the western 
wall, at 04.41 (29 minutes before sunrise). In addition a pipistrelle species bat was observed re-
entering a roost within the western elevation of the building at 04.35, 35 minutes before sunrise. 
Later inspection of the wall revealed the probable roost access point to be a clean gap in the corner 
of a damaged brick. 
4.30 
On 30 July, during the emergence survey, a pipistrelle species bat exited the building at 21.27, 31 
minutes after sunrise, from the northern-most window on the western elevation of the building. This 
bat is likely to have been roosting in an internal building feature. Also at 21.27, a common 
pipistrelle bat was observed as having emerged from beneath a ridge tile located in the extension 
to the south side of the central (of three) courtyard area. Two minutes later a common pipistrelle 
bat exited the central section of building B5 through the barn door, having likely emerged from a 
roost located within the building’s interior. 
4.31 
A brown long-eared bat returned to roost at 04.22 on 23 July 2014, 48 minutes before sunrise, 
within the northern end of the building via an access point (slots in a partially covered window 
space) located near the northern end of the western wall.  Prior to this, a Myotis sp. bat was seen 
flying towards the north west corner of the building at roof height at 04.04, 66 minutes before 
sunrise. Given the direction of flight and proximity to sunrise, it is possible that this Myotis sp. bat 
re-entered a roost 
4.32 
These findings indicate that Building B5 supports a number of small, non-breeding summer roosts 
of common and soprano pipistrelle bats, a brown long-eared bat and possibly a Myotis sp. bat. 
Building B6 
4.33 
During the re-entry survey a common pipistrelle bat re-entered a roost, accessed under a loose 
roof tile, at 04.39, 31 minutes before sunrise. During the emergence survey a pipistrelle species bat 
and a soprano pipistelle bat emerged from under loose tiles. The pipistrelle species bat emerged at 
21.09, 13 minutes after sunset, from a roost exit point located near the roof apex near the eastern 
side of the building. At 21.30, 34 minutes after sunset, a soprano pipistrelle bat emerged from a 
roost exit point located on the western side of the roof. 
4.34 
Four brown long-eared bats were observed flying close to the roof of Building B6 during the re-
entry survey between 04.35 and 04.39, 35 – 31 minutes before sunrise. Given the proximity of 
these observations to sunrise and of the flights to the roof, it is probable that these long-eared bats 
re-entered the farmhouse to roost via access points in the roof. During the emergence survey, a 
long-eared bat is likely to have emerged from an access point located in the roof on the western 
side of the building at 21.25, 29 minutes after sunset.  
4.35 
These findings indicate that the Building B6 supports a number of small, non-breeding summer 
roosts of common and soprano pipistrelle bats and for brown long-eared bats. 
Building B8 
4.36 
Two pipistrelle species bats re-entered a roost between 04.35 and 04.37, 35 – 33 minutes before 
sunrise. Access was gained via a slot behind a barge board on the western elevation.  
4.37 
These findings indicate that Building B8 supports a non-breeding summer roost for a pipistrelle bat 
species.

Otter and water vole 
Desk study 
Water vole 
4.38 
The survey carried out by BSG Ecology in October 2008 identified the presence of a water vole 
latrine, a large feeding cache and several runs (PBA, 2009). These signs were found on the 
northern fringe of the largest waterbody in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS and provide direct evidence 
of water voles presence in close proximity to the Survey Site. No signs of water vole activity were 
found during a subsequent survey carried out in May 2009 (PBA, 2009).  During this survey, areas 
of vegetation were located that had been disturbed by wildfowl, in particular geese, and deer.  
There were also frequent signs of fox activity and possible signs of mink presence. The closest 
most recent record of water vole in the desk study was from 1.5 km to the north of the Survey Site 
in 2012. 
Otter 
4.39 
During surveys undertaken in 2008 a single otter print was recorded on a clay bank in the south-
east of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (PBA, 2009). No other evidence of otter activity was recorded 
during the survey. The large water-body in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the 
proposed access) supports a healthy fish population and it is likely that otters regularly use this 
water-body and the adjacent Stewartby Lake CWS as a foraging resource. 
Otter and water vole survey  
4.40 
No evidence of water vole presence was found. Ditches within the Survey Site, as shown on Figure 
5 (Appendix 1) and summarised in Table 8, below, had poor to sub-optimal habitat suitability for 
water vole.

Conium maculatum, cleavers Gallium aparine and hogweed 
Heracleum sphondylium. Hedge on western bank. Wetland plants 
infrequent but include great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum, fools

but occasional gaps with abundant marginal vegetation. Shaded 
sections sparse beneath. Open sections (which are few) include 
abundant fool’s watercress and great willowherb and frequent 
coarse grasses. Poor suitability, in most part due to lack of forage 
and shallow depth.

depth of ca. 5 cm. Heavily shaded on both sides by a shrub layer 
dominated by hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna and mature trees, 
including frequent ash Fraxinus excelsior and occasional apple 
Malus sp. No emergent macrophytes. Common nettle Urtica 
dioica only on banks. Poor suitability, in most part due to lack of 
forage and shallow depth. 
Poor 
Ditch 5 
Ditch adjacent to Lombardy Poplar Populus nigra plantation. 
Variable shape, ca. 6 m from bank to bank with a channel depth of 
c. 2 m. Contains flowing water to a depth of 15 – 20 cm. Ditch 
heavily shaded on west side with mature Lombardy poplar. 
Common nettle dominates both banks. Bank vegetation also 
includes frequent great willowherb and occasional hogweed. Poor 
suitability, in most part due to lack of forage and shallow depth. 
Poor 
4.41 
No evidence of otter presence was found. There are few foraging opportunities for otter within the 
Survey Site, which supports generally intensively managed habitats with few places that otters 
could use as resting sites. The only exception would be along the access road (northern part of the 
Survey Site, adjacent to the large water-filled lagoon of Rookery Clat Pit CWS (northern lagoon). It 
is also relevant that ditches within the Survey Site have limited connectivity to suitable habitats in 
the wider area. 
Other protected and notable mammal species 
4.42 
Records for all of the following species have been revealed during the desk study, and are listed as 
Species of Principal Importance on s. 41 of the NERC Act 2006. During the surveys conducted in 
2014 surveyors were vigilant to the potential presence of these species across the Survey Site. 
Accordingly, when any of these animals (or evidence of the presence of an animal) was seen a 
record was duly made, the results of which are annotated on Figure 6 (Appendix 1). 
Brown hare 
4.43 
Three brown hare Lepus europaeus were recorded on site during an initial walkover survey of the 
Survey Site (BSG Ecology, 2014). 
4.44 
During the targeted surveys in spring and summer 2014, a further nine records of brown hare were 
made within the Survey Site, and one approximately 100 m to the south. These records were made 
over four different survey visits: 17 April (5 observations), 14 May (1 observation), 19 May (1 
observation) and 30 July (3 observations). 
4.45 
This species is common and widespread in the UK where they are most common in arable areas 
where cereal growing predominates (Harris & Yalden, 2008). The majority of the records made 
were of animals within arable fields, albeit close to field margins, near hedgerows or the railway 
corridor. 
Hedgehog 
4.46 
The closest record of a hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus provided in the results of the desk study 
was approximately 190 m to the west of the Survey Site. Hedgehogs are found in most lowland 
habitats but have a preference for grassland in close proximity to woodland, scrub or hedgerows 
(Harris & Yalden, 2008). 
4.47 
No incidental observations of hedgehog were made during the 2014 surveys.

Harvest Mouse 
4.48 
The harvest mouse Micromys minutus favours areas of tall, dense grassy vegetation with breeding 
nests often constructed in cereal crops, long grass, reed beds, rushes and bramble patches (Harris 
& Yalden, 2008). This species was identified in the north of the Survey Site during clearance of the 
arable/ruderal habitats in autumn 2012 as part of the great crested newt licence works (Steven 
Foot, pers comm). 
4.49 
Some of the denser marginal vegetation adjacent to the proposed access track, the field margins 
and within the understorey of the plantation mixed woodland in the centre of the Survey Site has 
the potential to support this species; however, no incidental observations of harvest mouse were 
made during the 2014 surveys.

Background 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document comprises a Habitat Regulations Assessment: No Significant 
Effects Report, relating to the proposed Millbrook Power Project (hereafter 
referred to as the “Project”). It has been prepared by Peter Brett Associates 
LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), (the "Applicant"). 
1.1.2 
The Project is proposed at the former clay extraction pit named Rookery South 
Pit, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the approximate centre of the site at 
grid reference 501373, 240734 (the "Project Site").  The boundary of the 
Project Site falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford 
Borough Council (BBC) areas.  The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 (the "Act") and 
therefore requires development consent under the Act.  
1.1.3 
The application for the DCO is being made to the Planning Inspectorate 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 and in accordance with the Infrastructure 
Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2009 
(the “APFP Regulations”). 
1.1.4 
Before the Secretary of State can decide to grant a DCO for the Project he 
must determine whether it will have a significant effect on a European site 
(whether alone or in combination with other plans or projects), in view of that 
site's conservation objectives.  This requirement is set down in Regulation 61 
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) 
(the "Habitats Regulations").   
1.1.5 
APFP Regulation 5(2)(g) requires that the Application should be accompanied 
by a report which identifies any site that may be affected by the development 
and to which Regulation 61 of the Habitats Regulations applies. These sites 
are commonly referred to as ‘European Sites’.  European Sites include Special 
Areas of Conservation (SACs) (including candidate SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs), which together, form the Natura 2000 network, 
which aims to assure the long-term survival of Europe’s most valuable and 
threatened habitats. 
1.1.6 
In accordance with paragraph 118 of the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF), potential SPAs being considered by the Secretary of State for 
classification as a SPA, should be given the same protection as a fully 
classified SPA. In addition, Ramsar Sites and proposed Ramsar Sites 
(wetlands of international importance listed under the Ramsar convention) 
should be given the same protection as European sites.   
1.1.7 
This report is intended to provide the information necessary for the Secretary 
of State to make his assessment and it has been prepared in accordance with 
PINS Advice Note 10.  It has been prepared in accordance with the 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project

methodology for HRA set out in The Habitats Regulations Assessment 
Handbook (DTA Publications Ltd, 20161). 
1.2 
The Project 
1.2.1 
The Project would comprise: 
• a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an OpenCycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW).  This is 
measured as the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at 
the terminal points of the Generating Equipment. The Power Generation 
Plant comprises: 
o generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator, one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as 
the ‘Generating Equipment’), which are located within the 
‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
o a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);  
o a temporary construction compound required during construction 
only (the ‘Laydown Area’); 
• a new gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the ‘Gas 
Connection’). This element incorporates an Above Ground Installation 
(AGI) at the point of connection to the NTS; and 
• a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the ‘Electrical Connection’). This element could be delivered in one of two 
ways:  
o The first option would involve one underground double circuit Tee-
in. This would require one new tower (which will replace an existing 
tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional 
towers). This option would also require two SECs, one located on 
each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would 
then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 
metres in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). This is 
hereafter referred to as "Option 1". 
o The second option is similar to Option 1 and would involve an 
underground single circuit turn in (requiring two cable circuits, one 
into and one out of the substation). This would require one new 
tower (which will again replace an existing tower and be located in

the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby 
resulting in no net additional towers). This option would also require 
one larger SEC, which could be located on either side of the existing 
transmission line, and both circuits would then be connected via 
underground cables approximately 500 metres in length to a new 
substation (the ‘Substation’). This is hereafter referred to as "Option 
2". 
1.2.2 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’.  
1.2.3 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’ and are 
all integral to the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that 
electricity to the NETS. The land upon which the Project would be developed, 
or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the 
Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  
1.2.4 
The Project Site and all elements of the Project listed above are shown on 
Figure 1.2 of the PEIR for the Project.    
1.2.5 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former clay 
pits known as ‘The Rookery’, with the Gas and Electrical Connections 
extending from The Rookery into adjacent agricultural land to the south.  
1.2.6 
The total construction programme will be approximately 22 months, with a 
start date of 2020 and an end date of 2022.  The operational life of the Power 
Generation Plant will be 25 years.   
1.2.7 
The decommissioning phase will be similar in duration to the construction 
phase.  The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at 
the end of its operational life.  The Gas Pipeline will be made safe and left in 
situ.  
1.3 
Project Site and Surroundings 
The Rookery 
1.3.1 
The Project Site is partially located within 'The Rookery'.  The Rookery 
comprises two former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South (both 
shown on Figure 1.2) covering an area of some 210 ha, separated by an east-
west spine of unexcavated clay.  The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale 
between Milton Keynes and Bedford.  It lies predominantly within the 
administrative area of Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) although it also 
falls, in part, within the administrative area of the adjacent Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC).  
1.3.2 
The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within part of 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
4 
Rookery South Pit which is approximately 95 ha in area and is bound by steep 
clay banks that are varied in nature and substrate. The level of the pit base 
currently varies between approximately 10 and 15 m below ground level and 
includes open water, reed beds, pools and bare inundated clay.  The land that 
remains at the original ground level, approximately 42 m above ordnance 
datum (AOD) immediately around the periphery of Rookery South Pit is 
predominantly bare ground that has been previously cleared of vegetation and 
subsequently maintained in this state over approximately the last 28 years.  
1.3.3 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would extend from Rookery 
South Pit into farmland to the south as shown on Figure 1.2. Part of the 
Access Road would lie within Rookery North Pit.  
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
1.3.4 
The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing LLRS being undertaken by the 
landowner pursuant to a separate planning consent (application number -  
BC/CM/2000/8) in order to restore the former clay workings (i.e. below pre-
excavation ground levels) to low-intensity agricultural land, with measures 
included in the restoration to enhance biodiversity and landscape.  This 
restoration work is taking place independently of the Project, although a five 
year option agreement, which is extendable to seven under certain conditions, 
has been put in place between the Applicant and the landowner of Rookery 
Pit. Included in the agreement is a clause which ensures that the elements of 
the LLRS as set out below at 3.1.5 will be completed prior to the 
commencement of the development of the Project (anticipated to be in 2020). 
The HRA assessment assumes that the following LLRS works for Rookery 
South Pit have been completed:   
• the re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils and 
clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side with re-
grading of the base of the pit to an approximate level of 15mbgl; 
• implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction of 
an attenuation pond and pumping station in order to facilitate a 
managed surface water drainage strategy; 
• a landscape strategy to include planting on the boundary of the 
[Rookery South Pit] and the margins of the attenuation pond;  
• provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to 
ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through 
excavation; 
• provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of 
Rookery North Pit and around the attenuation pond within Rookery 
South Pit;  
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
5 
• provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North 
Pit which connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along 
the western side of Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp and existing 
track are both of an agricultural standard; and 
• provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery 
South Pit from the south side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, 
near Millbrook Station. 
1.3.5 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of the existing extent of Rookery 
South Pit will be undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms 
part of the existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not 
historically been subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will 
provide material for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to 
Rookery South Pit together with the implementation of a landscape and 
ecology strategy, which will integrate with ecological mitigation works and 
strategic landscape planting in Rookery North Pit.  
1.3.6 
The LLRS works will be completed prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project, with the possible exception of buttressing and re-
profiling to the eastern side of Rookery South Pit, which has no bearing on the 
Project as it lies outside the boundary of the Project Site.  
1.3.7 
Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 
15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating 
Equipment Site, Laydown Area and the Substation.

1.4 
European Sites in the Vicinity of the Project 
1.4.1 
There are no specific criteria in PINS Advice Note 10 for the Screening of 
effects on European Sites.  The study area for Screening is dependent upon 
the scale and nature of the project and European Site, and the surrounding 
environment where the potential for significant effects could reasonably be 
considered to occur. 
1.4.2 
The nearest European Site to the Project Site is Chiltern Beechwoods SAC, 
which is located approximately 27 km to the south-west.  The nearest SPA/ 
Ramsar Site is the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA/ Ramsar Site, which is 
28km away to the north-west of the Project Site. There are no proposed SPA/ 
Ramsar Sites or candidate SACs in the vicinity of the Project Site.   
1.4.3 
The locations of the European Sites in relation to the Project Site are 
illustrated on Figure 1.  The study area for European sites was discussed and 
agreed during consultation with Natural England.  
1.5 
HRA process 
1.5.1 
A Habitats Regulations Assessment is a step-wise process involving a series 
of tests undertaken in a strict order so as to ensure a correct and robust 
determination that accords with the Regulations. The requirements of the 
Habitats Directive comprise four distinct stages:  
Stage 1: Screening is the process which initially identifies the likely 
impacts upon a European Site of a project or plan, either alone or in 
combination with other projects or plans, and considers whether these 
impacts may be significant. It is important to note that the burden of 
evidence is to show, on the basis of objective information, that there will 
be no significant effect; if the effect may be significant, or is not known, 
that would trigger the need for an Appropriate Assessment. There is 
European Court of Justice case law to the effect that unless the 
likelihood of a significant effect can be ruled out on the basis of 
objective information, then an Appropriate Assessment must be made.  
Stage 2: Appropriate Assessment is the detailed consideration of the 
impact on the integrity of the European Site of the project or plan, either 
alone or in combination with other projects or plans, with respect to the 
site’s conservation objectives and its structure and function.  This is to 
determine whether or not there will be adverse effects on the integrity of 
the site. This stage also includes the development of mitigation 
measures to avoid or reduce any possible impacts.   
Stage 3: Assessment of alternative solutions is the process which 
examines alternative ways of achieving the objectives of the project or 
plan that would avoid adverse impacts on the integrity of the European 
Site, should avoidance or mitigation measures associated with the 
proposed project be unable to cancel out adverse effects.  
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
7 
Stage 4: Assessment where no alternative solutions exist and where 
adverse impacts remain. Should no alternative solutions be available, 
at Stage 4 an assessment is made with regard to whether or not the 
development is necessary for imperative reasons of overriding public 
interest (IROPI) and, if so, of the compensatory measures needed to 
maintain the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network. 
1.5.2 
This HRA No Significant Effects Report (Stage 1) has assessed effects 
resulting from the Project in order to determine whether these are likely to 
result in a significant effect on any one of the European Sites in the vicinity of 
the Project Site. If the assessment concludes the Project is likely to have 
significant effects on a European site, the process of assessment will then 
progress to Stage 2 (Appropriate Assessment) to consider, in consultation with 
Natural England, whether the proposal will adversely affect the integrity of any 
one of the European Sites identified, either alone or in combination with other 
projects. However, if the assessment concludes the Project will have no likely 
significant effect(s) on the interest features of the European sites, no further 
HRA assessment is required, allowing the Project to proceed, subject to other 
relevant regulatory controls.

Description of European Sites 
 
2.1 
Chiltern Beechwoods SAC 
2.1.1 
Chiltern Beechwoods SAC supports a large area of ancient semi-natural 
beech forest and species-rich calcareous grassland and scrub mosaic.  It

Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA 
2.2.1 
The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA comprises an extensive area of 
disused sand and gravel pits adjacent to the River Nene in Northamptonshire.  
The shallow and deep open waters, marginal features, (including sparsely-
vegetated islands, gravel bars and shorelines) and other habitats (including 
reedswamp, marsh, wet ditches, rush pasture, rough grassland and scattered 
scrub) provide foraging and roosting habitat for assemblages of wetland birds 
of international importance during the non-breeding season. 
2.2.2 
The SPA qualifies under Article 4.1 of Directive 2009/147/EC as it is used 
regularly by 1% or more of the Great Britain populations of the Annex I

Screening 
3.1 
Methodology 
3.1.1 
European Commission guidance (2001)2 recommends that screening should 
fulfil the following steps:  
1. Determine whether the plan (or policy) is directly connected with or 
necessary for the management of Natura 2000 sites. 
2. Describe the plan and describe and characterise any other plans or 
projects which, in combination, have the potential for having significant 
effects on Natura 2000 sites.  
3. Identify the potential effects on Natura 2000 sites.  
4. Assess the likely significance of any effects on Natura 2000 sites.  
3.1.2 
The first part of the screening process therefore requires consideration of the 
project or plan in respect of whether it is directly connected with or necessary 
for the management of European Sites. ‘Directly’ in this context means solely 
conceived for the conservation management of a site and ‘management’ in 
this context refers to the management measures required in order to maintain 
in favourable condition the features for which the European Site has been 
designated. 
3.1.3 
The Project is not directly connected with, or necessary for, the management 
of Chiltern Beechwoods SAC or the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA or 
Ramsar Site.  
3.1.4 
The screening assessment for the Project, which addresses the other three 
steps of the process, is presented in matrix form in Section 3.2 (below).  In 
addition, screening matrices provided within the Planning Inspectorate Advice 
Note 10 are included as Appendix A1 to A3 of this NSER.   
3.1.5 
A critical part of the HRA screening process is determining whether or not the 
proposals are likely to have a significant effect on European Sites and, 
therefore, if they will require an Appropriate Assessment. Judgements 
regarding significance should be made in relation to the qualifying interests for 
which the site is of European importance and also its conservation objectives. 
A significant effect is defined as being any effect that would undermine the 
conservation objectives for a European site.

3.2 
Screening assessment 
3.2.1 
The Chiltern Beechwoods SAC is 27km from the Project Site and is the 
nearest European Site. It is separated from the Project Site by extensive areas 
of agricultural land, the M1 motorway and the urban areas of Dunstable and 
Luton. There are no watercourses or other natural features which directly 
connect the SAC to the Project Site.  
3.2.2 
The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and the Upper Nene Valley Gravel 
Pits Ramsar Site follow the same boundary.  The SPA and Ramsar Site are 
located approximately 28km to the north-west of the Project Site.  These sites 
are separated from the Project Site by the town of Bedford and other urban 
areas, the River Great Ouse, and extensive areas of agricultural land. 
3.2.3 
The consideration of potential impacts on Chiltern Beechwoods SAC, and 
Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and Ramsar Site, as a result of the 
Project, is detailed in the screening assessment in Table 4 below. 
Table 4: Consideration of impacts in the Screening Assessment 
Description of project 
Description of any likely direct, indirect or secondary impacts of the project (either alone or in 
combination with other plans or projects) on the European Site by virtue of: 
Size and scale 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away 
from the SAC, SPA and Ramsar Sites (which 
are located approximately 27km and 28km 
away, respectively), no impacts as a result of 
the scale and size of the Project are 
expected. 
The maximum area for the Generating 
Equipment Site will be 4 ha.  The equipment 
to be installed includes a gas turbine, an 
emission stack of up to 35m in height, 
buildings associated with operation and 
maintenance, and Gas and Electrical 
Connection infrastructure.  A temporary 
Laydown Area for the storage of plant and 
equipment during construction would also be 
provided adjacent to the Generating 
Equipment Site.  In addition, an existing 
access track will be upgraded to agricultural 
standard. 
Land take 
There will be no land-take in the SAC, SPA or 
Ramsar Site. 
Distance from the European Site or key 
features of the site (from Project boundary) 
Chiltern Beechwoods SAC is located 
approximately 27km to the south-west of the 
Project Site.  It is separated from the Project 
Site by extensive areas of agricultural land, 
the M1 motorway, a railway line, and the 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
13 
urban areas of Dunstable and Luton. 
The Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits SPA and 
the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Ramsar 
Site follow the same boundary.  The SPA and 
Ramsar Site are located approximately 28km 
to the north-west of the Project Site.  These 
sites are separated from the Project Site by 
the town of Bedford and other urban areas, 
the River Great Ouse, and extensive areas of 
agricultural land. 
Resource requirements (from the European 
Site or from areas in proximity to the site, 
where of relevance to consideration of 
impacts) 
No resource requirements from the SAC, SPA 
or Ramsar Site or in proximity to these sites 
are required. 
Emissions (e.g. polluted surface water runoff 
both soluble and insoluble pollutants, 
atmospheric pollution) 
An assessment of potential impacts on Air 
Quality as a result of the Project has been 
included as part of the Environmental Impact 
Assessment.  This included consideration of 
potential impacts on ecological receptors, 
including European Sites.  During this 
process, the potential for significant effects on 
the SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site was ‘scoped 
out’ of further assessment, in accordance with 
the Institute of Air Quality Management’s 
‘Guidance on the assessment of dust from 
demolition and construction’ (IAQM, 2016), 
and the Environment Agency’s ‘Air Emissions 
Risk Assessment for your Environmental 
Permit. Further information is provided in 
Section 6.6 of the PEIR for the Project.   
Under these guidelines, the screening 
distances for construction and 
decommissioning dust effects for ecological 
receptors are: 50m from the boundary of the 
site or 50m from the routes used by 
construction vehicles on the public highway, 
within 500m of the site entrance.  During 
Operation, the screening distance for 
European Sites, is 10 km from the 
approximate centre of the Generating 
Equipment Site.  As such, given that the SAC 
and SPA are located 27km and 28km away 
from the Project Site respectively, no 
significant effects as a result of the Project are 
expected. 
Even for those ecological receptors (that are 
not associated with the SAC, SPA or Ramsar 
Site) and which fall within the screening 
distances, the assessment concluded that the 
Project will not result in any likely significant 
effects in relation to air quality either as a 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
14 
standalone project or cumulatively with other 
projects.  Potential effects were identified as: 
‘Increase in NOx concentrations and nitrogen 
and acid deposition’ during operation and 
maintenance.  However, all of the predicted 
nitrogen and deposition rates are insignificant 
when compared to the critical loads for the 
habitats under consideration, and no specific 
mitigation is required. 
There are no water bodies which connect the 
Project Site with the SAC, SPA or Ramsar 
Site.  There are therefore no conceivable 
effect pathways via the water environment as 
a result of the Project.  [For those waterbodies 
located within and adjacent to the Project 
Site, a Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) will include best 
practice working methods to prevent water 
pollution; an outline CEMP will be  submitted 
alongside the ES as part of the DCO 
Application.  In addition, the most appropriate 
best practice crossing methods will be used 
for watercourses in the construction of the 
Gas and Electrical Connection.  Precautions 
will also be undertaken to ensure that silt 
laden runoff, arisings or chemicals are not 
allowed to enter watercourses.] 
Excavation requirements (e.g. impacts on 
local hydrogeology) 
There are no excavation requirements within 
the SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site.  All excavation 
works that are required (detailed below) are 
confined within the Project Site, which is 
located approximately 27km and 28km away 
from the SAC and SPA/ Ramsar Site 
respectively.  There are therefore no 
conceivable effect pathways due to 
excavations as a result of the Project. 
To facilitate the proposed Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) of The Rookery, 
extraction of clay from a currently un-worked 
area situated directly to the south of the 
existing extent of Rookery South Pit will be 
undertaken.  These works will be completed 
prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project. 
During the construction period for the Project, 
excavation works will be undertaken within 
the Project Site for: plant and building 
foundations, underground services, cable 
draw pits, site roads, and gas pipeline 
trenches.  During construction of the Gas and 
Electrical Connection, best practice working 
methods will be utilised at all watercourse 
crossings to ensure that there are no adverse 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
15 
impacts on flow or drainage and that no 
contamination is allowed to enter waterbodies 
within the vicinity of the Project Site. 
The CEMP will include best practice working 
methods to prevent pollution to the ground 
and ground water; an outline CEMP will be 
provided with the ES and submitted with the 
DCO Application.  
Transportation requirements 
There are no conceivable impacts on the 
SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site as a result of 
transportation requirements. 
No ‘affected roads’ have been identified in 
accordance with criteria in the Department for 
Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and 
Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 Section 3, Part 1: 
Air Quality’, as a result of the Project.  An 
‘affected road’ is defined as a road where: 
• 
Road alignment will change by 5 m or 
more; or 
• 
Daily traffic flows will change by 1,000 or 
more; or 
• 
Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) flows will 
change by 200 AADT or more; or 
• 
Daily average speed will change by 10 
km/hr or more; or 
• 
Peak hour speed will change by 20 km/hr 
or more. 
The potential for significant effects due to 
vehicle emissions has therefore been scoped 
out of the assessment; see Section 6.7 of the 
PEIR for the Project. 
A Construction Traffic Management Plan 
(CTMP) will be prepared by the Contractors 
prior to construction.  This plan will contain 
information such as timing and routing of 
traffic.  
Duration of construction, operation, etc. 
The total construction programme will be 
approximately 22 months, with a start date of 
2020 and an end date of 2022.  The 
operational life of the Power Generation Plant 
will be 25 years.   
The decommissioning phase will be similar in 
duration to the construction phase.  The 
Generating Equipment will be

16 
decommissioned and removed at the end of 
its operational life.  The Gas Pipeline will be 
made safe and left in situ. 
Other  
None 
Description of avoidance and/ or mitigation measures 
Nature of proposals 
No impacts have been identified on the SAC, 
SPA or Ramsar Site as a result of the Project, 
so there is no requirement for specific 
avoidance or mitigation measures.  
In any event, a CEMP will be produced by the 
Contractor prior to the start of construction to 
ensure that best practice working methods 
are implemented to avoid potential pollution 
events in the local environment. 
Location 
None required (no impacts identified). 
Evidence for effectiveness 
None required (no impacts identified). 
Mechanism for delivery 
None required (no impacts identified). 
Assessment Criteria 
Individual elements of the project (either alone or in combination with other plans or projects) 
likely to give rise to impacts on the European Site: 
The Project comprises a new Power Generating Plant and associated Gas and Electrical 
Connections.  The Project involves the potential generation of dust during construction, 
emissions to air during operation, construction site noise, operational noise, and the potential 
for incidental pollution/ siltation of surface and ground water.  The following other projects are 
located within the vicinity of the Project Site: 
• 
Covanta RRF Project - immediately adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site; 
• 
Integrated Waste Management Operations at Rookery South - immediately adjacent 
to the Generating Equipment Site; 
• 
land at Moreteyne Farm at Wood End in Marston Moretaine proposed for residential 
properties – 2km west of the Project Site; 
• 
land at Warrant Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill proposed for residential properties 
– 3.5km south of Gas Connection AGI; 
• 
land East and West of Broadmead Road, Stewartby proposed for residential 
properties (under construction) – 500m north of closest point of the Access Road; and 
• 
new settlement at Wixams (under construction) – 5km north-east of closest point of 
Access Road. 
• 
Land off Marston Road, Lidlington – proposed residential development of 31 dwellings 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
17 
- approximately 2km west of Electrical Connection; 
• 
Land opposite The Lane & Lombard Street, East of Marston Road, Lidlington – 
proposed residential development of 40 dwellings approximately 2km west of 
Electrical Connection; 
• 
Lower Shelton Road, Marston Moretaine - proposed residential development of 15 
dwellings approximately 4km north of Access Road; 
• 
Land to the rear of Cowlgrove Parade, Steppingley Road, Flitwick – Multi-storey car 
park to provide 232 parking spaces – approximately 4km south of Gas Connection; 
• 
Land East of Ampthill Road and North of Bedford Road, Houghton Conquest - 
proposed mixed use development including 650 dwellings approximately 4km north-
east of Generating Facility; 
• 
Land off Chapel End Road, Houghton Conquest – proposed residential development 
of 125 dwellings approximately 4km north-east of Generating Facility; and  
• 
Land South of Fields Road and East of Cranfield Road, Wootton – proposed 
residential development of 600 dwellings – approximately 5k north of Access Road. 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site 
(approximately 27km and 28km respectively), and given the lack of effect pathways via the 
water environment; these elements of the Project (either alone or in combination with the other 
projects listed above) are not likely to give rise to impacts on the European Sites. 
Likely changes to the site arising as a result of: 
Reduction in habitat area 
None – due to the distance away from the 
Project Site, there will be no direct impacts on 
habitats in the SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site.  No 
indirect impacts on habitats within the 
European Sites (such as through effects on 
water or air quality) have been identified. 
Disturbance to key species 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away 
from the SAC, SPA and Ramsar Sites (which 
are located approximately 27km and 28km 
away, respectively), no disturbance to key 
species as a result of noise and vibration is 
expected. 
In any case, all construction activities will be 
undertaken in accordance with requirements 
attached to the DCO and the 
recommendations of BS 5228 ‘Noise and 
Vibration Control on Construction and Open 
Sites’. 
Habitats or species fragmentation 
None – the Project will not fragment (either 
directly or indirectly) any habitat features, 
which connect the European Sites with the 
wider environment. 
HRA: No Signficant Effects Report 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
18 
Reduction in species density 
None – the Project will not affect (either 
directly or indirectly) the availability of 
resources within the SAC, SPA or Ramsar 
Site.  Due to the distance away from the 
Project Site, no disturbance effects have been 
identified. 
Changes in key indicators of conservation 
value (water quality etc.) 
None – there are therefore no conceivable 
effect pathways via the water environment as 
a result of the Project.  The potential for 
significant effects associated with air quality in 
the SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site has been 
scoped out of the assessment.  Due to the 
distance away from the Project Site, there will 
be no direct impacts on habitats in the SAC, 
SPA or Ramsar Site. 
Climate change 
None – no direct or indirect impacts on the 
SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site have been 
identified.  The Project will not fragment any 
habitat features, which connect the European 
Sites with the wider environment; and will not 
result in any changes in local hydrology or air 
quality. 
Likely impacts on the European Site as a whole in terms of: 
Interference with the key relationships that 
define the structure of the site 
None. 
The Project will not fragment any habitat 
features, which connect the European Sites 
with the wider environment; will not result in 
any changes in local hydrology or air quality. 
Interference with the key relationships that 
define the function of the site 
None. 
The Project will not fragment any habitat 
features, which connect the European Sites 
with the wider environment; will not result in 
any changes in local hydrology or air quality. 
Significance of the impacts set out above:

Describe from the above those elements of the project, or combination of elements, where the 
above impacts are likely to be significant or where the scale or magnitude of impacts is not 
known. 
Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site 
(approximately 27km and 28km respectively), and given the lack of conceivable effect 
pathways via the water environment; there are no elements of the Project, or combination of 
elements, which are likely to result in impacts on the European Sites. 
Outcome of screening stage 
Not likely to be significant effects. 
Are the appropriate statutory environmental 
bodies in agreement with this conclusion 
Yes (see correspondence in Appendix B).

Outcome 
4.1.1 
There will be no loss or fragmentation of habitat within or associated with the 
SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site, or deterioration in habitat quality as a result of the 
Project. There will be no disturbance to habitats or species for which the SAC, 
SPA or Ramsar Site is designated, and no reduction in species density is 
anticipated.   
4.1.2 
Neither the construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project will 
interfere with any of the key relationships that define the structure or function 
of the SAC, SPA or Ramsar Site, as none of the habitats or species will be 
directly or indirectly affected.  
4.1.3 
Based on the results of the screening exercise the Project will not result in any 
likely significant effects on Chiltern Beechwoods SAC, Upper Nene Valley 
Gravel Pits SPA, or Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Ramsar Site, and no 
scientific doubt remains.   
4.1.4 
There are no likely significant effects on the European sites, either alone or in 
combination with other plans or projects and no scientific doubt remains.  On 
this basis no further assessment in the form of an Appropriate Assessment 
(Stage 2) is necessary (in accordance with PINs Advice note 10).   
4.1.5 
Consultation was undertaken with Natural England as part of the 2014 PEIR 
and agreement reached with the findings of this assessment, that no likely 
significant effects on any European Sites are anticipated as a result of the 
Project (see Appendix B Correspondence with Natural England).  Natural 
England will be consulted again to confirm that they are still in agreement. 
This agreement will be included in the Statement of Common Ground, to be 
submitted as part of the DCO application.

Evidence supporting conclusions 
a. Please see Chapter 3 of this No Significant Effects Report.  There will be no land-take, no resource requirements and no 
excavation works within the boundary of the designated site.  Due to the distance of the Project Site away from the SAC, no 
impacts on air quality are anticipated, in accordance with statutory guidelines.  There are no water bodies which connect the 
Project Site with the SAC, and there are therefore no conceivable effect pathways via the water environment as a result of the 
Project.  The Project will not fragment any habitat features, which connect the SAC with the wider environment.

Dear Nick 
 
To confirm I am in agreement with the conclusions of the No Significant Effects Report provided; i.e. that there would 
be no likely significant effects to any European Site, either alone or in combination with other plans or projects, from 
the Millbrook Power project. 
 
Kind regards, Ross

Ross, 
 
We are aiming to submit our DCO application in early March and would very much appreciate any comments on the 
attached No Significant Effects Report. I believe Elaine Richmond, our ecologist at PBA, has been in close contact 
with NE throughout the process of preparing our documents so I don’t think there will be anything new here. 
 
I very much look forward to hearing from you shortly, 
 
Best regards, 
Nick

John, 
 
Just wanted to give you a quick update now that we have some more detail regarding the PINS outreach 
meeting. It will be held between 11:30 and 13:00 on Wednesday 26th November at the Marston Vale 
Forest Centre near Marston Moretaine. 
 
It will include a brief update from MPL and summary of our consultation responses, followed by a 
presentation from PINS outlining how the pre-application and examination phase of a DCO application 
work. Please could you let me know if you are available to attend.
