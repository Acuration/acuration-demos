Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014) identified records of a number of 
bat species within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary, as defined at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the 
‘Survey Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake surveys for bats within the 150 ha of 
pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm between April and October 2014 within the Survey 
Site, as part of a range of ecological surveys to inform and support an application for Development 
Consent for the Project. 
1.3 
A range of surveys were carried out in accordance with published best-practice guidance focusing 
on investigating the distribution and variety of bat species present within the Survey Site. These 
included; walked transects, automated bat detector surveys, and internal and external inspections 
of trees and buildings. 
1.4 
At least seven species of bats were recorded during transect surveys; common pipistrelle 
Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Myotis sp., long-eared bat 
Plecotus sp., noctule Nyctalus noctula, Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri, and lesser horseshoe bat 
Rhinolophus hipposideros. All of these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated bat detector surveys; Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, serotine Eptesicus 
serotinus, and greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. By far the most frequently 
recorded species were common and soprano pipistrelle with 90 % of calls identified as one or other 
of these two species. Myotis sp. bats were also recorded frequently with noctule recorded 
infrequently but regularly. The six other species of bats were recorded occasionally or singly. 
1.5 
Roost surveys of buildings within the Survey Site confirmed that at least three buildings contained 
bat droppings and were used as bat roosts. Droppings from at least three species of bats 
(pipistrelle sp., long-eared bat sp. and lesser horseshoe bat) were found. Thirty three trees were 
located within the Survey Site that are thought to have potential to support roosting bats. 
Emergence and / or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight trees all of which would potentially 
be directly affected by the Project.  No bats were recorded emerging from or entering these 
potential tree roosts.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake surveys for bats between April 
and October 2014 as part of a suite of ecological surveys to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site and comprise a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including bat surveys. These 
baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental 
Statement, which is intended for submission in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the bat surveys within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Identify the bat species using the Survey Site and the activity levels of bats within the Survey 
Site; 
 
Identify whether there are any features that are capable of supporting roosting bats; and 
 
If the above features are likely to be affected by the Project, establish whether they are used by 
roosting bats.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected1 species, including bats, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up 
to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary.  
Site Appraisal  
3.2 
The areas of marshy grassland, trees, scrub, woodland and streams within the Survey Site 
potentially provide good foraging habitat for bats, with similar habitat present in the surrounding 
landscape providing habitat continuity and connectivity throughout the landscape. The desk study 
returned records of five species of bats, which are all fairly common and widespread. In addition, 
the Survey Site has habitat that is capable of supporting roosting and foraging habitat for rarer 
species of bat that have been recorded in the Swansea area, for example lesser horseshoe bat, 
greater horseshoe bat and barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus.  
3.3 
Overall, the Survey Site has been assessed as being of ‘Medium Habitat Quality’ following 
consideration of the current best practice bat survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Therefore the 
following methods were used at the appropriate level of survey effort, as recommended by the 
guidelines: 
 
Walked transects; and  
 
Automated detector surveys.   
3.4 
In addition, a number of buildings and trees within the Survey Site were surveyed for presence / 
likely absence of roosting bats. The following methods were used: 
 
Internal and external building inspection or tree roost climbing inspection; and 
 
Dusk emergence and pre-dawn re-entry surveys of potential roosts that are likely to be 
affected by the Project.  
Bat Activity Surveys 
Walked Transects 
3.5 
Walked surveys of two pre-determined transect routes (northern and southern, see Figure 1) were 
undertaken monthly between April and October 2014.  The pre-determined transect routes were 
largely contained within the Survey Site, with the southern route extending a short distance to the 
east of the Survey Site in one area.  
3.6 
Each transect started around sunset and took approximately 2-3 hours to complete. The timing of 
the surveys therefore covered the bat emergence period and the period of most intense foraging 
activity when invertebrate prey is most abundant (Altringham, 2003).   
3.7 
The same transect route was walked on each survey visit with the start points and direction 
changed on each visit to ensure that different parts of the Survey Site were surveyed at different 
times of the night. This approach was adopted to remove any bias that could be introduced into the 
survey data if each survey was walked in the same direction. This bias could otherwise have 
resulted in any given point on the transect route being visited at approximately the same interval 
after sunset.  Static recording points were selected for each transect.  At these points the surveyors 
were stationary for three minutes to listen and record all bat passes. 
3.8 
Bat activity was recorded using Anabat hand-held electronic bat detectors. This model of detector 
automatically records all the bat passes they detect, which significantly reduces the chances that

bats could be missed due to human error. Wherever possible, surveyors recorded the observed 
behaviour and numbers of bats onto a field proforma. This was to aid identification and also to 
provide additional detail on the behaviour of observed bats. Field notes included a record of the 
time of each bat encounter, allowing results to be cross-referenced with the recorded data. 
3.9 
The main aim of the transect walks was to identify areas of high bat activity, such as foraging areas 
and/or commuting routes (e.g. wet ditches, marshy grassland and hedgerows). Accordingly, the 
transect routes focussed on such areas. 
3.10 
When possible, all walked transects avoided heavy rain, strong winds and dusk temperatures 
below 10°C as recommended in the BCT guidelines (Hundt, 2012).  
Automated detector surveys 
3.11 
In addition to the transect surveys, automated surveys were conducted using Wildlife Acoustics 
Song Meter 2 (SM2BAT+) bat detectors which are full spectrum detectors that are triggered 
automatically to record bat echolocation calls.  These detectors can be deployed and left to 
remotely record bat activity for a period of several nights. 
3.12 
The BCT guidance recommends that two locations per transect route are surveyed each month. In 
this case, eight survey locations were used across the Survey Site with four in each half of the 
Survey Site (north and south). Each location was surveyed every other month to enable a larger 
number of survey locations to be sampled over the survey season but ensure that each location 
was sampled in spring, summer and autumn. Bat detectors would be deployed at four locations 
(two in the north and two in the south) in April, June, August and October with the other half of the 
locations sampled in May, July and September.  
3.13 
The detectors were deployed for five nights at each of the locations, which allowed continuous 
monitoring to take place during the period when bats are active, i.e. sunset to sunrise. They were 
programmed to begin recording from half an hour before sunset until half an hour after sunrise.  
Survey hours varied throughout the survey season according to daylight hours and have been 
calculated for each recording session in order to accurately calculate activity indices.  
Materials and Data Analysis 
Full details of the equipment used for surveys and the data analysis methods are provided in 
Appendix 2. 
Bat Roost Surveys 
Internal and External Building Inspection 
3.14 
The internal/external survey of eleven buildings within the Survey Site was undertaken on 25th June 
2014 by Principal Ecologist and experienced bat worker Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM (Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW) Licence number 52240:OTH:CSAB:2014) with assistance from Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. Eleven buildings (Buildings B1 – B11) (see Figure 2, 
Appendix 1) were inspected to assess their potential to support roosting bats and to search for 
evidence of bat activity.  
3.15 
The survey included all the buildings within the Survey Site, except for those contained within the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site, which were visually inspected using binoculars from 
boundary fences during the PEA survey in July. The buildings within these sites do not apparently 
have any features that could support roosting bats and it was not necessary to arrange access to 
these sites to carry out a more detailed inspection of any of the buildings.  
3.16 
During the survey a thorough search was made of the buildings including all accessible areas and 
crevices for bats, their droppings, food remains or characteristic grease marks at potential roost 
exit/entrance points.  The exterior of the buildings were searched, paying particular attention to 
window ledges, where droppings can gather undisturbed, and under potential roost access points, 
such as loose tiles and gaps between boarding. Where possible, internal inspections were also 
undertaken.

3.17 
Signs of bat activity searched for included: 
 
Live bats; 
 
Droppings; 
 
Urine staining; 
 
Feeding remains (e.g. discarded wings of flying invertebrates); 
 
Oil staining; 
 
Smell; 
 
Daytime vocalisations; 
 
Absence of cobwebs (a well-used bat roost and its access points are typically clear of 
cobwebs); 
 
Scratching; and 
 
Dead bats.  
3.18 
All buildings were assigned a category defining their potential to support roosting bats in 
accordance with Table 1 below. 
Table 1: Categories defining the potential for buildings to support roosting bats. 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
Negligible  
Building with no or very limited roosting opportunities for bats, no 
evidence of use by bats and where the feature is isolated from foraging 
habitat. 
Low  
Building with a limited number of roosting opportunities, no evidence of 
current use by bats and with poor connectivity to foraging habitat. 
Medium  
Building with some roosting opportunities, with no evidence of current 
use by bats and with connectivity to moderate – high quality foraging 
habitat. 
High  
Building with multiple roosting opportunities for one or more species of 
bat, and with good connectivity to high quality foraging habitat. 
Confirmed Roost 
Presence of bats or evidence of recent use by bats. 
Internal and External Tree Inspection 
Preliminary Ground Level Inspection of Trees 
3.19 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal conducted (on 24 February, 14 April and 9 July 2014) 
included a preliminary ground-level assessment of trees for their potential to support roosting bats. 
Features of trees that may be used by roosting bats include: 
 
Natural holes; 
 
Woodpecker holes; 
 
Cracks or splits in major limbs; 
 
Loose bark; and 
 
Hollows or cavities. 
3.20 
Any trees with apparent roosting features were recorded and assigned a category defining their 
potential to support roosting bats in accordance with Table 2 below, as adapted from Hundt, 2012 
(Table 8.4, p. 60). The locations of these trees are shown in Figure 3a, Appendix 1.

10/03/2015 
Table 2: Categories defining the potential for trees to support roosting bats. 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
1* 
Trees with multiple, highly suitable features capable of supporting larger 
roosts. 
1 
Trees with definite bat potential, supporting fewer suitable features than 
category 1* trees or with potential for use by single bats. 
2 
Trees with no obvious potential, although the tree is of a size and age 
that elevated surveys may result in cracks or crevices being found; or 
the tree supports some features which may have limited potential to 
support bats. 
3 
Trees with no potential to support roosting bats.  
Roped Access Survey of Trees 
3.21 
Any trees that were identified during the Phase 1 survey as category 2 or above, i.e. have potential 
to support roosting bats were further assessed by Anton Kattan2 and Ted Bodsworth, during a 
roped access (or tree climbing) survey. The aim of this survey was to closely inspect features 
identified during the Phase 1 survey and re-categorise trees as necessary. The trees were 
surveyed from 15-17 July 2014. Weather conditions during the three day period were generally 
good with light rain on 16 July 2014.  
Dusk emergence and Dawn Re-entry Surveys 
3.22 
Following on from the internal and external inspections described above, dusk emergence and 
dawn re-entry surveys were undertaken between 12 and 28 August 2014. The survey was 
undertaken in a smaller area than the Survey Site described above; due to refinements in the 
Project design and extent of the Project Site which assisted in determining which potential roosts 
would be affected by the Project and, therefore, would require further survey. A plan of the reduced 
area was provided on 8 August 2014 and the trees within this reduced area, along with their roost 
potential categorisation are shown in Figure 3b, Appendix 1. No buildings are anticipated to be 
directly affected by the Project, and therefore all the buildings were excluded from further surveys. 
The recommendations included in the BCT guidance (Hundt, 2012) for the level of survey effort 
required to determine the presence or absence of bats from a structure are shown in Table 3.  
Table 3: Survey effort required for determining presence / absence of bats at a potential roost 
Level of bat potential 
Survey effort required 
High roost potential 
3 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September including 2 
between mid-May and August. 
Low to moderate roost potential 
2 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September including 2 
between mid-May and August. 
Low roost potential 
1 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September. 
3.23 
The roped access surveys are considered equal effort to one emergence or re-entry survey, 
therefore reducing the number of further activity surveys by one. The tree categories were split into 
the three roost potential categories as follows: 1* - high roost potential; 1 – low to moderate 
potential; 2 – low roost potential; and 3 – no roost potential. Table 4 shows the additional activity 
surveys required on each of the trees. Where it was not possible to carry out a roped access 
survey on the trees within the reduced area, namely T5, T32 and T35, an additional emergence or 
re-entry survey was carried out.

The dusk emergence surveys commenced approximately 15 - 30 minutes before sunset and 
continued until approximately 1½ - 2 hours after sunset. The dawn re-entry survey commenced 
approximately 1½ - 2 hours before sunrise and finished 15 minutes after sunrise. 
3.25 
Surveyors used two different bat detectors on each survey to supplement visual observations: a 
Batbox Duet detector for listening to bat calls from the combined heterodyne/frequency division 
output and an Anabat frequency division detector for recording calls for subsequent identification. 
Limitations of Study Methods 
3.26 
No significant limitations to the study methods were noted. The access route in the south-west of 
the Survey Site (Access Road Option 2) and the western part of the land surrounding the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations were not included 
in the transect surveys as access to these areas could not be arranged until late in June and was 
not permitted at night for security reasons. This area is a small proportion of the Survey Site that 
does not contain habitats significantly different to those present in other parts of the Survey Site, 
and is unlikely to support a more diverse species assemblage than the rest of the Survey Site. As 
such, it is not considered that this is a significant limitation to the survey methods. 
3.27 
No access was granted to the roof voids of the three residential buildings (buildings 1, 2, and 5 – 
see Table 12) surveyed for roosting bats. This limitation to the survey is unlikely to be significant 
given that these buildings will not be directly affected by the Project.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site’ in the records which was located 
approximately 1 km to the south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.2 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule, and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. 
There were also records of unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and other records where the bat species 
was not specified. 
4.3 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.

There were 43 Pipistrelle sp. passes recorded during the walked transect that could not be 
identified to species level, as the peak frequency of the calls were within a frequency range used 
by more than one species (see ‘Materials and Data Analysis’ in Appendix 2 for details of how 
pipistrelle bats were identified). These have not been included in the results tables.  
4.7 
A total of 464 bat passes (B) were recorded during the north transect, including at least five 
species, a total of 494 bat passes were recorded during the south transect, including at least seven 
species. The relative activity level (Bat passes per hour (B/h) for the definition of B and B/h used in 
this analysis see ‘Materials and Data Analysis’ in Appendix 2) recorded during the north and south 
transects is recorded in Table 7.

Relative Activity of Bats 
4.8 
Across the survey season, common pipistrelle was the most frequently encountered species during 
walked transects with 15.4 B/h and 60.2 % of all passes recorded as this species (B = 577).  
Soprano pipistrelle was the second most numerous with 6.4 B/h. When passes from unidentified 
pipistrelles are added to the total, 89.8 % of all the recorded passes were identified as bats from 
the Pipistrellus genus4. Activity levels of 1.8 B/h and 0.7 B/h were recorded for Myotis sp. and 
noctule respectively with one pass recorded for Leisler’s bat, lesser horseshoe bat and long-eared 
bat sp.  
4.9 
Bat activity levels varied between transects, with a mean of 26.1 B/h (range; 7.3–70.4 B/h). 
Fluctuations between surveys are within normal limits, being influenced by factors such as short-
term variations in weather conditions and prey availability and seasonal variations.  During April, an 
average across both surveys of 49.8 B/h was recorded, which then declined in May to 22.3 B/h and 
in June (14.4 B/h) and then rose again in July (36.5 B/h). In the autumn bat activity declined again 
with an average of 24.2 B/h recorded in September, which dropped again in October (12.2 B/h). 
The highest level of activity recorded during a single transect survey occurred during the April 
transect in SA2 when an activity rate of 70.4 B/h (B = 176) was recorded. 
Spatial Distribution of Bats 
4.10 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded during every survey and occurred in most of 
the Survey Site. The highest number of passes was recorded along linear features such as hedges 
or streams, with lower activity over open fields. Passes were recorded throughout transect surveys, 
with the majority being recorded later in the night; however, 12 passes were recorded within 20 
minutes of sunset. 
4.11 
A total of 67 passes of Myotis bats were recorded, with a relatively wide scatter of records 
throughout the Survey Site. The highest proportion of passes was recorded along the stream to the 
east and woodlands in the south of the Survey Site. No passes were recorded within 20 minutes of 
sunset. 
4.12 
Noctule was recorded infrequently and in low numbers with just 26 passes recorded. Most passes 
were recorded during the southern transect, with single passes scattered throughout the Survey 
Site.  Twelve of the passes recorded were within the first 20 minutes after sunset. 
4.13 
One pass of lesser horseshoe bat was recorded on 3 June near the woodland at the north corner 
of the National Grid gas compressor station. This was recorded 67 minutes after sunset. 
Automated Detector Surveys 
4.14 
Automated bat detectors were operating for a total of 132 nights, equating to 1,266 hours and 50 
minutes of survey time between April and October 2014. Table 8 gives details of automated bat 
detector deployment dates and locations with the latter illustrated in Figure 1, Appendix 1. Table 9

Relative Activity of Bats 
4.15 
A total of 27,634 passes from at least ten species of bat were recorded. Figure 6 illustrates the 
proportion of activity recorded for different species at each automated survey location, for the 
whole survey period as well as spring (April-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-
October) in Figures 7 to 9. Data for bats not identified to species-level (e.g. common/soprano 
pipistrelle), or for which there were so few calls recorded that the activity rate cannot be 
meaningfully illustrated (e.g. greater and lesser horseshoe bat), have not been illustrated in the 
Figures provided in Appendix 1. The relative activity of bat species recorded at all detector 
locations is recorded in Table 10.

Across the survey season, the highest relative activity rate recorded was for common pipistrelle, at 
an average of 14.2 B/h (B = 17975) followed by soprano pipistrelle (4.8 B/h) with 90.0% of all the 
recorded passes identified as bats from the Pipistrellus genus. The next most frequently recorded 
species were Myotis sp. with 1.8 B/h (B = 2328) and noctule (0.2 B/h). There were also 45 long-
eared bat Plecotus sp. passes recorded, with six passes for lesser horseshoe bat, two for greater 
horseshoe bat, three for serotine Eptesicus serotinus and just one Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
nathusii pass.  
4.17 
The data presented in Table 11 indicates that overall bat activity dropped from spring (April and 
May; 43.0 B/h) to summer (June - August; 19.1 B/h) and again in autumn (September and October 
11.4 B/h). The pattern of activity was the same for all species of bats except long-eared bat sp. 
which increased from <0.1 to 0.1 B/h from spring to summer, and serotine and Nathusius’ 
pipistrelle which were only recorded in the spring and autumn respectively.

Distribution of Bats 
4.20 
The highest activity levels came from three detectors that each recorded 29.9-35.7 B/h as follows: 
 
D5 (29.9 B/h) - located at the corner of a patch of woodland to the west of the Survey Site. 
The large majority of passes were from common pipistrelle bats (20.7 B/h). Two of the six 
lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded at this location, as was one of two greater 
horseshoe bat passes. The highest Myotis activity (5.0 B/h) was recorded at this location. 
 
D4 (30.5 B/h) - located at the south corner of the Survey Site in trees along a stream corridor. 
High activity levels of common (13.4 B/h) and soprano (13.0 B/h) pipistrelle bats were 
recorded, as well as two of the six lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded at this location. 
 
D8 (35.7 B/h) – located on the corner of woodland surrounding the National Grid Gas 
compressor station to the west of the Survey Site. High levels of activity were recorded from 
common (22.7 B/h) and soprano (9.5 B/h) pipistrelle bats. One of two greater horseshoe bat 
passes was recorded. 
Myotis bats 
4.21 
In total, 2,328 Myotis sp. passes were recorded at an average rate of 1.8 B/h. Myotis bats were 
recorded at all of the static locations and during every deployment. Higher activity rates were 
recorded in the spring (4.0 B/h) than the summer (0.9 B/h) with a slight increase again in autumn 
(1.4 B/h). 
4.22 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the south of the Survey Site than the north (2.8 B/h and 
1.0 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity was recorded at D5 (5.0 B/h), in the most 
southerly part of the Survey Site. 
4.23 
The nocturnal activity of Myotis bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 40 minutes after sunset, with a peak around one hour after sunset and 
consistent activity throughout the night until around 40 minutes before sunrise. 
 
 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Bat Survey Report

10/03/2015 
Noctule bats 
4.24 
In total, 228 Noctule passes were recorded at an average rate of 0.2 B/h. Noctule bats were 
recorded at all of the static locations. Higher activity rates were recorded in the spring (0.5 B/h) 
which then dropped away during the summer (0.1 B/h) with a further drop in autumn (<0.1 B/h). 
4.25 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the south of the Survey Site compared to the north (0.2 
B/h and 0.2 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity was recorded at D3 and D6 (0.3 B/h), 
along the eastern side of the Survey Site. 
4.26 
The nocturnal activity of Noctule bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 20 minutes after sunset, with three calls in total recorded before sunset, and a 
peak in activity around 40 minutes after sunset followed by consistently low activity throughout the 
night until around 20 minutes before sunrise. 
Leisler’s and Serotine bats 
4.27 
In total four Leisler’s bat and three serotine bat passes were recorded on the Survey Site, with an 
additional 24 passes that were identified as either Leisler’s bat or serotine.  
4.28 
Leisler’s bat passes were recorded at detector numbers D5 and D6, in the west and north-east of 
the Survey Site respectively. Serotine passes were recorded at detectors D3 and D8, in the 
woodland in the east of the Survey Site and the woodland around the Gas Compressor Station in 
the west respectively. All passes of Leisler’s bat / serotine occurred at detector D8.  
4.29 
All of the bat passes were recorded within the first 60 minutes after sunset with the exception of 
one Leisler’s bat pass and one Leisler’s bat / serotine pass which were both recorded in the middle 
of the night.  
Pipistrelle bats 
4.30 
This section covers common, soprano and Nathusius’ pipistrelles and also any pipistrelle calls that 
could have been from either species (see Appendix 2). In total, 17,975 common pipistrelle passes 
were recorded (14.2 B/h), with 6,019 soprano pipistrelle (4.8 B/h), and a total of 772 unidentified 
pipistrelle passes (0.6 B/h); 97% of all pipistrelle calls were therefore recorded to species level. 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded from all detectors during every deployment. 
Much higher activity rates were recorded for common pipistrelle in the spring (29.6 B/h) than the 
summer (12.2 B/h) and autumn (11.4 B/h). This was also true for soprano pipistrelle, with 7.4 B/h in 
spring, 5.3 B/h in summer and 2.7 B/h in autumn. Only one Nathusius’ pipistrelle pass was 
recorded, during the autumn at D8 (in the south east of the Survey Site). 
4.31 
Higher levels of common and soprano pipistrelle activity were recorded in the south of the Survey 
Site than the north (25.5 B/h and 12.9 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity for common 
pipistrelle was recorded at D8 (22.7 B/h). For soprano pipistrelle highest relative activity was at D4 
(13.0 B/h), the only location at which soprano pipistrelle levels nearly matched common pipistrelle, 
along the eastern side of the Survey Site. 
4.32 
The nocturnal activity of pipistrelle bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 20 minutes after sunset, with a peak from 40 to 80 minutes after sunset. There 
was constant activity recorded throughout the night until around 20 minutes before sunrise, with a 
secondary peak around 60 to 40 minutes before sunrise. 
Long-eared bat sp. 
4.33 
In total, 45 long-eared bat sp. passes were recorded at an average rate of 0.04 B/h. Long-eared 
bat sp. were recorded at low levels at all of static locations, with a peak activity level of 0.1 B/h at 
D1. A higher number of passes were recorded in the summer (31 passes) than the autumn (13 
passes) and the spring when only one pass was recorded. 
4.34 
Long-eared bat sp. was recorded at all detectors with peak activity levels at D1 and D3, both on the 
western side of the Survey Site next to woodland.

Six lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded across four detector locations, D3, D4, D5 and D7, 
located in the centre of the Survey Site. Four of these passes were recorded in spring, with one in 
the summer and one in autumn. A single pass was recorded from D3 on 18 June, with two passes 
recorded from D4 on 25 April, single passes recorded on 18 and 19 May from D5 and a further 
single pass recorded at D7 on 20 September. Bat passes were recorded between 1-1.5 hours after 
sunset or 55 minutes – 1.5 hrs before sunrise in spring and summer, and in the middle of the night 
(23:45) in autumn.  
4.36 
Two greater horseshoe bat passes were recorded at detector locations D5 and D8 during the 
middle of the night in July and September respectively.  
Bat Roost Surveys 
Internal and External Building Inspection 
4.37 
The results of the building inspection are included in Table 12, which shows the category assigned 
to each building. Full descriptions of the buildings are included in Appendix 3 and Photographs of 
each building in Appendix 4.

Derelict stone cottage, 
two distinct standing 
walls, no roof.  
Walls are very exposed. Some roosting 
opportunities between the stone, and 
gaps into a rubble filled wall. No signs of 
use by bats were observed.  
4.38 
None of the buildings will be affected by the Project and therefore no further survey has been 
carried out on the buildings.  
Internal and External Tree Inspection 
Preliminary Ground Level Inspection of Trees 
4.39 
A total of 33 trees were identified during the preliminary ground level inspection of trees as having 
potential bat roosting features. The details of each tree are recorded in Table 13 below with their 
locations shown in Figure 3a, Appendix 1.  
4.40 
All but four of the trees that were identified were further assessed during the roped access survey 
(see below). 
Roped Access Survey of Trees 
4.41 
A total of 29 trees were climbed using ladders or rope access. Four trees were inaccessible or 
unsafe to climb. Table 13 includes descriptions of the potential roosting features and the BCT 
category (see Table 1) assigned to each tree following the roped access survey.

Appendix 2: Materials and Data Analysis 
Use of Bat Detectors 
The bat detectors used for automated surveys were Wildlife Acoustics SM2Bat and SM2Bat+. These are 16-
bit full-spectrum bat detectors with internal storage and computing power that allows the unit to be used as a 
remote fixed-point detector. Recording is triggered by ultrasound, such as bat calls, in the vicinity of the 
detector, and any bat calls are stored as sound files on an internal SD card.  
SM2 detectors were placed in water-proof boxes connected by a 10 m cable to an omnidirectional Wildlife 
Acoustics SMX-US microphone. The microphones were attached to a telescopic pole at 3.5 m above ground 
level on, and angled at 45° to the ground to allow water to run off, as recommended by the manufacturers.  
For walked transect surveys and emergence/re-entry surveys, surveyors used two different bat detectors on 
each survey to supplement visual observations: a Batbox Duet detector for listening to bat calls from the 
combined heterodyne/frequency division output and an Anabat (SD1 or SD2) detector or Wildlife Acoustics 
Echo Meter 3 (EM3) for recording calls for subsequent identification. 
Assessment of data from bat detectors 
The likelihood of detecting bats acoustically depends on the propagation of sound through air, the 
characteristics of bat calls, and the way sound is received and processed by the bat detector. Recent 
unpublished collaborative research by BSG Ecology and Bristol University has shown that bat detectors 
detect calls from some species of bats at greater distances than others. In general, bats with calls that can 
be detected over greater distances are larger bats which use calls that are both high amplitude and low 
frequency such as the noctule and the most difficult to detect are those which use low amplitude calls, such 
as the brown long-eared bat and barbastelle, or high frequencies, such as horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 
spp.). Table 1 shows the mean frontal detection range of SM2 detectors for echolocation calls from UK bat 
species based on research undertaken by BSG Ecology in collaboration with Bristol University. 
Table 1: Estimated mean frontal detection ranges for selected bat species using SM2 detectors at 
standard ‘field’ settings and converting to zero-crossing recordings.

Data Analysis 
Bat Call Identification 
Recorded bat calls were analysed using Analook software to confirm the identity of the bats present. Where 
possible, the bat was identified to species level. For species of long-eared bats records were not identified to 
species level due to the overlapping call parameters of each species but were assumed to refer to brown 
long-eared bats. It is unlikely that grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus) occurs in Swansea, given the 
species’ known distribution and rarity (Harris & Yalden, 2008). Species of the genus Myotis6 were grouped 
together as many of the species have overlapping call parameters, making species identification problematic 
(BCT, 2012). 
For Pipistrelle species the following criteria, based on measurements of peak frequency, were used to 
classify calls: 
Common pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥42 and <49 kHz 
Soprano pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥51 kHz 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
 
 
 
<39 kHz  
                                                      
5 Refers to any bat species of the genus Myotis. 
6 This genus includes several regularly occurring species in the UK that include, Natterer’s bat, Daubenton’s 
bat Myotis daubentonii, Brandt’s bat Myotis brandtii, whiskered bat and Bechstein’s bat Myotis bechsteinii. 
 
 
 
Common pipistrelle / Soprano pipistrelle  
≥49 and <51 kHz 
Common pipistrelle / Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
≥39 and <42 kHz 
Bat calls which could not be ascribed to any of these categories were not used in the analysis. 
Calculation of relative activity 
The SM2 detectors were configured to record above the level of ambient noise, such as from wind or rain, 
and set to define a bat pass (B) as a call note of >2ms which is separated from another by more than one 
second. 
AnalookW (Version 3.8, 2010) software was used for all analysis of bat calls. It enables analysis of the 
relative activity of different species of bats by counting the number of bat passes (B) recorded within a unit of 
time – hour (h) was used. More than one pass of the same species was counted within a sound file if multiple 
bats were recorded calling simultaneously. During analysis of sound files, it was possible to estimate the 
minimum number of bats recorded on individual sound files but not whether consecutive sound files had 
recorded, for example, a number of individual bats passing as they commute to a feeding habitat or one bat 
calling repeatedly as it flies up and down the edge of forestry.  Although relative abundance cannot be 
estimated from this analysis, the number of bat passes does reflect the relative importance of a 
feature/habitat to bats by assigning a level of bat activity that is associated with that feature, regardless of the 
type of activity. 
Analysis by sunset-sunrise times 
As part of the analysis of nocturnal patterns of behaviour for bats the data were split into discrete time 
periods relating to their proximity to sunset or sunrise. The time categories (time codes: TC) were as follows:  
TC 0 = before sunset 
TC 1 = 0-20 min after sunset 
TC 2 = 20-40 min after sunset 
TC 3 = 40-60 min after sunset 
TC 4 = 60-80 min after sunset 
TC 5 = 80-100 min after sunset 
TC 6 = 100-120 min after sunset 
TC 7 = Middle of night (varies across seasons) 
TC 8 = 120-100 min before sunrise 
TC 9 = 100-80 min before sunrise 
TC 10 = 80-60 min before sunrise 
TC 11 = 60-40 min before sunrise 
TC 12 = 40-20 min before sunrise  
TC 13 = 20-0 min before sunrise 
For each of these categories B/h was calculated to allow a comparison between the activity level recorded in 
different time periods and TC7 was corrected to allow for variation in night length throughout the survey 
season. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3: Building Descriptions 
Internal/External inspection 
The building layouts and referencing as described in the following section is illustrated in Appendix 1: 
Figures. In order to assist with the building descriptions, each building has been given a letter/number 
combination identifier.  
B1 
This is a two storey domestic property approximately 40-50 years old. It sits east to west on the Survey Site, 
with footprint dimensions 20 m x 8 m. The roof is constructed from hanging slate tiles and has a pronounced 
pitch, with boxed-in eaves on the gable ends. There are sections of lead flashing around the chimneys and 
eaves. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following external features: 
• 
Under gaps in the eaves where boxed in sections have sagged or are broken; 
• 
Under lead flashing; 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles; and 
• 
In space under ridge tiles. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, there is no evidence that it is currently being utilised as a roost. 
N.B.     A shed in close proximity to B1 is constructed of wood cladding and has an open soffit into its roof 
space under felt. Owing to its high exposure and well-lit features, it was also deemed to have low potential 
for bat roosting potential. 
B2 
This property is a two storey domestic abode, approximately 40-50 years old but sitting 90° N of B1. This is 
an identical build to B1 but varies in specific features for roosting potential. There are opportunities for bat 
roosting in the following external features: 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles on south facing roof and water heater to the east side of 
the property; 
• 
Under lead flashing around entrance, on the roof and gable ends; 
• 
Under lifted ridge tiles where lifted; and 
• 
In gaps between boxed eaves and flashing. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, there is no evidence that is currently being utilised as a roost. 
B3 
This building is a corrugated metal framed agricultural building, its footprint dimensions are approximately 30 
mx20 m and it is situated on the south side of the Survey Site at the top of a track leading to a gallops track. 
The building is single storey with lower block curtain walling and with low profile metal sheet on the upper 
side of the walls and roof. It is currently being utilised as a stable for horses.  
Although there is lead flashing below the corrugated metal roof, upon internal inspection, an exposed interior 
with a lack of suitable roosting features means this building is considered to have negligible bat roosting 
potential. The building was however, considered to have some feeding potential. 
B4 
This is a stable block of stone, a solid wall construction, one storey tall. The roof is pitched with felt lined 
hanging tiles concluding in boxed eaves. There is considerable over hang in the boxed eaves. On internal 
inspection of the building there is a false ceiling made of plywood. 
• 
Room with partition and false ceiling, very dark; 
• 
Gaps above door frames; 
 
 
 
• 
Cracks in existing stable walls; 
• 
Space between breeze block gable ends (roof); and 
• 
Several open windows (1m in width, opening 1ft wide) and garage doors often ajar. 
B4 is a confirmed roost. There were stains and droppings (pipistrelle sp., long-eared bat sp. and lesser 
horseshoe) found upon internal investigation in one room of the stable block, and the majority of the building 
lends itself to roosting and feeding potential. 
B5 
This is a two storey terraced house approximately 50-60 years old. The roof is constructed from hanging 
slate tiles and has a pronounced pitch, with boxed-in eaves on the gable ends. There are sections of lead 
flashing around the chimneys and eaves. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following external 
features: 
• 
Under gaps in the eaves where boxed in sections have sagged or are broken; 
• 
Under lifted lead flashing; 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles; and 
• 
In space under ridge tiles. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, no signs of roosts were found. 
B6 
This building is a corrugated metal framed agricultural building with lower block curtain walling and with low 
profile metal (and some plastic) sheet on the upper side of the walls and roof. The building is currently being 
utilised as storage for farm equipment such as disused vehicles & tools and hay bales. The footprint 
dimensions are roughly 30 m x 20 m and it is one storey tall. The area behind the hay bales at the far end of 
the building which is being used as stables for several horses could not be accessed for further investigation.  
No evidence of bats roosting was found during the internal/external search and no potential roost features 
were identified. Therefore this building is considered to have negligible potential for roosting bats. 
B7 
This is a single storey brick outbuilding with a corrugated metal roof. The building has several small vents 
and cavity walls. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Accessible cavity walls through external vents. 
No evidence of bat roosting was found during the internal/external search and therefore this building is 
considered to have low potential for roosting bats. 
B8 
This building is comprised of three sections. The first two are part of the original structure which is over 100 
years old (est. 1900) and is constructed from brick walls with a corrugated, pitched metal roof with a series of 
fly ins and open access points on the roof apex. There is also a second storey tower on the north end of the 
building. The far north section is a single storey porta cabin style building approximately 4 m x 2 m with open 
windows and doors. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Gaps under the corrugated metal roof; 
• 
In the stone vents/access points at the apex of the structure; 
• 
In the series of lead flashing found around the top of the tower portion of the main brick building; 
• 
Multiple fly-in opportunities in both storeys; and 
• 
In the tower block, historic roost evidence, several small piles of disintegrated droppings, identified 
as long-eared bat Plecotus auritus droppings and at least one Pipistrelle sp. in both first and second storeys. 
B8 is a confirmed roost. There were droppings from at least two bat species found upon internal investigation 
of both storeys and the majority of the building lends itself to roosting and feeding potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
B9 
This building is a single storey breeze block shed of recent build with a footprint of 3 m x 3 m. The building 
has solid walls and a flat corrugated metal roof. No evidence or potential or actual roost points were noted 
upon internal or external investigation.  
Owing to the lack of signs and potential roosting features this building is considered to have negligible bat 
roosting potential. 
B10 
This property is a single storey, one-room brick outbuilding with footprint dimensions of 4 m x 3 m. The 
building has no doors or windows and the roof is concrete and flat with the internal ceiling exhibiting cracks 
and fissures. The brick walls are cavity walls with many missing bricks and openings. Although there is no 
door, there is an east facing entrance. Upon internal investigation two Pipistrelle sp. droppings were found 
on the floor. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Cavity walls with missing bricks; 
• 
East facing entrance, fly-in; 
• 
Cracked ceiling; and 
• 
Also, bat droppings found in building. 
This building is a confirmed roost owing to the discovery of bat droppings and a variety of optimal features for 
roosting potential.  
B11 
This is a derelict stone cottage over 100 years old. Its footprint dimensions are 15 m x 10 m. There are two 
distinct standing walls and there is no roof remaining. The walls are rubble filled and many stones are 
missing. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Missing stones leading to rubble filled internal wall. 
Because the structure sits in a cluster of trees and has some notable roosting features, this building is 
considered to have moderate roosting potential.
