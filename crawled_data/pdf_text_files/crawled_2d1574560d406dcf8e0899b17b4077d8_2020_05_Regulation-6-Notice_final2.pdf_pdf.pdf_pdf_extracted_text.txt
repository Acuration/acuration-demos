NOTICE OF APPLICATION TO MAKE A NON-MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENT 
CONSENT ORDER: 
THE PROGRESS POWER (GAS FIRED POWER STATION) ORDER 2015 (SI 2015/1570) AS CORRECTED BY 
THE PROGRESS POWER (GAS FIRED POWER STATION) (CORRECTION) ORDER 2016 (SI 2016/736) AND AS 
AMENDED BY THE PROGRESS POWER (GAS FIRED POWER STATION) (AMENDMENT) ORDER 2016 (SI 
2016/1086) 
Notice is hereby given that an application has been made by Progress Power Limited (“PPL”) of Drax Power Station, 
Drax, Selby YO8 8PH to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to make a non-material 
change to the Progress Power (Gas Fired Power Station) Order 2015 (as corrected by the Progress Power (Gas Fired 
Power Station) (Correction) Order 2016 and as amended by the Progress Power (Gas Fired Power Station) 
(Amendment) Order 2016) (“the Order”) under the Planning Act 2008 (“the Application”). 
The Order grants development consent for the construction, operation and maintenance of a generating station with a 
gross rated electrical output of up to 299 MWe comprising up to five gas turbine generators, up to five exhaust gas 
emission flue stacks and other development that is part of the generating station together with the gas and electrical 
cable connections and associated development including an electrical connection compound, made up of a substation 
and sealing end compound, an access road and a new road junction off the A140. 
The Application seeks to make a non-material change to the time limit for commencing construction by amending 
Requirement 1 of Schedule 2 to the Order due to the uncertainties and constraints posed by COVID-19. The time limit 
for commencing construction stated in Requirement 1 of the Order is 5 years from 14 August 2015. The proposed non-
material change is to extend this time limit by 1 year so that the deadline for commencing construction will be 13 August 
2021.
