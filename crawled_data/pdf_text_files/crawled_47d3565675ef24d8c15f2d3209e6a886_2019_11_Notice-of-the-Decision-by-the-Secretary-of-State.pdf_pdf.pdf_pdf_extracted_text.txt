There is no right of appeal under the Planning Act 2008. The High Court may entertain 
proceedings to question an Order granting development consent from the day on 
which the Development Consent Order is published or (if later) the day on which the 
decision letter is published. The procedure is to make an application for judicial 
review. This must be done within the statutory period of time set  out in s118 of the 
Planning Act 2008. Please contact the Administrative Court Office for further
