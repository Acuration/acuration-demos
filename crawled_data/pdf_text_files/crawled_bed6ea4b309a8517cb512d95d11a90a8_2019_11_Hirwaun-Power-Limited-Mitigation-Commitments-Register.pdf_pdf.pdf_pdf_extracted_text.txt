During construction and demolition, dust monitoring is proposed to 
be undertaken at the northern end of the Power Generation Plant 
Site, in particular, in the vicinity of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC.  A real time monitor for total suspended particulate is 
proposed, used as an ‘indicative instrument’ only.  The monitoring 
station would be mobile and should be moved around site as the 
principal activities move. Should dust arising at this location be 
found to exceed trigger levels then additional dust control measures 
from the below list would be applied. Trigger levels for the 
instrument, which would suggest increasing risk/emissions, would be 
agreed with NRW prior to the commencement of construction. 
It is proposed that solid hoarding be erected along the northern edge 
of the Power Generation Plant Site during demolition activities.   
On-site burning of waste material will be forbidden. 
The number of handling operations shall be minimised, ensuring that 
dusty material is not moved or handled unnecessarily. Fine material 
shall be delivered to site in bags. Drop heights will be kept to a 
minimum. 
Hardstanding areas for vehicles entering, parking and leaving the 
Project Site shall be provided, with wheel washing facilities at acess 
points where there is a risk of tracking mud onto local roads. Plant 
and wheel washing will be carried out in a designated area of 
hardstanding at least 10m from a watercourse or surface water 
drain. Where this, is not possible alternative mitigation will be

Main Contractor. 
The Construction Traffic 
measures will form part of the 
Construction Traffic 
Management Plan (CTMP) 
which will also be a DCO 
requirement (Schedule 2, 
Requirement 13).

implemented.  
The performance of the wheel washing system(s) will be maintained 
by the regular removal of settled sediment from within the sump. 
Run-off from this area will be collected in a dedicated sump and 
water will be recycled/re-used wherever possible. Where recovery is 
not possible, water from the sump system will be emptied to a 
dedicated storage tank prior to its removal from site for authorised 
disposal by a suitably licensed contractor. 
Site roads shall be cleaned regularly, and damped down if 
necessary to prevent nuisance dust. Site vehicle movements shall 
be kept to a minimum and, where possible, restricted to paved 
haulage routes. Vehicle speeds will be limited to 10 mph on 
unconsolidated track and 15 mph on hard surfaces. The idling of 
vehicles will be kept to a minimum. 
The main contractor will have responsibility on a day to day basis for 
determining if either the nature of the activities on site or weather 
conditions would be likely to result in the unacceptable transfer of 
dust off site. In cases where this is anticipated, remedial action will 
be taken to minimise emissions, including the application of 
appropriate control measures, or if necessary, the temporary 
suspension of works. 
Good site management practices during the construction works will 
help to prevent the generation of airborne dust. It will be the 
responsibility of the nominated main contractor and site manager to 
ensure through the final CEMP that sufficient precautionary

measures to limit dust generation are taken.  
Construction/demolition activities associated with the greatest 
potential for dust generation are: 
 Earthworks including excavation of topsoil, handling on site and 
deposition; 
 Handling and storage of materials (including loading and 
unloading); 
 Wind blow across disturbed/exposed site surfaces and materials; 
and 
 Mechanical operations such as crushing, drilling, concrete mixing 
and cutting. 
Best Practicable Methods (BPM) will be used to minimise the risk of 
adverse effects from construction dust and causing nuisance or 
damage to flora and fauna specific control measures for limiting 
nuisance dust and exhaust emissions during construction are as 
follows: 
Site Management 
 Records of dust and air quality complaints to be kept, 
including likely causes and mitigation measures to reduce 
impacts if appropriate; 
 On-site and off-site visual inspections to be undertaken and 
recorded;  
 Inspections should be increased in frequency during periods 
of high activity or prolonged dry, windy weather; and 
 Keep site perimeter, fences etc clean.

Site Planning 
 Consideration of weather conditions, dust generating potential 
of material to be excavated prior to commencement of works; 
 Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles 
etc. to sensitive receptors; 
 If work within 20m of sensitive receptors cannot be avoided, 
erect solid screens at least as high as stockpiles; and 
 Dusty materials should be removed from site as soon as 
possible. 
 
Construction Traffic / Trackout (where reasonably practicable) 
 If required due to site conditions vehicles to be washed and 
cleaned effectively prior to leaving the site; 
 Effective vehicle cleaning and specific wheel-washing 
facilities will be implemented at all site exits, including: hose 
pipes with adequate water supply and pressure and 
mechanical wheel spinners or brushes; 
 An area of paving/hardstanding will be implemented between 
the washing facilities and the site exit; 
 Hard surface haul routes to be used on-site wherever 
possible, as well as preferred routes for vehicles; 
 Loads entering and leaving the site with dust generating 
potential will use load covers; 
 Vehicles to comply with site speed limits (15mph on hard 
surfaces, 10mph on unconsolidated surfaces); 
 Water assisted sweeping of local roads to be undertaken if 
material is tracked out of site;

 Damping down of all potentially dusty activities; 
 Temporary covering of earthworks; 
 Removal of covers by area and not all at once; 
 Minimisation of drop heights; 
 Re-vegetation of exposed surfaces; 
 Stockpiles will be formed and utilised for the shortest possible 
time; 
 Stockpiles will be formed such that there are no steep sides 
or angular in form/shape; 
 Stockpiles to be located away from the site boundary and 
sensitive receptors wherever possible; 
 Stockpiles to be covered or enclosed wherever possible; 
 Exposed soils would be re-vegetated as soon as practicable.

Near sensitive ecosystems or other sensitive receptors, 
hessian/mulches or similar techniques would be considered 
where it is not possible to re-vegetate or cover with topsoil; 
 Minimise dust generating activities, particularly near sensitive 
ecosystems or other sensitive receptors during prolonged dry, 
dusty weather unless damping / other suppressants are used; 
 Ensure an adequate water supply to site and use water as 
dust suppressant where applicable; 
 Ensure any site machinery is well maintained and in full 
working order; 
 Ensure equipment available for cleaning spills of dusty 
material available at all times; and 
 Sand and aggregates should be stored away from sensitive 
receptors and screened/shielded.  Similarly concrete batching 
should take place away from receptors. 
 
Noise and 
Vibration 
Applies to all elements of the Project (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
All construction/demolition activities relating to the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be carried 
out in accordance with the recommendations of BS 5228’ Noise and 
Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites’. It details the 
legislative background to noise control, along with the recommended 
procedures for effective liaison between developers, site operators 
and local authorities. Methods of how to minimise the impact of site 
noise on workers and local residents are also provided. 
These measures will form part 
of the CEMP (see Section 3.2 
of the Outline CEMP at 
Appendix 4.1 to ES). DCO 
Schedule 2, Requirement12 
requires submission and 
approval of a CEMP which is 
substantially in accordance 
with the Outline CEMP prior to 
commencement of the 
Project.

In addition, HPL will require its Main Contractor to minimise the 
impact of construction and demolition activities through successful 
implementation of an agreed CEMP and proper communication with 
local residents. 
Unless otherwise agreed with RCTCBC the hours of construction 
working at the site, will be Monday to Friday between: 0700hrs – 
1830hrs and Saturday from 07:00-13:00 and 30 minutes 
startup/shutdown period either side. 
If works are required outside of core construction hours then method 
statements and risk assessments will be required to be submitted to 
RCTCBC for approval. Further, the contractor will be required to 
inform potentially affected residents and occupiers. The residents 
will also be provided with a point of contact for any queries or 
complaints. 
The main contractor and all sub-contractors working on-site have a 
general duty to take all reasonably practicable measures to minimise 
nuisance from noise and vibration that has the potential to impact on 
the local community or environment. To achieve this and avoid the 
potential for construction works to give risk to consequences that 
would otherwise be statutory nuisances (but for the provision of the 
DCO), Best Practicable Means (BPM) as defined in section 79(9)(a) 
of the Environmental Protection Act will be used, as follows: 
 Appropriate selection of plant, construction methods and 
programming. Only plant conforming with relevant national and 
international standards, directives or recommendations on noise 
Controls on working hours are 
specifically set out in DCO 
Schedule 2 Requirements 14 
and 15. 
Implementation of the CEMP 
will be the responsibility of the 
Main Contractor.

 Construction plant will be operated and maintained appropriately, 
having regard to the manufacturer’s written recommendations or 
using other appropriate operation and maintenance programmes 
which reduce noise and vibration emissions; 
 All vehicles will be switched off when not in use; 
 Approved routes and programming for the transport and 
construction materials, spoil and personnel to reduce the risk of 
increased noise and vibration impacts due to the construction of 
the project; 
 Vehicle and mechanical plant used for the purpose of the works

equipment; 
 Ancillary pneumatic percussive tools would be fitted with mufflers 
or silencers as recommended by the manufacturer; 
 Ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps 
would be positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance 
(e.g. ad far away as practicable from residential receptors). If 
necessary, temporary acoustic barriers or enclosures would be 
provided; 
 The positioning of construction plant and activities to minimise 
noise at sensitive locations;

Ecology 
Applies to all elements of the Project (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
An Ecological Management Plan (EcMP) will be produced as a 
requirement of the DCO. 
A pre-construction ecological constraints survey will be undertaken 
to confirm the ecological status of the site prior to demolition and 
construction works commencing.  
Briefings and instruction will be given to contractors regarding the 
biodiversity issues associated with the site and protocols and 
contingency plans will be established to deal with incidents should 
they arise including in relation to storage of potentially dangerous 
materials. 
Habitats As far as is practicable, work compounds and access tracks 
etc. will not be located in, or adjacent to, areas that maintain habitat 
value or are within areas supporting protected species. 
The production of an 
Ecological Management Plan 
is required under DCO 
Schedule 2, Requirement 10. 
This prevents specified works 
until a written ecological plan 
is approved and surveys 
done, as set out in figures 8.5, 
11.5 and section 8.7 of the 
ES. This ecological plan will 
include (insofar as applicable)

In relation to temporary effects on marshy grassland habitats, a 
detailed soil handling and reinstatement strategy will be developed 
as part of the CEMP.  This will be informed by pre-construction soil 
and vegetation surveys.  This will ensure impacts on marshy 
grassland soils within the Gas Connection route are minimised 
during site clearance, construction and restoration, maximising the 
success of the habitat restoration. 
A pre-construction survey of the site for marsh fritillary larval food-
plants (i.e. any of the scabious species) will be undertaken in the 
summer preceding construction of the Gas Connection.  Should any 
food-plants be found the survey will be extended to include a search 
for larval webs in late summer. 
In the unlikely event marsh fritillary are detected then a specific 
method statement will be developed to ensure construction-related 
impacts on individual butterflies/larvae are avoided, for example by 
translocation of larval food webs to outside the construction footprint.  
Any such Method Statement, if required would be developed in 
consultation with NRW and the RCTCBC Ecologist.   
As explained in the Air Quality section of this Schedule, monitoring 
of dust levels will be undertaken at the northern end of the site, in 
particular, in the vicinity of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC.   
It is proposed that solid hoarding be erected along the northern edge 
of the Power Generation Plant site during demolition activities.   
The monitoring station will be mobile and should be moved around 
compliance with Pollution 
Prevention Guidelines, 
installation of physical site 
boundary barriers, EPS 
Licence application, Otter 
Method Statement, Otter 
Monitoring Survey.  
Ecology mitigation measures 
will form part of the CEMP 
(see Section 3.6 of the Outline 
CEMP at Appendix 4.1 to the 
ES). DCO Schedule 2, 
Requirement 12 requires 
submission and approval of a 
CEMP which is substantially 
in accordance with the Outline 
CEMP prior to 
commencement of the 
Project.   
The ecological surveys 
carried out will be reflected in 
the production of the CEMP to 
inform what measures are 
appropriate to the 
circumstances on site.

site as the principal activities move.  This will also provide screening 
of construction personnel in relation to visual disturbance of species 
within the SINC. 
To ensure the risk of pollution incidents affecting water quality within 
the SINC is minimised a specific SINC Protection Method Statement 
will be produced. 
The lighting proposals for the Power Generation Plant Site will be 
designed so as to reduce light-spill onto the SINC. 
During works on the streams upstream of the SINCs Environment 
Agency Pollution Prevention Guidelines (PPG) would be followed, 
with inclusion of measures such as silt traps, silt fences and 
settlement tanks used to minimise downstream release of mobilised 
sediments.  The draft Method Statement for protection of the nearby 
Sites of Important Nature Conservation (SINCs) presented at 
Appendix 8.10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1.0) will be revised 
and included within the final CEMP in respect of Work nos 1, 3 and 4 
(i.e. those works which are proximate to the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate SINC and Hirwaun Common SINC) to be submitted under 
Requirement 12, once the detailed construction arrangements are 
confirmed.  This Method Statement is to be followed. Furthermore, if 
developed, Method Statements for marsh fritillary butterfly must be 
incorporated into the final EcMP and cross referred in the CEMP. 
The 1.7 ha of the Hirwaun Common SINC affected by the Gas 
Connection will be reinstated following installation of the pipeline. 
Detailed pollution prevention measures will be incorporated into the 
and the other measures 
during construction and 
demolition will be the 
responsibility of the Main 
Contractor. The mitigation 
measures will be implemented 
as per the contract of works 
with the Main Contractor and 
are likely to include the CEMP 
and the matters covered by 
the ecological plan described 
above. The mitigation will be 
implemented before and 
during construction.

During site clearance and construction fencing will be used to 
demark the extent of site clearance, to ensure that direct impacts on 
areas of habitat not requiring clearance are not subject to direct 
impacts.   
Dust mitigation measures will be instigated during construction and 
demolition to minimise dust deposition on adjacent areas of habitat, 
if works take place under conditions when such deposition is likely.   
Any broad-leaved semi-natural woodland habitat lost from outside 
the permanent easement of the Gas Connection will be reinstated 
following construction using native species.  Native species only will 
be used, sourced from stock of local provenance if possible. 
Where inside the permanent easement of the Gas Connection, it will 
not be possible to plant deep-rooted tree species, in order to avoid 
interfering with the installed Gas Connection as these mature.  
Within the permanent easement only shallow-rooting tree/shrub 
species will be used. 
The boundary of the construction and demolition footprint will be 
securely fenced, e.g. with Heras fencing, to ensure plant and 
personnel cannot stray outside the project footprint into habitats to 
the north. 
The Gas Connection will directly cross three watercourses.  At

investigated which would negate the majority of impacts upon these 
watercourses.  For the EIA accompanying the draft DCO, however, it 
has been assumed that open-cut will be required, as a worst case. 
In the event that open-cut crossings are necessary a number of 
measures will be employed to minimise impacts on the affected 
watercourses. 
Prior to construction commencing, a detailed record of the 
topography, vegetation, water depth, flow rate, and substrate of the 
affected section of each watercourse will be made.  This information 
will be used to inform the post-construction restoration, to ensure the 
channel is reinstated as closely as possible to the pre-construction 
situation.   
Works will be programmed to occur outside periods of high flow i.e. 
after will not be carried out after periods of heavy rainfall. 
Prior to each watercourse diversion commencing, in-channel 
vegetation (if present) will be removed and placed on the banks of 
the watercourse downstream of the crossing point.   
The establishment of each watercourse diversion will follow a careful 
procedure.   
In summary this will entail the construction of a dam at the upstream 
end of the diversion, followed by over-pumping of the watercourse 
downstream.

The trench will then be excavated and the pipe laid.   
The trench will then be reinstated and the watercourse reinstated, 
with the final stage being removal of the upstream dam.   
The construction footprint will be demarcated with robust fencing, to 
ensure a buffer of at least five metres between the construction 
footprint and any water bodies is preserved during construction. 
Contaminants will not to be stored near areas of hydrological 
sensitivity. 
All works in the vicinity of watercourse crossings will be undertaken 
under the guidance of a suitably qualified Ecologist;  
The hydrological assessment in the ES has identified that significant 
hydrological effects upon either Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC are 
not predicted.   
Other embedded mitigation measures will include industry-standard 
methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction / 
demolition, operation and decommissioning are minimised. These 
include:  
 
Surface water with the potential to be contaminated by 
hydrocarbons to be passed through oil/grit interceptors prior to 
discharge to sewer;

 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the 
control of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent 
the contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made 
aware of the potential impact on ground and surface water 
associated with certain aspects of the construction works to 
further reduce the likelihood of accidental impacts;

Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be 
restricted to a designated area with appropriately designed fuel 
tanks and bunds and suitable operating procedures.  
 
Siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to 
avoid pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working 
guidelines to avoid spillages near watercourses; and 
 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are 
stored will be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single tanks 
will be within bunds sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity 
and multiple tanks or drums will be within bunds sized to contain 
the greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the largest tank or 
25 per cent of the total tanks contents, in accordance with EA 
PPG 2.    
In terms of interruptions to lateral drainage / surface water drainage

 
Access roads / haul routes will be constructed to effectively 
manage drainage; 
 
Soil bunds will be placed strategically so that drainage

 
If deemed necessary, temporary drainage routes / silt fences will 
be constructed (of geo-textile);  
 
Care will be taken during construction to ensure that silt laden 
water does not enter watercourses.  This will be achieved by 
plugging existing drains, intercepting surface water above the 
working width and where appropriate by leaving filter strips of 
unstripped topsoil along main watercourses / ditches.  Topsoil 
will be replaced over post-construction drains as soon as 
possible to prevent site water from getting into drains;

the bats to roost in.  The proposed mitigation structure will be 
provided in 2016, one year prior to demolition of the existing 
structures. 
35 bat boxes will be installed on retained vegetation around the 
Power Generation Plant compound and in woodland to the north 
within HPL’s ownership. 
Habitats will be restored in accordance with the Landscape Strategy 
presented. 
The five year aftercare period (running from the date of planting) will 
help ensure new planting is successful. 
During construction, the working width will also be minimised as far 
as possible. 
In addition, rather than creating new gaps, existing gaps in linear 
features will be utilised or enlarged wherever possible. 
Works will be undertaken during daylight hours (i.e. 7:00 to 18:30)

minimised.  Where this is not possible, low sodium lighting will be 
used as this is known to have a minimal impact on bats relative to 
the majority of other types of construction lighting. 
Light spillage onto linear features will be avoided by the use of 
directional lighting (i.e. the use of hoods and / or cowls).The project 
will have regard to The Institute of Lighting Engineers/Bat 
Conservation Trust best practice guidance in relation to lighting and 
bats. 
The programme of construction will be directly influenced to reduce 
impacts on breeding birds.  All tree/scrub clearance will be 
undertaken outside the breeding bird season.  
If vegetation clearance during the nesting bird season cannot be 
avoided, an ecologist will carry out a survey for nesting birds prior to 
clearance commencing.  Any active nest encountered will be 
protected with a buffer of at least 5 m radius around the nest, with 
this being increased for more sensitive species.   
Demolition of buildings known to be used by breeding birds will 
either take place outside the breeding bird season, or will be 
preceded by blocking potential nesting locations in the winter prior to 
demolition.   
Where possible, all vegetation clearance prior to construction shall 
take place between September and February (depending on climatic 
conditions in a given year), to prevent damage to any nests of 
breeding birds.

Where vegetation cannot be removed outside of the nesting season, 
pre-clearance checks must be undertaken by an experienced 
ecologist to identify if any birds are nesting within or close to the 
vegetation due to be removed.  To ensure legal compliance if a bird 
nest is found, no works will be undertaken in that area 
(approximately 10 m in all directions for most bird species) until the 
young birds are no longer dependent on the nest site.   
Additional tree planting will also be provided immediately west of the 
A4061 at the southern end of the Gas Connection.   
The Landscape Strategy will also include reinstating any species-
poor hedgerows removed with species-rich hedgerow planting, and 
providing an increased diversity of tree/scrub species in replacement 
woodland/scrub planting mixes.  All re-instatement planting will be 
native species.  
The demolition of the two buildings within the Power Generation 
Plant compound which are used by barn swallows will be mitigated 
for by installing suitable ledges or readymade nests within the 
proposed bat mitigation structure.  
In addition bird boxes will be erected on retained vegetation within 
HPL’s ownership. 
Monitoring of breeding bird populations will take place 1 and 3 years 
post-construction.  
In order to ensure the incidental mortality of reptiles/amphibians is 
avoided, suitable terrestrial habitat for these species will be cut

The Electrical Connection Route was decided following a feasibility 
study with ecology as one of the major factors.  The final route was 
selected as this would avoid direct impact to Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate SINC.  The layout of the Power Generation Plant has also 
been modified through the design process to avoid any 
development works within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC. 
Mitigation and monitoring measures directly relevant to the scope of 
potential effects described above include: 
The design has been altered during the iterative EIA and design 
process, with the DCO application boundary being adjusted to avoid 
direct effects on wetland habitats within Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC.   
Implementation of industry standard methods and procedures to 
ensure air/water quality impacts are minimised throughout all 
phases of the project. 
Specific ecological design objectives that will be implemented to 
ensure that adverse effects of lighting associated with demolition 
and construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
 
There shall be no light intrusion beyond the boundary of the 
proposed Project Site and particularly within the SINC to the 
north of the Project Site which is a habitat that supports breeding 
birds and bats; 
 
There shall be no night-time working within the SINC while

Landscape and 
Visual Impacts 
Applies to all elements of the project (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
Several mitigation measures have been embedded into the design 
of the Project to ensure that landscape and visual impacts are 
minimised. These include: 
 Utilising technology (SCGT) that allows a significant reduction 
in stack height compared to other technology types; 
 Planting, hard landscaping and other mitigation substantially 
in accordance with ES Figure 11.5;  
 Retention and protection of trees during construction; 
 The architectural design of the buildings and structures on the 
Hirwaun Site will be designed to reduce glare and assimilate 
the Project into the surrounding landscape; and 
 External lighting will be designed to reduce trespass and 
configured to avoid glare and spillage and otherwise in 
accordance with the Outline Lighting Strategy. 
 
The landscaping proposals for planting cover a minimum period of 
five years of monitoring to ensure the landscape objectives are 
achieved successfully. The need for landscape planting is focussed 
on a few key issues, improving the amenity of the area and 
enhancing the biodiversity / providing ecological mitigation. The key 
features of the proposals as shown on ES Figure 11.5 are: 
Much of this mitigation is 
implicit in the proposals for 
which development consent is 
being sought and will 
therefore be delivered through 
compliance with the Works 
Plans (Document Ref 2.3). 
A further DCO Requirement 
requires a Landscaping Plan 
to be approved by the 
relevant planning authority 
(DCO Schedule 2, 
Requirement 5), which 
addresses tree retention and 
protection. The landscaping 
plan must be substantially in 
accordance with the 
landscaping mitigation 
proposals set out in figure 
11.5 of the environmental 
statement.

 The southern boundary of the site alongside the Main Avenue 
will be planted with an avenue of trees with the objective of 
contributing to the character of the road; 
 During the construction of the Gas Connection some trees 
and vegetation will need to be removed and as a 
consequence the route will be reinstated along its length, 
having regard to the need to avoid planting on the line of the 
Gas Connection itself; 
 On the south side of Main Avenue a line of trees will be 
extended to compensate for the loss of vegetation where the 
Gas Connection crosses the road. These trees will also help 
screen the laydown area; 
 Careful management of soils along the length of the Gas

The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to 
provide a safe working site during hours of darkness. This will inform 
the CEMP in terms of general design objectives that will be used to 
ensure that adverse effects of lighting associated with demolition 
and construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
 Use appropriately designed luminaries for the task at hand; 
 Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-
out; 
 Demolition and construction lighting shall be directed away 
from all sensitive receptors; 
 Preference shall be given to several, lower lighting units 
rather than tall, wide beam lighting units to illuminate large 
areas as it will limit light trespass, glare and sky glow from the 
plant;

Delivery 
Air Quality 
Applies to all elements of the Project (Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection) 
The performance of Power Generation Plant and its impacts on air 
quality will be measured through stack emissions testing and 
monitoring during operation to ensure compliance with operational 
limits. 
Power Generation Plant 
Mitigation of the impacts of the Power Generation Plant is implicit in 
the project design through the specification of stack height and the 
use of emissions controls to maintain emissions within set limits.  
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
No impacts on air quality from the Gas Connection or Electrical 
Connection are anticipated therefore no mitigation is prescribed. 
Air emissions limits and 
monitoring requirements will 
be stipulated in the 
Environmental Permit that is 
required to operate the plant.  
This will be the subject of an 
application to NRW separate 
from the DCO. 
The Plant Operator will be 
responsible for complying with 
the Environmental Permit. 
Noise and

A number of assumptions for noise control are implicit. These are 
stated below. 
 
Gas turbine generators will be housed in individual acoustic 
enclosures specified at 85 dB(A) Sound Pressure Level at 1m;  
Turbine filter and ventilation apertures will be fitted with high

performance silencers, and designed such that all sensitive 
receptors benefit from screening and/or directivity corrections; 
 High performance silencers will be installed in the outlet duct(s) 
between the gas turbine generators. Due to the impracticality of 
screening stack noise, discharge noise will be controlled using 
these silencers and they will be tuned to attenuate low 
frequencies from the gas turbine generator exhausts; 
 Unit transformers and generator transformers will be housed in 
an appropriate enclosure or three sided pen, to provide full 
screening to noise sensitive receptors (NSRs); 
 All plant items shall be controlled to minimise noise of an 
impulsive or tonal nature, such that the rating level as defined in 
BS 4142 is equal to the specific noise level; and 
 In cases where abnormal operation of the plant occurs, causing 
excessive noise levels the operator will inform the local authority 
and residents of the reasons for these operations and the 
anticipated emergency period.  
Noise limits will be agreed with RCTCBC. 
Inherently quiet plant items will be selected wherever practicable:   
 High performance silencers will be fitted to achieve best results, 
including on gas turbine inlets and ductwork; 
 Acoustic lagging and low noise trims will be fitted to all pipe work 
and noise steam valves; and 
expected to be between 52-54 
LAeq,5minsdB. 
Compliance with those limits 
will be the responsibility of the

There is potential for slight adverse impacts to groundwater during 
operation from the accidental release of fuels and chemicals stored 
on site.  To mitigate against these impacts chemicals will be stored 
as per current UK Best Practice guidance.   
There is the potential that the soil could impact upon the operation of 
the pipeline through chemical attack.  To mitigate against this impact 
a detailed soils assessment will be carried out as part of the pipeline 
design process to ensure the grade of pipe selected is appropriate to 
resist attack and minimise the potential for ground stability impacts

During operation the following mitigation will be implemented: 
 Landscape plan per requirement; 
 Structure/hedgerow planting on the perimeter of the site to 
reduce views of the ground level operational activities; 
 Planting with native species of trees and shrubs similar to those 
present nearby, using local provenance stock wherever possible, 
in order to enhance biodiversity and connect habitats to form an 
ecological network; 
 Amenity planting at the site entrance using a proportion of large 
size trees for immediate effect; and 
 The design of external lighting to reduce trespass, glare and 
spillage and by restricting usage to the minimum periods 
required.  
 
As well as the landscape and 
visual mitigation implicit in the
