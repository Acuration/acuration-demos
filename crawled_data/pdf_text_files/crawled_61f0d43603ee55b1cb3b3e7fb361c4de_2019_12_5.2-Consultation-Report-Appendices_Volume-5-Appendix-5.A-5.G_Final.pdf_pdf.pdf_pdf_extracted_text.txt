Question 
Responses 
How MPL has taken the response into 
account  
Is there anything you would 
like to see done differently at 
the next round of exhibitions? 
Better Advertising 
The non-statutory exhibitions were publicised as 
follows:  
 
 Letters delivered to the local community 
representatives 
 Letters were also delivered to circa 10,500 
residents addresses in the local community 
approximately within a 5km radius of the Site 
as defined in the Core Consultation Zone 
(CCZ).   
 The exhibitions were advertised in the local 
media via a press release that was issued 
on 30th May 2014.   
 A direct advert for the exhibition was also 
published in the Bedfordshire on Sunday 
and posters were also put up within close 
vicinity to the site and exhibition locations. 
MPL considered this to be a robust approach.  
A similar approach was followed for the section 
48 publicity, pursuant to section 48 of PA 2008. 
Relationship 
with 
Covanta 
and 
creep 
of 
subsequent growth 
As stated in the Planning Statement (Doc Ref. 
10.1) Covanta’s DCO came into force on 28th 
February 2013.  The DCO was formally issued 
on 25th March 2013 (Appendix 3) with a signed 
s106 agreement.  Schedule 1 Part 2 (1) of the 
1 
 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
 
Question 
Responses 
How MPL has taken the response into 
account  
DCO (‘Time limits’) sets out a requirement that, 
“The authorised development may commence 
no later than the expiration of 5 years beginning 
with the date that this Order comes into force.” 
 
Following the issue of the DCO, Covanta’s 
parent company withdrew from operations in the 
UK (Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic 
Sites 
and 
Policies 
(MWLP:SSP) 
(2014), 
Paragraph 7.18) and the development has not 
proceeded. 
 
Covanta is a separate company, unrelated to 
MPL. 
 
A model of the site 
MPL did not provide a model of the site 
however additional visual materials including 
maps, 
visualisations, 
wireframes 
and 
photomontages of the proposals at the section 
47 public exhibitions.

that accompanies the Application. 
Knowledge of the area and local issues 
MPL undertook a non-statutory and statutory 
phase of consultation to give local people the 
opportunity to review the proposals, ask the 
project team questions, and provide feedback.  
This includes any feedback on local issues and 
knowledge of the area.    
In addition, technical specialists, on behalf of 
MPL, as part of the Environmental Impact 
Assessment have undertaken baseline studies 
on the local area in respect of each technical 
area to understand the existing local context. 
MPL also engaged with the local authorities 
(Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford 
Borough Council) to enhance local knowledge 
and ensure local issues were captured in the 
EIA.    
No. Well presented, all questions answered, 
explanations given when information was not 
available.  
MPL notes this. 
Better idea of visual impact, including landscaping MPL provided additional information on visual 
impacts at the statutory s47 local community 
exhibitions through the inclusion of wireframe 
drawings as shown in Appendix 3.V.ii which 
shows the figures on display at the exhibition.

Additional exhibition (Houghton Conquest) 
Non-statutory exhibitions were held between 5th 
and 7th June at:  
 
 Lidlington Village Hall 
 Stewartby Village Hall 
 Marston Moreteyne Village Hall 
 
For the section 47 statutory consultation, as 
publicised in the section 48 notices, exhibitions 
were held at the following locations: 
 
 Marston Moretaine Village Hall 
 Stewartby Village Hall 
 Ampthill Masonic Centre 
 Lidlington Village Hall 
Ampthill Masonic Centre was added as an 
action from a non-statutory meeting with CBC 
on 19th May (Appendix 3.F).  These locations 
are considered to capture the main population 
areas within the Parish Councils that are within 
close proximity to the site. Both exhibitions at 
Stewartby and Ampthill are within close 
proximity to Houghton Conquest. MPL obtained 
input and agreement on the exhibition locations

Speakers with a Q&A session 
Members of the project team were on hand at 
both the non-statutory consultation events and 
the statutory section 47 events to assist 
members of the public with the interpretation of 
material that was made available.  The 
materials that were made available include an 
overview of the project, the Applicant, the need 
for the project, community benefits, environment 
and planning/consultation.   
Access to maps 
Maps were provided at the Non-Statutory

MPL has undertaken an extensive site selection 
prior to selecting Rookery South Pit. This 
process identified that the Rookery site had the 
following key advantages: 
 
 Close proximity to the national gas and 
electricity distribution networks; 
 Within an area identified as being potentially 
suitable for energy infrastructure; 
 the Generating Equipment Site is within 
previously developed land, lying below 
ground level; 
 it has a well-developed road network for 
access to the Project Site; 
 the Project Site is outside of areas at risk of

Electrical connection, underground cables 
MPL held an outreach meeting with PINS on 
26th November 2014 in order to discuss the 
project and specific issues including taking into 
account the comments expressed during the 
statutory consultation phase, and as a result of 
feedback received at the outreach meeting and 
during parallel discussions with National Grid, 
MPL confirmed its intention to disregard both 
overhead line options and pursue an 
underground cable option.

Reduce visual impact of stacks 
A number of technology options have been 
considered for the Power Generation Plant: 
Single Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant, 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant 
and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant.  
One consideration influencing the choice for 
using SCGT is because these plants require 
shorter stack(s) compared to CCGT, and 
therefore are less visually intrusive in views 
from the surrounding environment. 
 
A stack height sensitivity study has been 
undertaken for the Project to determine the 
minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine 
Generators, required for adequate dispersion of 
emissions and to meet legislative air quality 
targets.  The DCO Application has a height 
range for the stacks of between 30m and 35m.

The landscape and visual impacts of the Project 
have been assessed by undertaking field visits 
and producing photomontages of the plant from 
key viewpoints which have been agreed with 
statutory consultees including CBC. 
Understanding the country's need for power in the 
future the site seems ideal 
The Need for new energy infrastructure, and 
fossil fuel infrastructure, is established in NPS 
EN-1 and NPS EN-2.   
 
MPL has undertaken an extensive site selection 
process. This process identified that the 
Rookery site had a number of key advantages. 
Proposal seems to take account of local 
concerns, at present, and in general is in keeping 
with the locality and size is not a concern 
compared to Covanta. 
MPL has noted this comment. 
Stewartby does not need any more industrial units 
at all. No Covanta, no power station or anything 
else.

Once the site has been completed, a screening 
project should be implemented. An effort should 
be made to only build one plant on this site (which 
should not be Covanta!) 
The findings of an environmental impact 
assessment are contained within the ES that

assessment of landscape and visual effects.  
 
The iterative EIA process has informed the final 
design, including the landscape and visual 
assessment, along with consultee comments. 
Furthermore, an outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy (Document 6.2) and Outline 
Landscaping Plans (Document 6.2) have been

How will we utilise any unused capacity? (output) 
The Generating Equipment would operate as a 
peaking plant, with maximum operational hours 
not exceeding 1500 hours per year. It would 
operate at times of peak demand and system 
stress events when generation from renewable 
sources is reduced, and would be called upon 
by the National Grid to maintain capacity on the 
system.  
We are a rural village and don't want a huge 
power station/ incinerator close to our village. 
We've been blighted by rubbish tips and 
brickworks and perhaps it is someone else’s turn 
to have this sort of development. 
An EIA has been undertaken assessing both 
the project’s impact and the cumulative impact 
of the Project and other projects in the area – 
see section 4 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1). Watt Power are developing 3 other similar 
projects at Eye in Suffolk, at Hirwaun in South 
Wales, and at Abergelli near Swansea.  
I see the need nationally but not yet again at the 
proposed location. Marston Moretaine is being 
swamped by various projects. This was a small 
compact village but is now becoming a dormitory 
for Bedford/ MK 
The Planning Statement (Document Reference

The proposal to site building in the pit is fine. The 
impact of the stacks is the problem. 
In terms of air quality section 6 of the ES 
(Document 
Ref. 
6.1). 
The 
assessment 
presented above has shown that the Project will 
not result in any likely significant environmental 
effects in relation to air quality either as a 
standalone project or cumulatively with other 
projects. The stack height will be between 30 – 
35 m from the base of the height. The Pit within 
which the stacks are located is 15 m below the 
surrounding ground area meaning that the 
stacks are ~ 20 m above the surrounding 
ground level.   
My concern is that this development might bring 
other worse industrial developments, such as 
Covanta, or something more detrimental to the 
environment. 
MPL isn’t responsible for and can’t control other 
developments. Any new project would require 
its own planning permission which would also 
be subject to public consultation. The area 
surrounding the proposal is allocated within the 
subject to their own assessments and controls.  
It sounds a very good idea (on paper) 
MPL notes this comment.  Further details are 
provided within the Application submitted to the

Good use of land, especially if landscaped.

As a neighbour and as part of the forest of 
Marston Vale I would welcome a further

Pursuant to section 47 of the PA 2008, statutory 
consultation for the Project provided further 
opportunity for the community to review and 
discuss the Project.  Statutory 48 notices were 
published from 2 October 2014, and exhibitions 
were held at Marston Moretaine Village Hall (31 
October 2014), Stewartby Village Hall (1 
November 2014), Ampthill Masonic Centre (3  
November 2014) and Lidlington Village Hall (4 
November 2014).  
I find it difficult to believe a power station with 
200m investment will only run 65 days a year. I

Question 
Responses 
How MPL has taken the response into 
account  
 
There is growing acknowledgement within 
Government policy and industry that established 
renewable technologies cannot provide the 
security of supply that consumers require. 
DECC currently forecast a need for ~42 GW of 
new Gas and Nuclear generation between 
2012-2030. The type of gas generation required 
post 2020 must be more flexible to support 
intermittent wind. 
 
The plant will operate as a ‘peaking plant’ 
operating for a maximum 1500 hours per year. 
This number of hours will be secured in the 
DCO. 
As a peak time (clean) source of electricity I am in 
favour but await detailed proposals. 
MPL notes this comment.  Further details are 
provided within the Application submitted to the 
examination. 
Concerned about where gas will come from- I am 
very opposed to fracking and concerned about 
supplies from Russia- they may be cut off without 
notice. 
The Project would obtain gas from the National 
Gas Transmission System: this gas may be 
derived from a variety of sources. The UK has a 
diverse and wide ranging supply of gas sources 
including Norway, the north Sea, LNG ships 
from Qatar etc

which supports the application.  
 
MPL has undertaken an extensive site selection 
process, investigating around 600 sites in total 
over the past three years. This process 
identified that the Rookery site had the 
following key advantages: 
 
 Close proximity to the national gas and 
electricity distribution networks; 
 Within an area identified as being potentially 
suitable for energy infrastructure; 
 the Generating Equipment Site is within 
previously developed land, lying below 
ground level; 
 it has a well-developed road network for 
access to the Project Site; 
 the Project Site is outside of areas at risk of 
flooding; and  
 there is adequate space to develop the 
Power Generation Plant and integral 
infrastructure.

How MPL has taken the response into

It is completely the wrong location, adjacent to the 
Millennium country park. Marston Vale is being 
re-generated from its former industrial use. A 
power station goes completely against that. This 
could encourage other unsuitable development. 
The site is designated for energy use 
Currently opposed as too many unanswered 
issues. Stack height, sixe and number need to be 
minimised. No details of how or to extent of 
screening. 
A stack height sensitivity study has been 
undertaken for the Project to determine the 
minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine 
Generators, required for adequate dispersion of 
emissions and to meet legislative air quality 
targets.  The height range for the stacks would 
between 30m and 35m. 
 
The findings of an environmental impact 
assessment are contained within the ES that 
accompanies the Application. This includes an 
assessment of landscape and visual effects.  
 
The iterative EIA process has informed the final 
design, including the landscape and visual 
assessment, along with consultee comments. 
Furthermore, an outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy (Document 6.2) and Outline 
Landscaping Plans (Document 6.2) have been 
developed for the Project.

I am worried about the height of the stack 
however I feel they could be coloured to 
effectively blend in. 
MPL has sought to follow the guidance in NPS 
EN-1 and NPS EN-2 and embed good design 
within the proposals. More information can be

(Document 10.2). Furthermore, an outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

There is, as far as I can see, very little benefit to 
the community from the project. Very few jobs 
and it's next to a country park. I feel it would be a 
catalyst for other (possibly larger) projects.

Positive- low vehicle movement, smaller than 
Covanta, less emissions. Negative- Up to 60 foot 
stacks that break the skyline still not wanted. 
A number of technology options have been 
considered for the Power Generation Plant: 
Single Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant, 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant 
and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant.  A 
key consideration in the choice for using SCGT 
is because these plants require shorter stack(s) 
compared to CCGT, and therefore are less 
visually intrusive in views from the surrounding 
environment. 
 
A stack height sensitivity study has been 
undertaken for the Project to determine the 
minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine 
Generators, required for adequate dispersion of 
emissions and to meet legislative air quality 
targets.  The height range for the stacks would 
between 30m and 35m. 
 
Section 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
concludes that the resulting significance of 
cumulative landscape effects would be either 
minor significant or not significant.

Better info on running hours expected, especially 
night time. Noise emission data, based not only 
on estimates but on actual data from equivalent 
sites. 
The Generating Equipment is being promoted to 
meet peak demand and system stress events. 
Peak demand typically occurs between 0700 
and 2300 hrs. It is therefore very unlikely that 
the plant would run overnight with the exception 
of emergencies. The noise assessment is 
contained within section 7 of the ES (Doc

predicting no significant effects on residential

Dear sir or madam,
Thankyou for the opportunity to comment on the proposal to submit an
 application for the ‘Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr
 Mill Brook, Bedfordshire’.
Anglian Water has assessed the location of the site and notes that it will
 impact on existing water assets. I attach a list of assets and a map to
 identify the location of these assets. Consequently, Anglian Water wishes to
 be included as an interested party to comment on plans if the Inspectorate
 allows an application.
Anglian Water would seek to ensure the necessary protective provisions
 were in place to protect existing assets.
Please find attached ‘Statement from Anglian Water’, maps of affected
 assets and a list of assets affected which have been identified to date.

Proposed Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) Comment
Date:
16 October 2014 12:19:33
Dear Sirs,
Proposed Millbrook Power Project – Preliminary Environmental Impact
 Report (PEIR) Comment
Thank you for your recent correspondence that sought Civil Aviation Authority
 comment associated with the proposed Millbrook Power Project. I trust the
 following, which draws from information contained within the PEIR Non-Technical
 Summary (NTS) and is fundamentally in line with related comment provided for
 the Planning Inspectorate at the scoping stage, is useful.
We note from the PEIR NTS that the tallest related structures are expected to be
 between a maximum of 5x40m high stacks each associated with a gas turbine
 generator and, in addition to existing electricity transmission towers, 6 new
 transmission towers (pylons) which would each be a maximum of 45m high.  It is
 assumed that these heights are measured above ground level.  On that basis we
 belief the following (potential) issues are worthy of consideration:
Aerodromes.  In respect of any potential aerodrome related issue, we note
 the close proximity of Cranfield Airport to the development site.  Given that
 aerodrome safeguarding responsibility rests in all cases with the relevant
 aerodrome operator / licensee, not the CAA, we believe it important that
 Cranfield Airport’s related viewpoints is established and any concerns
 expressed appropriately taken into account.  You will see that we have
 copied this correspondence to the Cranfield Airport Manager.
Aviation Warning Lighting: 
In the UK, the need for aviation obstruction lighting on 'tall' structures
 depends in the first instance upon any particular structure's location in
 relationship to an aerodrome. If the structure constitutes an 'aerodrome
 obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that with review the lighting
 requirement. For civil aerodromes, they will, in general terms, follow the
 requirements of CAP 168 - Licensing of Aerodromes. This document
 can be downloaded from the Civil Aviation CAA website at
 www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP168.PDF - Chapter 4 (12.8) refers to
 obstacle lighting.
Away from aerodromes Article 219 of the UK Air Navigation Order
 applies. This Article requires that for en-route obstructions (ie away
 from aerodromes) lighting only becomes legally mandated for
 structures of a height of 150m or more. However, structures of lesser
 high might need aviation obstruction lighting if, by virtue of their
 location and nature, they are considered a significant navigational
 hazard.
Cranes, whether in situ temporarily or long term are captured by the
 points heighted above.  Note that if a crane is located on top of another
 structure, it is the overall height (structure + crane) than is relevant.
In this case, given the assumed maximum height of 45m, Article 219
 would not apply.  In the event that there is no aerodrome issue, in this
 case related to Cranfield Airport, we can advise that the CAA would not
 in isolation make any case for lighting.
Gas Venting and/or Flaring.  It is assumed that the facility is not intended
 to vent or flare gas either routinely or as an emergency procedure such as
 to cause a danger to overlying aircraft.  If that is not the case parties are
 invited to use myself as an appropriate point of contact for any further
 related discussion.
Aviation Promulgation.  There is a civil aviation requirement in the UK for all
 structures over 300ft (91.4m) high to be charted on aviation maps.  It
 follows that, at a maximum of 45m, aside of any Cranfield Airport
 requirement, there is no en-route (ie non-aerodrome specific) civil aviation
 charting requirement.  However, if crane usage in the construction phase
 involves heights of 300ft or more, the temporary structure will need to be
 appropriately notified.  For temporary structures this notification can be
 achieved through the publication of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).  If
 needed by virtue of temporary use of cranes such that the 300ft threshold
 is breached a NOTAM can be arranged through the developer providing
 related details to the CAA’s Airspace Utilisation Section
 (ausops@caa.co.uk / 0207 453 6599). 
Military Aviation.  For completeness, the Ministry of Defence position in
 regards to the proposed development and military aviation activity should
 be established.
I should also add that that due to the unique nature of associated
 operations in respect of operating altitudes and potentially unusual landing
 sites, it would also be sensible to establish the related viewpoint of local
 emergency services air support units.     
I believe that any associated Development Consent Order (or equivalent / similar)
 would be expected to acknowledge and where applicable address the issues
 highlighted above.
Whilst none of the above negates any aforementioned need to consult in line with
 Government requirements associated with the safeguarding of aerodromes and
 other technical sites (Government Circular 1/2003 refers), we hope this
 information matches your requirements.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch if
 you require any further comment or needs clarification of any point.

Dear Paul 
It was good to catch up with you after the stakeholder meeting yesterday. I never properly 
followed up our last consultee meeting with a formal comment and realised the consultation 
deadline has now passed. I am happy that we covered most of English Heritage primary concerns 
about the emerging Environmental Statement at the meeting in Brooklands in September and I 
don’t think there is much I would want to add to that discussion. A couple of things have 
subsequently occurred to me that are however worth noting, in particular, arising from yesterday’s 
Stakeholder meeting in Marston Vale. I hope therefore that you would consider accepting these 
late comments.  
English Heritage Advice - PIER report 
As we have discussed in relation to the PIER report, my primary concern at this stage is about 
ensuring there is sufficient information in the ES to adequately address the impact on heritage 
assets. In particular we discussed the need for a range of heritage specific photomontages, and 
that we would appreciate some additional views from those presented in the PIER report. 
Primarily it would be the views from Houghton House that are likely to be most important, but also 
Ampthill Park House which is Grade II* and the Scheduled Monument in Ampthill Park. I realised 
last week, whilst undertaking another consultation, that there are also potentially some views from 
Millbrook Church, in particular from the graveyard at the base of the tower. It is located right on 
the edge of the ridge overlooking Marston Vale. This is something that we may not have 
previously discussed and would be good if it could be incorporated at this stage. As discussed we 
would be looking for a number and range of locations from all the main heritage sites, and in 
particular for the heritage related photomontages to be provided in the ES. 
In relation to yesterday’s meeting one point that was raised was in relation to the SoCG. It would 
be helpful to confirm if the applicant would be looking for a SoCG with English Heritage. If that is 
the case, I think it is worth re-iterating our concerns with the assessment of harm in the PIER 
heritage statement. The PIER report technical summary (3.9.10) indicates that no significant 
effects are anticipated, and Chapter 13.9 (summary and conclusions) continues to state that 
‘effects are anticipated to be negligible and therefore not significant’ or ‘minor/moderate’.  
Whilst we recognise there will be further assessment for the full ES, our early assessment of the 
scheme indicates there would be some recognisable change to the setting of the designated 
heritage assets and in particular Houghton House. As with the previous Covanta scheme, we are 
concerned that this may be harmful to the significance of these assets. This may mean that it 
would be difficult to find common ground on this issue. We recognise however that that there is 
likely to be demonstrable public benefit from the scheme. 
The web-based system of photomontages we discussed yesterday were provided for a solar farm 
in Norfolk, and although I’m not able to share the details of the exact case, they were provided by 
a Yorkshire based company. Likewise, I’m not able to give a recommendation, but mention it 
2
because we were impressed by the usability and clarity of the delivery system, particularly in 
comparison to the paper-based montages we normally contend with.  
Mike Spence of MSENVIRONMENTAL, and his website is  www.msenvironmental.co.uk 
Finally I understand that this may not be possible but it would be very useful to have clarity about 
the status of the Covanta scheme. As discussed at the meeting yesterday the power plant is 
relatively modest in comparison to the Covanta building, however the accumulation of impact is 
potentially significant.  
Yours Sincerely 
Will Fletcher

Dear Sir/Madam 
 
PLANNING ACT 2008 (AS AMENDED) AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING 
(ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT) REGULATIONS 2009 (AS 
AMENDED) – STAUTORY CONSULTATION UNDER SECTION 42 OF THE 
PLANNING ACT BY MILLBROOK POWER LTD FOR AN ORDER GRANTING 
DEVELOPMENT CONSENT FOR THE MILLBROOK POWER PROJECT   
MILLBROOK, BEDFORDSHIRE       
 
Thank you for your letter regarding the above mentioned site, which was received on 
7 October 2014. We have reviewed the MPL PEIR and Scoping documents and wish 
to make the following comments: 
 
Flood Risk 
The requirement for a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) and Surface Water Drainage 
Plan is understood.  
 
The current proposals are to utilise the existing drainage system (associated with the 
Low Level Restoration Scheme) to discharge surface water from the new 
development. It must be clearly demonstrated that the system has sufficient capacity 
to cope with run-off from the new development for all events up to and including the 
1 in 100 year storm, both now and in the future, and that the project does not 
increase risk to the site or third parties.  
 
Groundwater Protection  
A Foundation Works Risk Assessment (FWRA) will need to be produced to 
determine the risks to the underlying aquifers from proposed possible piled 
foundations, as much of the site is understood to be underlain by a shallow depth of 
clay above the Kellaways Sand (Secondary A Aquifer). A better understanding 
should be made to the sensitivity of the Blisworth Limestone Formation (Principal 
Aquifer), which we understand to be uplifted due to faulting to the north of the site. 
This highly sensitive aquifer may be adjacent to the proposed piles. 
 
Pollution Prevention  
We require further information regarding pollution prevention, such as arrangements 
during construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposal. Information on 
waste management is also recommended.  
 
 
Water Resources  
It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the development will not affect 
any water features (ie. wells, boreholes, springs, streams or ponds) in the area, 
including licensed and unlicensed abstractions. There are no licensed abstractions 
within 3km of this proposal. 
The responsibility for the provision of a mains water supply lies with the water 
undertaker, Anglian Water Services. If the proposal will require the abstraction of 
water the applicant should be made aware that under the terms of the Water 
Resources Act 1991, an Abstraction Licence may be required from the Environment 
Agency for the abstraction of water from any inland water or underground strata. 
This is dependent on water resource availability and may not be granted.  
If you require to de-water the site then you should be aware that this activity is 
currently exempt from requiring an abstraction licence but this activity is due to 
become licensable in the future. For further information the applicant should contact 
the Environment Agency National Permitting Service. 
Permitting  
This proposal meets the thresholds of requiring an Environmental Permit. Due to the 
proposed size it will need to meet the requirements of Large Combustion Plant as 
defined by the Industrial Emissions Directive. A permit will only be issued where 
there is no significant impact to the environment. 
As has been recommended previously, we encourage you commence pre-
application discussions on your permit with us as soon as possible, so that your 
permit application can be parallel tracked with planning considerations.  
Should you wish to discuss this matter further please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Wormald 
MILLBROOK POWER STATION, ROOKERY SOUTH PIT, MILLBROOK, 
BEDFORDSHIRE 
Thank you for your letter regarding the above proposal. I apologise for missing your 
deadline of 16 November for responses, however having already provided a copy of the 
technical note which the Highways Agency’s consultants developed in response to your 
PEIR and also attending a meeting on 6 November to discuss any concerns we have, I 
trust that you have already received enough information from us so as not to hold up 
your processes. This letter now formalises our comments and they are listed below. 
Please feel free to contact me if you require further clarification.  
Trip generation: 

The trips are split into vehicles per day and then peak hour trips. This is then split
between those trips associated with the electrical connection and those
associated with the power plant and gas connection. It seems that the vehicles
per day trips are total two-way trips and peak hour trips are one way trips, but it is
unclear from the table. Further clarity is needed on this in the Transport
Assessment.

I recommend that details of the anticipated number of trips are expanded upon
within the Transport Assessment, listing both the number of arrivals and
departures for the peak hours considered. This information should be presented
for the worse case scenario reported, likely to be casting concrete foundation.

I recommend that further evidence is provided in the Transport assessment to
substantiate the figures for the Millbrook proposal, including when the peak hours
occur, the number of construction workers likely to be on site and the assumed
car occupancy.


I would like to see the impact on the affected Strategic Road Network junctions in
order to confirm whether or not capacity assessments are required. I suggest that
this is based on the worse-case scenario.
Routing of traffic: 

Following the meeting on 6 November where the potential trip routing options
were discussed, it was agreed that these are confirmed and details of all the
routes made available in the Transport Assessment. The preferred routing
options should also be clarified in the Transport Assessment. Preparation of an
acceptable Route Management Strategy may remove the need for capacity
assessments to be undertaken.
I trust these comments can be taken on board in the further work that you currently 
doing, please feel free to contact me if you need further clarification.

Dear Sir/Madam 
Marston Moreteyne Parish Council wishes to formally submit its comments regarding the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report for proposed Gas Fired Power Station project at 
Rookery South as follows: 
1. The Parish Council acknowledges the fact that the chimney height has been reduced
to 40m which will be an improvement visually.  There is a need to see evidence of
independent verification that will substantiate that emissions will be safe and that the
chimneys are at the correct height.  Concern was expressed in regard to inversion due
to the location within the Marston Vale.
2. There is a strong requirement for supervised traffic management at the site entrance in
Green Lane during the construction period.  As mentioned at a meeting held on 30th 
September 2014, between the Parish Council and representatives from Millbrook
Power and Taylor Keogh Communications; the entrance to Kimberley College is very
close to the site entrance and will pose a very real accident risk to vulnerable students
who are moving from Kimberley College to Wootton Upper School.  There has already 
been a serious accident along this stretch of road involving students and the Police 
Authority.   
3. Level of noise emanating from the engines should be within reasonable levels in all
working conditions.  This includes times when doors masking the noise are open. 
4. Seven pylons were indicated in the PEIR.  The Parish Council requests that the
minimum number that is reasonable for a development of this size are used. 
5. The Parish Council note that this development is not classified as infrastructure and as
such are interested and would welcome further discussions with Millbrook Power in 
regard to a willingness to contribute towards local community projects.   
If you require any further clarification or wish to discuss any of the points raised above, please 
do not hesitate to contact me. 
Yours faithfully, 
H. Trustam

To whom it may concern 
As the chairman of Millbrook Parish Council I am writing regarding the information provided regarding the proposed 
gas fired power station. On pages 30 and 31 of the non technical summary it states that proposals for access for the 
gas and electrical connections are being considered through Sandhill Close. I wish to point out that Sandhill Close 
has both a weight limit of 7.5 tons and a 6'6" width restriction. This is clearly visible on signage at the A507. For this 
reason I would like to propose that this access point is removed from your options list.

Dear Sir/Madam, 
Millbrook Power Limited: Proposed Gas Fired Power Plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr. 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
This is a joint response by National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET) and National Grid Gas plc 
(NGG) 
I refer to your letter dated 7th October 2014 regarding the above proposed application. Having 
reviewed the section 42 documents, I would like to make the following comments: 
National Grid Infrastructure within or in close proximity to the Proposed Order Limits 
National Grid Electricity Transmission 
National Grid Electricity Transmission has a high voltage electricity transmission overhead line 
which lies within the proposed order limits. This line forms an essential part of the electricity 
transmission network in England and Wales and include the following: 

ZA 400kV Overhead Transmission Line – Grendon to Sundon
I enclose plans showing the routes of our overhead lines and the location of our substation within 
the area shown in the consultation documents.  
The following points should be taken into consideration: 

National Grid’s Overhead Line/s is protected by a Deed of Easement/Wayleave Agreement
which provides full right of access to retain, maintain, repair and inspect our asset

Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed
buildings must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends
that no permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are

available at: 
http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/LandandDevelopment/DDC/devnearohl_final/appendixIII/ap
pIII-part2 

If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such
overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all
circumstances.

Further guidance on development near electricity transmission overhead lines is available
here: http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/1E990EE5-D068-4DD6-8C9A-
4D0B06A1BA79/31436/Developmentnearoverheadlines1.pdf

The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is
contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance.

Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and
“swing”) drawings should be obtained using the contact details above.

If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety
clearances.

Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above
National Grid Gas Transmission  
National Grid has three high pressure gas transmission pipelines located within the proposed order 
limits. The high pressure gas pipelines located within this area are: 

FM09- Huntingdon- Steppingley

FM26- Huntington- Steppingley

FM07- Old Warden- Chalgrove


National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground
levels, storage of materials etc.
Pipeline Crossings: 

Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline
at previously agreed locations.

The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.

The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation.

No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National
Grid.

National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of
the proposed protective measure.

The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written
method statement from the contractor to National Grid.

Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the
National Grid easement strip.

A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the
pipeline to comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22.

A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement
Cables Crossing: 

Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees.

A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline.

Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline.

Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is
above the pipeline.

A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement.

Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If

distance of 0.6 metres. 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 

You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.

National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and
after construction.

Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or
increased.

If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or,
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline.

Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with
NG supervision and guidance.

Further Advice 
We would request that the potential impact of the proposed scheme on National Grid’s
existing assets as set out above is considered in any subsequent reports, including in the 
Environmental Statement, and as part of any subsequent application.  
Where it is intended to acquire land, extinguish rights, or interfere with any of National Grid 
apparatus protective provisions will be required in a form acceptable to it to be included 
within the DCO.

Dear Paul 
 
Planning consultation: Section 42 consultation for proposed gas fired power plant  
Location: Rookery South Pit, nr Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Thank you for your consultation on the above dated 07 October 2014. 
 
Natural England is a non-departmental public body. Our statutory purpose is to ensure that the 
natural environment is conserved, enhanced, and managed for the benefit of present and future 
generations, thereby contributing to sustainable development.  
 
Designated Sites 
The main potential for impacts to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) would be through the 
operation of the development which may cause changes in air quality. Natural England is satisfied 
that there would not be any adverse effects to SSSIs through the construction or decommissioning 
stages. We note Table 6.10 states that air quality impacts including from nitrogen deposition and 
acid deposition are unlikely to be significant for ecological receptors. However the PEIR does not 
provide values for the process contributions at specific ecological receptors and Natural England will 
need to see the modelled process contributions for nearby SSSIs to be confident that there will be 
no adverse impacts as a result of the project. 
 
Protected Species 
We note the presence of protected species including great crested newts and bats within the project 
area. Should the development involve a requirement for any protected species licences to be issued 
by Natural England it is important that the details are agreed with us at an early stage. This is so 
that Natural England can advise PINS that the presence of protected species does not represent a 
risk to the delivery of the proposed development. Please use the following link for detailed advice on 
how to engage with Natural England on protected species licensing of NSIPs: 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140605090108/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Image
s/WML-G36_tcm6-28566.pdf 
 
We note that table 8.3, which assesses the ecological impacts of operation of the power plant does 
not include impacts of lighting. Lighting may potentially have a significant impact on receptors such 
as bat populations and should be considered as part of the EIA. 
 
Soils and Agricultural Land 
Table 10.8 identifies loss of agricultural land as an impact of the gas connection works. This may be 
through a combination of permanent loss and damage to soil through excavation and replacement 
of soils for the pipeline. To assess the significance of this impact Natural England would recommend 
Page 2 of 2 
that the area of agricultural land to be affected by the works is quantified. Depending on the area of 
land affected it may be necessary to undertake an agricultural land quality and soil resources 
survey. This would identify whether best and most versatile land is affected and inform the 
methodology for soil handling during the works. 
We would be happy to comment further should the need arise but if in the meantime you have any 
queries please do not hesitate to contact us.  
For any queries relating to the specific advice in this letter only please contact Ross Holdgate on 
03000604657. For any new consultations, or to provide further information on this consultation 
please send your correspondences to consultations@naturalengland.org.uk.

Dear Mr Wormald, 
Re: Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
Millbrook Power Station, Rookery South Pit, Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
Thank you for your consultation regarding the above development 
on 
30 September 2014.  Public Health England (PHE) welcomes the opportunity to 
comment on your proposals and preliminary environmental information report at this 
stage of the project. 
Our records indicate that we have replied to earlier consultations as listed below and 
this response should be read in conjunction with that earlier correspondence. 

Request for Scoping Opinion
17th July 2014 
PHE has assessed the submitted documentation with reference to the 
recommendations provided in our scoping response and wishes to make the 
following comments. 
1. PHE is generally satisfied with the proposed methodology.  PHE would expect
to see that the detailed quantitative and cumulative assessments proposed
are undertaken and provided.
2. PHE will provide further comments on air quality once the results of the
cumulative assessment and modelling are available.
3. PHE notes that the details of the connection to the national grid have not yet
been finalised and that there is currently no assessment of the potential
impacts of electromagnetic fields (EMF).  PHE will require the promoter to
demonstrate that risks from EMF’s have been fully considered and that an
assessment of the possible health effects is included in the final submission.
For further guidance relating to this, you are referred to our earlier scoping
response, a copy of which with updated weblinks is included below.
Your Ref: PGW/MPL 
Our Ref: ENFFGS 141003 354 
4. PHE understands that the promoter will wish to avoid unnecessary duplication
and that many issues including air quality, emissions to water, waste,
contaminated land etc. will be covered elsewhere in the ES.  PHE however
recommends that the final report should include a section which summarises
the relevant issues.  This provides a focus which ensures that public health is
given adequate consideration.  The section should summarise key
information, risk assessments, proposed mitigation measures, conclusions
and residual impacts, relating to human health.  Compliance with the
requirements of National Policy Statements and relevant guidance and
standards should also be highlighted.
We hope that the above is useful but should you have any questions or concerns 
please do not hesitate to contact us. 
Yours sincerely 
Adrienne Dunne  
Specialist Environmental Public Health Scientist

Administration 
Appendix: PHE recommendations regarding the scoping document 
 
General approach  
The EIA should give consideration to best practice guidance such as the 
Government’s Good Practice Guide for EIA1. It is important that the EIA identifies 
and assesses the potential public health impacts of the activities at, and emissions 
from, the installation. Assessment should consider the development, operational, 
and decommissioning phases. 
It is not PHE’s role to undertake these assessments on behalf of promoters as this 
would conflict with PHE’s role as an impartial and independent body. 
We note that the information provided states that there will be three associated 
development projects, but that these will be the subject of separate planning consent 
applications. We recommend that the EIA includes consideration of the impacts of 
associated development and that cumulative impacts are fully accounted for. 
Consideration of alternatives (including alternative sites, choice of process, and the 
phasing of construction) is widely regarded as good practice. Ideally, EIA should 
start at the stage of site and process selection, so that the environmental merits of 
practicable alternatives can be properly considered. Where this is undertaken, the 
main alternatives considered should be outlined in the ES2. 
The following text covers a range of issues that PHE would expect to be addressed 
by the promoter. However this list is not exhaustive and the onus is on the promoter 
to ensure that the relevant public health issues are identified and addressed. PHE’s 
advice and recommendations carry no statutory weight and constitute non-binding 
guidance. 
 
Receptors 
The ES should clearly identify the development’s location and the location and 
distance from the development of off-site human receptors that may be affected by 
emissions from, or activities at, the development. Off-site human receptors may 
include people living in residential premises; people working in commercial, and 
industrial premises and people using transport infrastructure (such as roads and 
railways), recreational areas, and publicly-accessible land. Consideration should also 
be given to environmental receptors such as the surrounding land, watercourses, 
surface and groundwater, and drinking water supplies such as wells, boreholes and 
water abstraction points.

Impacts arising from construction and decommissioning 
Any assessment of impacts arising from emissions due to construction and 
decommissioning should consider potential impacts on all receptors and describe 
monitoring and mitigation during these phases. Construction and decommissioning 
will be associated with vehicle movements and cumulative impacts should be 
accounted for. 
 
We would expect the promoter to follow best practice guidance during all phases 
from construction to decommissioning to ensure appropriate measures are in place 
to mitigate any potential impact on health from emissions (point source, fugitive and 
traffic-related). An effective Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) 
(and Decommissioning Environmental Management Plan (DEMP)) will help provide 
reassurance that activities are well managed. The promoter should ensure that there 
are robust mechanisms in place to respond to any complaints of traffic-related 
pollution, during construction, operation, and decommissioning of the facility. 
 
Emissions to air and water 
Significant impacts are unlikely to arise from installations which employ Best 
Available Techniques (BAT) and which meet regulatory requirements concerning 
emission limits and design parameters. However, PHE has a number of comments 
regarding emissions in order that the EIA provides a comprehensive assessment of 
potential impacts. 
 
When considering a baseline (of existing environmental quality) and in the 
assessment and future monitoring of impacts these: 
 should include appropriate screening assessments and detailed dispersion 
modelling where this is screened as necessary  
 should encompass all pollutants which may be emitted by the installation in 
combination with all pollutants arising from associated development and 
transport, ideally these should be considered in a single holistic assessment 
 should consider the construction, operational, and decommissioning phases 
 should consider the typical operational emissions and emissions from start-up, 
shut-down, abnormal operation and accidents when assessing potential impacts 
and include an assessment of worst-case impacts 
 should fully account for fugitive emissions 
 should include appropriate estimates of background levels 
 should identify cumulative and incremental impacts (i.e. assess cumulative 
impacts from multiple sources), including those arising from associated 
development, other existing and proposed development in the local area, and 
new vehicle movements associated with the proposed development; associated 
transport emissions should include consideration of non-road impacts (i.e. rail, 
sea, and air) 
 should include consideration of local authority, Environment Agency, Defra 
national network, and any other local site-specific sources of monitoring data 
 should compare predicted environmental concentrations to the applicable 
standard or guideline value for the affected medium (such as UK Air Quality 
Standards and Objectives and Environmental Assessment Levels) 
 If no standard or guideline value exists, the predicted exposure to humans 
should be estimated and compared to an appropriate health-based value 
(a Tolerable Daily Intake or equivalent). Further guidance is provided in 
Annex 1 
 This should consider all applicable routes of exposure e.g. include 
consideration of aspects such as the deposition of chemicals emitted to air 
and their uptake via ingestion 
 should identify and consider impacts on residential areas and sensitive receptors 
(such as schools, nursing homes and healthcare facilities) in the area(s) which 
may be affected by emissions, this should include consideration of any new 
receptors arising from future development 
 
Whilst screening of impacts using qualitative methodologies is common practice (e.g. 
for impacts arising from fugitive emissions such as dust), where it is possible to 
undertake a quantitative assessment of impacts then this should be undertaken. 
PHE’s view is that the EIA should appraise and describe the measures that will be 
used to control both point source and fugitive emissions and demonstrate that 
standards, guideline values or health-based values will not be exceeded due to 
emissions from the installation, as described above. This should include 
consideration of any emitted pollutants for which there are no set emission limits. 
When assessing the potential impact of a proposed installation on environmental 
quality, predicted environmental concentrations should be compared to the permitted 
concentrations in the affected media; this should include both standards for short 
and long-term exposure.  
Additional points specific to emissions to air 
When considering a baseline (of existing air quality) and in the assessment and 
future monitoring of impacts these: 
 should include consideration of impacts on existing areas of poor air quality e.g. 
existing or proposed local authority Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) 
 should include modelling using appropriate meteorological data (i.e. come from 
the nearest suitable meteorological station and include a range of years and 
worst case conditions) 
 should include modelling taking into account local topography 
Additional points specific to emissions to water 
When considering a baseline (of existing water quality) and in the assessment and 
future monitoring of impacts these: 
 should include assessment of potential impacts on human health and not focus 
solely on ecological impacts 
 should identify and consider all routes by which emissions may lead to population 
exposure (e.g. surface watercourses; recreational waters; sewers; geological 
routes etc.)  
 should assess the potential off-site effects of emissions to groundwater (e.g. on 
aquifers used for drinking water) and surface water (used for drinking water 
abstraction) in terms of the potential for population exposure 
 should include consideration of potential impacts on recreational users (e.g. from 
fishing, canoeing etc) alongside assessment of potential exposure via drinking 
water 
 
Land quality 
We would expect the promoter to provide details of any hazardous contamination 
present on site (including ground gas) as part of the site condition report. 
Emissions to and from the ground should be considered in terms of the previous 
history of the site and the potential of the site, once operational, to give rise to 
issues. Public health impacts associated with ground contamination and/or the 
migration of material off-site should be assessed3 and the potential impact on nearby 
receptors and control and mitigation measures should be outlined.  
Relevant areas outlined in the Government’s Good Practice Guide for EIA include: 
                                            
3 Following the approach outlined in the section above dealing with emissions to air and water i.e. comparing predicted 
environmental concentrations to the applicable standard or guideline value for the affected medium  (such as Soil Guideline 
Values) 
 effects associated with ground contamination that may already exist 
 effects associated with the potential for polluting substances that are used (during 
construction / operation) to cause new ground contamination issues on a site, for 
example introducing / changing the source of contamination  
 impacts associated with re-use of soils and waste soils, for example, re-use of 
site-sourced materials on-site or offsite, disposal of site-sourced materials offsite, 
importation of materials to the site, etc. 
Waste 
The EIA should demonstrate compliance with the waste hierarchy (e.g. with respect 
to re-use, recycling or recovery and disposal). 
For wastes arising from the installation the EIA should consider: 
 the implications and wider environmental and public health impacts of different 
waste disposal options  
 disposal route(s) and transport method(s) and how potential impacts on public 
health will be mitigated 
 
Other aspects 
Within the EIA PHE would expect to see information about how the promoter would 
respond to accidents with potential off-site emissions e.g. flooding or fires, spills, 
leaks or releases off-site. Assessment of accidents should: identify all potential 
hazards in relation to construction, operation and decommissioning; include an 
assessment of the risks posed; and identify risk management measures and 
contingency actions that will be employed in the event of an accident in order to 
mitigate off-site effects. 
The EIA should include consideration of the COMAH Regulations (Control of Major 
Accident Hazards) and the Major Accident Off-Site Emergency Plan (Management of 
Waste from Extractive Industries) (England and Wales) Regulations 2009: both in 
terms of their applicability to the installation itself, and the installation’s potential to 
impact on, or be impacted by, any nearby installations themselves subject to the 
these Regulations. 
There is evidence that, in some cases, perception of risk may have a greater impact 
on health than the hazard itself. A 2009 report4, jointly published by Liverpool John 
Moores University and the HPA, examined health risk perception and environmental 
problems using a number of case studies. As a point to consider, the report 
suggested: “Estimation of community anxiety and stress should be included as part 
of every risk or impact assessment of proposed plans that involve a potential 
                                            
4 Available from: http://www.cph.org.uk/showPublication.aspx?pubid=538  
environmental hazard. This is true even when the physical health risks may be 
negligible.” PHE supports the inclusion of this information within EIAs as good 
practice. 
Electromagnetic fields (EMF) [include for installations with associated 
substations and/or power lines] 
There is a potential health impact associated with the electric and magnetic fields 
around substations and the connecting cables or lines. The following information 
provides a framework for considering the potential health impact. 
In March 2004, the National Radiological Protection Board, NRPB (now part of PHE), 
published advice on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields. The advice 
was based on an extensive review of the science and a public consultation on its 
website, and recommended the adoption in the UK of the EMF exposure guidelines 
published by the International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP):- 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140629102627/http://www.hpa.org.uk/P
ublications/Radiation/NPRBArchive/DocumentsOfTheNRPB/Absd1502/ 
The ICNIRP guidelines are based on the avoidance of known adverse effects of 
exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) at frequencies up to 300 GHz (gigahertz), 
which includes static magnetic fields and 50 Hz electric and magnetic fields 
associated with electricity transmission.  
PHE notes the current Government policy is that the ICNIRP guidelines are 
implemented in line with the terms of the EU Council Recommendation on limiting 
exposure of the general public (1999/519/EC): 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthpr
otection/DH_4089500 
For static magnetic fields, the latest ICNIRP guidelines (2009) recommend that acute 
exposure of the general public should not exceed 400 mT (millitesla), for any part of 
the body, although the previously recommended value of 40 mT is the value used in 
the Council Recommendation.  However, because of potential indirect adverse 
effects, ICNIRP recognises that practical policies need to be implemented to prevent 
inadvertent harmful exposure of people with implanted electronic medical devices 
and implants containing ferromagnetic materials, and injuries due to flying 
ferromagnetic objects, and these considerations can lead to much lower restrictions, 
such as 0.5 mT as advised by the International Electrotechnical Commission.  
At 50 Hz, the known direct effects include those of induced currents in the body on 
the central nervous system (CNS) and indirect effects include the risk of painful 
spark discharge on contact with metal objects exposed to the field. The ICNIRP 
guidelines give reference levels for public exposure to 50 Hz electric and magnetic 
fields, and these are respectively 5 kV m−1 (kilovolts per metre) and 100 μT 
(microtesla). If people are not exposed to field strengths above these levels, direct 
effects on the CNS should be avoided and indirect effects such as the risk of painful 
spark discharge will be small. The reference levels are not in themselves limits but 
provide guidance for assessing compliance with the basic restrictions and reducing 
the risk of indirect effects. Further clarification on advice on exposure guidelines for 
50 Hz electric and magnetic fields is provided in the following note on the HPA 
website: 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/T
opics/Radiation/UnderstandingRadiation/InformationSheets/info_IcnirpExpGuidelines
/ 
The Department of Energy and Climate Change has also published voluntary code 
of practices which set out key principles for complying with the ICNIRP guidelines for 
the industry. 
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/37447/
1256-code-practice-emf-public-exp-guidelines.pdf 
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48309/
1255-code-practice-optimum-phasing-power-lines.pdf 
 
There is concern about the possible effects of long-term exposure to electromagnetic 
fields, including possible carcinogenic effects at levels much lower than those given 
in the ICNIRP guidelines. In the NRPB advice issued in 2004, it was concluded that 
the studies that suggest health effects, including those concerning childhood 
leukaemia, could not be used to derive quantitative guidance on restricting exposure. 
However, the results of these studies represented uncertainty in the underlying 
evidence base, and taken together with people’s concerns, provided a basis for 
providing an additional recommendation for Government to consider the need for 
further precautionary measures, particularly with respect to the exposure of children 
to power frequency magnetic fields.   
The Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs (SAGE) was then set up to take this 
recommendation forward, explore the implications for a precautionary approach to 
extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (ELF EMFs), and to make 
practical recommendations to Government. In the First Interim Assessment of the 
Group, consideration was given to mitigation options such as the 'corridor option' 
near power lines, and optimal phasing to reduce electric and magnetic fields. A 
Second Interim Assessment addresses electricity distribution systems up to 66 kV. 
The SAGE reports can be found at the following link: 
http://sagedialogue.org.uk/ (go to “Document Index” and Scroll to SAGE/Formal 
reports with recommendations) 
The Agency has given advice to Health Ministers on the First Interim Assessment of 
SAGE regarding precautionary approaches to ELF EMFs and specifically regarding 
power lines and property, wiring and electrical equipment in homes: 
http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140629102627/http://www.hpa.org.uk/P
ublications/Radiation/HPAResponseStatementsOnRadiationTopics/rpdadvice_sage/ 
 The evidence to date suggests that in general there are no adverse effects on the 
health of the population of the UK caused by exposure to ELF EMFs below the 
guideline levels. The scientific evidence, as reviewed by PHE, supports the view that 
precautionary measures should address solely the possible association with 
childhood leukaemia and not other more speculative health effects. The measures 
should be proportionate in that overall benefits outweigh the fiscal and social costs, 
have a convincing evidence base to show that they will be successful in reducing 
exposure, and be effective in providing reassurance to the public.  
The Government response to the First SAGE Interim Assessment is given in the 
written Ministerial Statement by Gillian Merron, then Minister of State, Department of 
Health, published on 16th October 2009:

The above information provides a framework for considering the health impact 
associated with the proposed development, including the direct and indirect effects 
of the electric and magnetic fields as indicated above.  
Liaison with other stakeholders, comments should be sought from: 
 the local authority for matters relating to noise, odour, vermin and dust nuisance 
 the local authority regarding any site investigation and subsequent construction 
(and remediation) proposals to ensure that the site could not be determined as 
‘contaminated land’ under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 
 the local authority regarding any impacts on existing or proposed Air Quality 
Management Areas 
 the Food Standards Agency for matters relating to the impact on human health of 
pollutants deposited on land used for growing food/ crops 
 the Environment Agency for matters relating to flood risk and releases with the 
potential to impact on surface and groundwaters 
 the Environment Agency for matters relating to waste characterisation and 
acceptance 
 the Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS commissioning  Boards and Local 
Planning Authority for matters relating to wider public health 
Environmental Permitting  
Amongst other permits and consents, the development will require an environmental 
permit from the Environment Agency to operate (under the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010). Therefore the installation will need to 
comply with the requirements of best available techniques (BAT). PHE is a consultee 
for bespoke environmental permit applications and will respond separately to any 
such consultation. 
Annex 1 
 
Human health risk assessment (chemical pollutants) 
The points below are cross-cutting and should be considered when undertaking a 
human health risk assessment: 
 The promoter should consider including Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) 
numbers alongside chemical names, where referenced in the ES 
 Where available, the most recent United Kingdom standards for the 
appropriate media (e.g. air, water, and/or soil) and health-based guideline 
values should be used when quantifying the risk to human health from 
chemical pollutants. Where UK standards or guideline values are not 
available, those recommended by the European Union or World Health 
Organisation can be used  
 When assessing the human health risk of a chemical emitted from a facility or 
operation, the background exposure to the chemical from other sources 
should be taken into account 
 When quantitatively assessing the health risk of genotoxic and carcinogenic 
chemical pollutants PHE does not favour the use of mathematical models to 
extrapolate from high dose levels used in animal carcinogenicity studies to 
well below the observed region of a dose-response relationship.  When only 
animal data are available, we recommend that the ‘Margin of Exposure’ 
(MOE) approach5 is used

COMMENTS 
Bedford Borough Council has been consulted upon the above proposed development as; (1) a Local 
Planning Authority within whose boundaries part of the site is located and; (2) as an authority which, 
because of the sites position straddling the Borough boundary with Central Bedfordshire is likely to 
experience many of the impacts of the proposed development as a neighbouring authority. 
The development project is described in the following terms: - 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking power 
generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  
 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
* Generating equipment including up to five Gas Turbine Generators, up to five exhaust gas flue stacks 
and balance of plant, which are located within the Generating Equipment Site; 
* A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site; 
* A temporary construction compound required during construction only; 
* A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Transmission System (NTS); and  
* A new electrical connection to export power to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System. 
 
The application is to be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment.   
  
A Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) has been lodged for comment. 
 
 
Comments on appearance and scale 
 
The LPA notes that the Environmental Impact Assessment is to contain sections which will deal with the 
landscape and visual impacts and the cultural and heritage impacts of the development.   Bedford 
Borough Council wishes the applicant to consider and provide evidence that the EIA has evaluated the 
merits/impacts of alternative stack numbers, heights and diameters on the landscape and upon heritage 
assets in the area both as a free standing development and cumulatively with the permitted Covanta 
development and other potentially significant developments in the vicinity of the site.  
 
Heritage issues 
 
The methods of assessment of impacts on heritage assets and distances for study areas as set out in 
the PEIR are considered acceptable towards undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment.  
 
It is, however, noted that the Bedford Borough Historic Environment Record has not been consulted as 
part of the PEIR and it is requested that it be consulted as part of the EIA. 
 
Traffic generation 
 
The local transport impacts of the proposals are likely to be very modest once the site is operational as 
no raw materials will enter or exit the site by road and staff numbers are not expected to exceed five per 
shift on a 24 hour, three shift rotation basis. 
  
During the 22 month construction/decommission and maintenance periods however traffic generation 
will be higher.  Bedford Borough Council will expect that access to and from the site be controlled by a 
Construction Traffic Management Plan.  Due to existing weight restrictions on surrounding local roads it 
is considered likely that most of this traffic will be on the Green Lane route directly from the A421and 
outside of peak hours.  Traffic counts and a full travel assessment should be carried out to establish 
existing levels of local traffic and identify the scale of change and that will result from the development 
both on Green Lane and other affected roads.  This will then inform what and where transport mitigation 
measures are necessary to address the impacts during the construction period. 
 
Bedford Borough Council therefore expects discussions about routing to continue with both Bedford and 
Central Bedfordshire Highways Departments and these discussions will inform the choice of proposed 
route option(s) for accessing the gas and electricity connection infrastructure during construction and 
maintenance. 
 
Gas Connection route 
 
Whilst both routes are outside of Bedford Borough boundaries the proposed gas route 5 appears to be 
shorter and likely to have less short and long term impact upon the landscape. 
 
Electrical Connection 
 
The net increase of 6 electricity transmission pylons is likely to have an adverse effect on the local 
landscape.  In terms of their prominence in the landscape the impact might be at least as significant as 
the generating plant itself.  An assessment of visual impacts should include consideration of the impacts 
of the development in its entirety and include the pylons. 
 
Bedford Borough Council also has the following questions/comments that need to be addressed: - 
 
1.            Section 2.1.7 How can the Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) be completed without the 
buttressing and re-profiling to the eastern side of the pit being completed? 
  
2.            Section 3.6 mentions the Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (2014) 
(MWLP:SSP) and that Rookery Pit is a strategic site for waste management purposes.  For information 
whilst Rookery Pit south is allocated for waste management purposes in the MWLP:SSP (2014) the pit is 
some 100ha in extent and there should be sufficient land for other compatible uses whilst still enabling 
the site to be used for the development of waste recovery uses and landfill. 
3. 
 Section 3.6 There is no mention of the MWLP2005.  This currently contains saved general and 
environmental policies against which minerals and waste development is assessed.  There is also no 
mention of the ‘Managing Waste in New Developments’ SPD.   
4.  
 Section 7 (noise) No account taken of any impact on footpath users as NSRs. 
5. 
 Section 12 (Rights of Way) 12.4.9 footpaths proposed as part of the LLRS have not been taken 
into account and are not referred to. One path will go round the attenuation pond in Rookery Pit south 
and is relatively close to the facility. Others run along the edge of the pit (see Restoration Strategy Plan: 
Public Rights of Way n. 8.8C in S106 for BC/CM/2000/8). Footpaths FP16/FP12/FP15 are located to the 
west of Rookery Pit south and the railway line. Footpaths FP14/FP65 are to the south of the pit.  I attach 
a copy of the footpaths plan that is in the S106 agreement for Rookery ROMP. 
6.            The Covanta proposals provide additional footpath links and upgrade some of the paths 
provided for in the LLRS to footpath/cycleways.  Improved connections to the footpaths in the vicinity of 
the site may be achieved if the Covanta scheme proceeds and should be explored in connection with the 
Millbrook Power Station proposal.  Please see attached footpath plan. 
7. 
 Section 12 (construction/decommissioning) 12.4.38 – construction movements. There is a need 
to take account of the potential traffic created by the construction of Covanta – which could take place at 
a similar time as the construction of the Millbrook Power Plant.  The figures for this are set out in the 
Transport Assessment for the Rookery South Resource Recovery Facility application which was 
submitted to the Infrastructure Planning Commission in August 2010 and which are available on the 
Planning Inspectorate website.  
8.            There is likely to be other development taking place within the Pit relating to waste 
management activity and also waste landfill. However, there is currently no detailed information on this 
although there was a enquiry, which was in the public arena, approximately 15 months ago. 
9.            There is a need to take into account the ongoing traffic from Stewartby landfill which is 
accessed off Green Lane between the proposed access road to the power station and the C94. Landfill 
at this site ceased two years ago but soils for restoration purposes are still being imported. 
Approximately 17,500 loads of soils are still required but importation is likely to be limited in 2015 and 
will, therefore, continue into 2016 and 2017. The operator advises that there could be an average of 75-
80 loads/day with numbers varying between 20 and 1250 loads depending on availability.   
10.
Section 12. For information the ‘old A421’ is now the ‘C94’.
I hope that the above comments and observations will assist in refining the EIA prior to the submission of 
any application.  Bedford Borough Council would encourage you to continue the dialogue with the 
council and with other groups and organisations with a view to ensuring the best possible development 
proposal and the minimisation of any environmental impacts.

Dear Mr Johnson,
Application No:
CB/14/03977/PAPP
Location:
Millbrook Power Ltd, Rookery Pit, Millbrook, Bedford, MK45 2JH
Proposal:
Consultation on Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR)
Thank you for your letter received on the 09 October 2014 regarding the above.
This consultation relates only to consideration of the information within Preliminary
Environmental Information Report, and not a comment on the suitability of the general
Millbrook Power project.
General Comments on the PEIR made by the Councils Minerals and Waste Team:
1.
Section 2.1.7 How can the Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) be completed
without the buttressing and reprofiling to the eastern side of the pit being completed?
2. Section 3.6 mentions the MWLP:SSP and that Rookery Pit is a strategic site for waste
management purposes. For information whilst Rookery Pit south is allocated for waste
management purposes the pit is some 100ha in extent and there should be sufficient
land for other compatible uses whilst still enabling the site to be used for the
development of waste recovery uses and landfill.
3. Section 3.6 There is no mention of the MWLP2005. This currently contains saved
general and environmental policies against which minerals and waste development is
assessed. There is also no mention of the ‘Managing Waste in New Developments’
SPD.
4. Section 7 (Noise) No account taken of any impact on footpath users as NSRs.
5. Section 12 (Rights of Way) 12.4.9 footpaths proposed as part of the LLRS have not
been taken into account and are not referred to. One path will go round the
attenuation pond in Rookery Pit south and is relatively close to the facility. Others run
along the edge of the pit (see Restoration Strategy Plan: Public Rights of Way n. 8.8C
in S106 for BC/CM/2000/8). Footpaths FP16/FP12/FP15 are located to the west of
Rookery Pit south and the railway line. Footpaths FP14/FP65 are to the south of the
pit.
6. The Covanta proposals provide additional footpath links and upgrade some of the
paths provided for in the LLRS to footpath/cycleways.
7. Section 12 (construction/decommissioning) 12.4.38 – construction movements. There
is a need to take account of the potential traffic created by the construction of Covanta
– which could take place at a similar time to the Millbrook Power Plant.  The figures for
this are set out in the Transport Assessment for the Rookery South Resource
Recovery Facility application which was submitted to the Infrastructure Planning
Commission in August 2010 and which are available on the Planning Inspectorate
website.   
8. There is likely to be other development taking place within the Pit relating to waste
management activity and also waste landfill.
9. Section 12. For information the ‘old A421’ is now the ‘C94’.
Air Quality
No comment to make regarding the information on this issue provided within the PEIR, full
assessment shall be undertaken when the information is provided in the EIA. Full air quality
assessment and any proposed mitigation will need to achieve standards in the relevant
guidance.
Noise and Vibration
BS4142:1997, has been referred to, has been revoked and BS4142:2014 has been
published.  The scope of this standard has now been clarified and the assertion in 7.2.21 is
no longer valid.  I would therefore expect to see an assessment undertaken in line with this
standard and look to achieve Central Bedfordshire Councils targets in this regard.
With this in mind the mitigation in section 7.3 could be subject to enhancements/additions
based on the full noise assessment.  It is suggested that the full noise assessment to
quantify any noise generation, results compared and analysed against the appropriate
methodology which will in turn inform any mitigation/design/siting proposals to ensure
adequate protection for any sensitive receptors as set out in the PEIR.
Table 7.15 suggests that there are no NSR's along the access road, from work on the
Covanta Project it came to light that there is a camp site in this vicinity used by the sailing
club which should be considered.
In 7.5.6 the operation of the gas above ground installation the report states that a 'low hum'
would be generated.  Whilst it is appreciated that there is some distance to the nearest
receptor but I would like to see this low frequency noise quantified/clarified.
Ecology
Within the Preliminary Environmental Information Report it is noted that a Phase 1 habitat
survey and Phase 2 species surveys have been undertaken to investigate potential impacts
on key ecological receptors of the proposals. Necessary mitigation will be species specific.
The Councils Ecologist is satisfied that baseline conditions will be based on the implemented
low level restoration scheme and acknowledges enhancement measures will be undertaken
in accordance with NPPF.
It is considered that the baseline information provided in the PEIR is reasonable to inform the
future surveys.
Water Quality and Resources
No comment to make regarding the information on this issue provided within the PEIR, full
assessment shall be undertaken when the information is provided in the EIA.
Ground Conditions
No comment to make regarding the information on this issue provided within the PEIR, full
assessment shall be undertaken when the information is provided in the EIA.
Landscape and Visual Impacts
These comments cover the impact on landscape character, visual intrusion, mitigation and
the need for a mitigation strategy for Rookery Pit as a whole. They highlight aspects where
further work is required, in relation to the information submitted with the PEIR.
1) Visual Impact:
1.1. Zone of Theoretical Visibility
The LVIA is not as comprehensive as required for a development of this nature. The Zone of
Visual Influence has been limited to a 5km radius - whilst this area will experience the
greatest change, the impact over 10km would highlight the communities which would be
affected by the proposal. The ZVI diagram Fig 11.1 does not differentiate between the
visibility of the vertical features and the built form of the plant and substation.
It would be preferable to have a conventional ZTVI map showing visual impact of these
different aspects over a wider area.
1.2 Photographic Viewpoints
The view points chosen are appropriate, but six further viewpoints should be assessed. The
report acknowledges that additional winter survey work is required to test visibility. This would
then inform the assessment of visual effects.
Suggested further locations -
i) From the eastern boundary of the Millennium Country Park
ii) From footpath 14
iii) From Pillinge Farm
iv) A view looking across the development with the Greensand ridge as the back ground.
v) The view from London Lane, Houghton Conquest
vi) From Houghton Conquest - including footpaths 3 or 10
1.3 Montages 
Additional photo montages are also required, particularly for short distance views from the
Country Park, Millbrook village and Ampthill Park House.
The montages currently available highlight the intrusive nature of the transmission towers.
Although there is a line of pylons already (one of which would be removed) and the railway
catenary, these structures are considered to be detracting features, particularly in the view
from the Ridge.
1.4 Cumulative Impact
The cumulative impact of the development has not been fully examined eg the PEIR has not
taken the visual impact of the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park and the proposed
turbine at Stewartby landfill site into consideration. (FMV turbine is illustrated on montages).
The information provided with the EIA should illustrate in drawing form the impact of the MP
proposal without Covanta - and without the benefits of the Covanta landscape scheme. In
the Montages - the Covanta EfW building acts as a screen in views from the north. As the
development is without significant landscape screening, the power station would be seen
from the rights of way and some residential properties in Stewartby. Whilst the latter is an
issue for BBC, the visual impact from public access routes needs to be fully considered and
mitigation designed accordingly.
1.5 Landscape mitigation:
The "Illustrative Visual" (consultation leaflet) of the MP development does not show strategic
landscape planting on the Application site. The "woodland" planting to the south is part of the
Low Level Restoration Scheme, the land for which is currently being excavated. The
proposed planting would need around 15 years growth to achieve partial screening of the
proposal. The rest of Rookery Pit appears "green" as if it was open space.
2 Landscape Character / Enjoyment of the Landscape:
The development will be a major new industrial feature within the Marston Vale, in an area
which has a recreational focus, being adjacent to the Millennium Country Park. Although the
Rookery Pit site has been zoned for landfill and waste disposal activities, it is still important
that development is designed to be sensitive to the rural location, which is highly visible in
views from heritage sites along the Greensand Ridge. Current landscape guidance produced
by Natural England places a high emphasis on the cultural qualities of the brick making
landscape.  Current views in this western edge of the Vale are of open farmland, village
landscapes, woodland and the longer distance views to the restored landfill sites of
Brogborough and Stewartby. The Marston Vale is noted as an improving landscape - it is
also a landscape of increasing importance as a recreational resource for the growing local
community, as well as visitors to the Marston Vale forest.
Considerations of the Water Courses in the vicinity of the site should be undertaken including
the route of the Bedford - Milton Keynes Waterway, this should be mapped on the water
resources plan.
3 Conclusion:
It is important to view this proposal as an individual development which would stand alone
without Covanta. Therefore additional montages are requested, in addition to further view
points, having the development assessed with cumulative impact and as a standalone
development is important.  From the information submitted it appears that the pylons are
likely to be the most intrusive aspect of the development, having assessed the information
provided within the PEIR. The EIA should explore the use of underground cabling rather then
overhead pylons, if this is not feasible then the possibility of the minimum number of pylons
should be demonstrated and what mitigation is proposed (on or off site).
Traffic and Transport
At this stage the highway authority have no comments to make with regards to the
information within the PEIR.  The highway implications will be considered as part of any
subsequent transport assessment..
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage
The bulk of the proposed development is located within Rookery Pit (HER 6681), one of the
clay pits that provided the raw material for Stewartby Brickworks during the 20th century. In
the wider project site area there are a number of known archaeological sites and features.
On the south western edge of the existing clay pit is an Iron Age and Roman settlement
(HER 19806) and to the south of that is a ring ditch known from aerial photography(HER
16566), which on morphological grounds is likely to be the remains of a Bronze Age funerary
monument. There are also other as yet uncharacterised cropmark features within this area
(HER 4469 and HER 9077), some of these may represent land boundaries of unknown date
but frequently such cropmarks have been shown to belong to later prehistoric and Roman
settlements. On the eastern boundary of the site is a scatter of medieval pottery has been
found possibly indicating occupation of that period (HER 15892). These are heritage assets
with archaeological interest as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)
and the National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1).
Archaeological survey and research in the wider Marston Vale has been limited. However,
recent investigations in advance of housing development at Stewartby to the north, a road
scheme on the northern edge of the Marston Vale and along the route of various pipelines to
the south and east have started to identify a range of previously unidentified site within the
Vale dating from the prehistoric to medieval periods. These sites are often difficult to detect
remotely and can only be identified through intrusive investigation and suggest that the Vale
contained a much more extensive settlement pattern than had previously been thought.
Therefore, the wider project area has the potential to contain so far unidentified
archaeological sites and features dating from the prehistoric period.
The proposed development site is also located within the setting of a number of Scheduled
Monuments including, amongst others, Houghton House (HER 729 and SM 1013522) and
Ampthill Castle (HER 810 and SM 10009630) in Greensand Ridge to the south, Thrupp End
medieval settlement and moated sites (HER 31 and SM 1010364) to the west, The Rectory
Moated site HER 3236 and SM 1009588), Houghton Conquest to the east and Ampthill Park
(HER 1369 and RPG 10000378). Under the terms of the NPPF and National Policy
Statement for Energy these are designated heritage assets of the highest importance.
Development within the setting of these designated heritage assets will have an impact on
their significance.
The Preliminary Environmental Information Report deals with archaeology and cultural
heritage issues in Chapter 13 (baseline information, significance, impacts and mitigation) and
Technical Appendices – Volume 1, 12.3 (policy matters). The summary of the policy context
is adequate.
The Archaeology Team’s comments on an earlier consultation (CB/14/02453/OAC) are
acknowledged in Table 13.4 and generally seem to have been accepted within the Report.
The baseline information on archaeology and the cultural heritage will be collected through a
desk-based assessment within a study area with a 5km radius for setting issues in relation to
designated heritage assets and a 1 km radius for direct physical impacts on undesignated
heritage assets. This is a reasonable approach identifying the baseline information on
archaeology for the Environmental Statement. In 13.4.1 of the Report it is stated that there
are no features of archaeological interest recorded in the Historic Environment Record for
plant site. This is not the case as Rookery Pit itself is recorded in the HER (HER 6681) and is
important as part of the remains of the brick making industry in the Marston Vale.
Further, detailed assessment of designated and undesignated heritage assets is proposed
for the impact of the power generation plant, including the impact on the setting of the
identified designated heritage assets, for the Environmental Statement. This will certainly be
required. Photomontages taken from locations 3, 4, 5 and 9 as shown on Figure 11.2 will be
required to illustrate the impact on Scheduled Monuments and Registered Parks showing the
existing baseline situation, the view after development and with mitigation. The assessment
of the impact of the proposal on the setting of designated heritage assets must conform to
English Heritage’s The Setting of Heritage Assets (2011), in particular 4.2 and the first four
steps in the assessment process it describes.
Construction of the gas and electrical connections has the potential to affect as yet
unrecorded archaeological. This potential impact was identified in the Archaeology Team’s
earlier comments remains as was the requirement for archaeological field evaluation to
provide information on the location, extent and character of any archaeological remains that
will be affected. The Report acknowledges this (Tables 13.12 and 13.13) and says that the
scope of the evaluation will be agreed with this Authority. This is satisfactory, but it is
important to note that the information from the evaluation is required to inform the
Environmental Statement and does not form part of the mitigation process as suggested by
the Report (Tables 13.12 and 13.13).
Section 13.3 of the Report briefly discusses mitigation measures. It suggests that “standard
mitigation measures include directing development away from known areas of buried
archaeology and adherence to a CEMP to set out a process for notifying a local authority
archaeologist of any archaeological remains are identified during the development. The
avoidance of known archaeological remains is an important method for ensuring there are no
damaging impacts on heritage assets with archaeological interest. This does rely on there
being adequate information on the on archaeological remains before the development starts,
hence the importance the pre-determination archaeological field evaluation of the gas and
electrical connection corridors. However, the proposals for mitigation based on a reporting
process embedded in the CEMP are wholly inadequate. There is no indication of how
archaeological features will be identified in the development process nor of how the impact
would be dealt with, presumably some form of investigation, once any remains had been
reported. It is also not an appropriate way of dealing with the impact of the proposal on the
brick pit (Table 13.10). This section also contradicts mitigation proposals identified in Tables
13.12 and 13.13 for archaeological investigation and recording which is an appropriate
strategy. I suggest that the mitigation proposals contained in the first bullet point of 13.3.1,
the use of CEMP procedures as the basis for archaeological mitigation, is deleted and
replacement with a statement about agreeing an appropriate programme of investigation and
recording agreed with this Authority.
Socio-economics
No comment to make regarding the information on this issue provided within the PEIR, full
assessment shall be undertaken when the information is provided in the EIA.
Conclusions
The information submitted with the PEIR has provided the Local Authority with initial
information. It is considered that the issues raised above should inform the additional
information to be provided with the Environmental Impact Assessment, so full assessment of
any impacts of the project can be undertaken.
Please note that the comments given above constitute an informal officer opinion and are
intended for your guidance only. The content of this letter therefore does not bind the formal
consideration of any Development Consent Order consultation by the Local Planning
Authority.
Yours faithfully,
Annabel Robinson

Response to the consultation - Millbrook Power
Dear Sir/Madam, 
I’d like to formally express concern regarding the construction of the transmissions towers on the Millbrook Power 
Project, especially with respect to the construction work that is planned to interfere with the Millbrook Proving 
Ground operation on the North side of our site. Figure 1.2 from your preliminary Environmental Information Report, 
shows a redline boundary that cuts across our engineering centre, this area of our Proving Ground is used 
extensively for the development of vehicles for the transportation and automotive sector, some of these vehicles 
are sensitive and confidential and must be kept in a secure environment.  
There does not seem to have been due consideration for this element during your project planning phase which may 
result in significant economic detriment to our business which has not been included in your socio-economic 
investigation, this will need to be addressed. 
We would welcome further discussion on this element so an agreeable position is found to mitigate the issues for 
our business. 
With kindest regards

Dear Mr Scanlon, 
 
Millbrook Power Limited: Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery 
South Pit, Nr. Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the above project. Anglian 
Water is the sewerage and water undertaker for the proposed site. The 
following comments are submitted on behalf of Anglian Water. 
 
The Project as a whole including changes since the 2014 consultation 
 
Anglian Water previously provided comments on the above project as part 
of the 2014 consultation (Anglian Water reference LDF/SP15 (O29). The 
following comments are made in the context of those previously made. 
 
We would welcome further discussions with Millbrook Power Ltd prior to the 
submission of the Draft DCO to the Planning Inspectorate for examination. 
In particular it would be helpful if we could discuss the following issues: 
 
 
Wording of the Draft DCO including protective provisions for the 
benefit of Anglian Water. 
 
Requirement for water and/or wastewater services (if required). 
 
Impact of development on Anglian Water’s assets and the need for 
mitigation. 
 
Pre-construction surveys and ground investigations. 
 
It is considered that protective provisions specifically for the benefit of 
Anglian Water should be included as part of the wording of the Draft DCO.

These protective provisions are in addition to that for utility companies as 
set out in the model provisions for DCO applications. Appendix 1 of this 
letter outlines the recommended wording for inclusion in the Draft DCO. 
 
In our previous response in 2014 we had previously highlighted that there 
were a number of existing water assets within the boundary of the site.  
 
As noted in the consultation documentation the precise layout of the project 
has yet to be established. If it is not possible to incorporate existing water 
mains as part of the site layout there may be a need to divert these 
asset(s). We have a duty to divert existing mains where requested to do so 
although it would be at the applicant’s expense. 
 
If a diversion(s) is required you would need to make a formal application to 
Anglian Water for this purpose. Further details of the application process are 
available to view at the following address: 
 
http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/developers/diversion-of-a-water-main.aspx 
 
Updated Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) 
 
It is noted that water is not generally required for the project as outlined in 
Chapter 9 (Water Quality and Resources) of the PEIR.  In the event that a 
connection to the existing water supply network is required we would 
welcome further discussion on this issue. 
 
It is noted that the focus of the Flood Risk Assessment (Volume G of the 
PEIR) is on the risk of flooding from both fluvial and surface water sources.  
It would be helpful to clarify whether there are any foul flows which will 
discharge into the public sewerage network in Anglian Water’s ownership.

Dear Sir/ Madam 
 
Re: Millbrook Power Limited: proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit near 
Millbrook on the Central Bedfordshire and Bedford boundary 
 
 
Thank you for your letter notifying Buckinghamshire County Council (BCC) of the consultation on the 
proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit near Millbrook on the Central Bedfordshire and 
Bedford boundary.  BCC is grateful for the opportunity to contribute to shaping the proposals for the 
power plant. 
 
BCC acknowledges the importance of consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008.  
Within Buckinghamshire, BCC has a statutory role for strategic planning as the County Highways 
Authority, County Transport Authority, County Flood Authority, County Education Authority and 
County Minerals and Waste Planning Authority.  It also has an obligation for joint working with 
District Councils within Buckinghamshire on their Local Plans.  The County Council also fulfils other 
functions which advise on planning proposals such as the County Archaeology service which 
maintains the local Historic Environment Record, the County Ecology Service which has 
responsibility for monitoring and protecting the natural environment including the maintenance of the 
Bucks and Milton Keynes Environmental Records Centre and ecological resource of the County and 
the Public Rights of Way service which has responsibility for the managing and maintaining the 
County’s Definitive Map. 
 
BCC as a statutory Authority has an influencing role over County wide strategic planning matters 
with each of the Districts within the County as part of the duty to co-operate (Localism Act 2011) and 
a public health obligation to safeguard social, economic and environmental wellbeing of the County. 
 
BCC acknowledges the positive contribution the project can make to the energy needs of 
communities.  Furthermore, in consideration of the content of the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) it is concluded that an increase in traffic flow within Buckinghamshire as a 
result of the proposals would not be considered a severe residual impact of the Millbrook Power 
development and could be attributed to natural fluctuation. 
 
Please do not hesitate to consult BCC on any other aspects of the proposed project.  If you have 
any queries, please contact me via the details below. 
 
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Scanlon,
Application No:
CB/17/02610/PAPP
Location:
Millbrook Power, Rookery Pit, Millbrook, Bedford, MK45 2JH
Proposal:
Consultation on Preliminary Environmental Information Report PEIR.
Thank you for your letter received on the 23 May 2017 regarding the above.
The Local Authority has undertaken some internal consultations to ensure that the content of
the PEIR has sufficient information to consider at a later date. Please see comments below:
Minerals and Waste
The applicant appears to be taking into account the adjacent Resource Recovery Facility
DCO. Therefore I have no comments at this stage.
Ecology
As with the 2014 PIER I have no concerns regarding the information submitted. I note that a
Phase 1 habitat survey and Phase 2 species surveys have been undertaken to investigate
potential impacts on key ecological receptors of the proposals. Necessary mitigation will be
species specific.
I am satisfied that baseline conditions will be based on the implemented LLRS and I
acknowledge enhancement measures will be undertaken in accordance with NPPF.
Archaeology
The Preliminary Environmental Information Report deals with archaeology and cultural
heritage issues in Chapter 13 (baseline information, significance, impacts and mitigation) and
Technical Appendices – Volume K.
The Archaeology Teams comments on an earlier consultation (CB/14/03977/PAPP) and
subsequent informal discussions about mitigation options are acknowledged in Chapter 13 of
the PEIR. The baseline information on archaeology and the cultural heritage will be collected
through a desk-based assessment within a study area with a 5km radius for setting issues in
relation to designated heritage assets and a 1 km radius for direct physical impacts on
undesignated heritage assets. This is a reasonable approach identifying the baseline
information on archaeology for the Environmental Statement.
The Archaeological Desk-Based Assessment submitted at Technical Appendix Volume K is
dated August 2014 and is, therefore, now three years old. However, it is stated in the PEIR
(13.5.8) that the Assessment will be updated for the Environmental Statement that will
accompany the DCO application for this development. The Assessment will also need to be
expanded to cover the impact of the proposed development on the designate heritage assets
following the methods and principles described in Historic England (2015) The Setting of
Heritage Assets Historic Environment Advice in Planning: 3. At present the setting of the
designated heritage assets, and in particular the Scheduled Monuments, is dealt with in
Chapter 11 and Appendix Volume I of the PEIR. The setting of a designated heritage asset is
not purely a matter of visual impact as had been made clear in a recent High Court decision
(Steer v SSCLG, 22 June 2017) and it should, therefore, be dealt with in the Historic
Environment chapter of the Environmental Statement.
The construction of the gas and electricity connectors has been identified as having the
potential to buried archaeological remains (non designated heritage assets). This is a correct
assessment of the potential impact of the scheme. In their 2014 advice the Archaeology
Team indicated that an archaeological field evaluation of the route of the connectors should
be undertaken to provide baseline information on archaeology for the these parts of the
proposed development. Following further discussions with the applicant’s archaeological
consultant an alternative approach has been identified in this instance involving mitigating
the impact of the connectors on archaeology through a programme of archaeological
investigation secured as a Requirement of the Development Control Order. This does reflect
the substance of the discussions between the Archaeology Team and the applicant’s
archaeological consultant.
Subject to the comments above the proposals for the inclusion of archaeology in the
Environmental Statement to accompany the DCO application described in the submitted
documents appear adequate.
Landscape Visual Assessment
I have few comments to make at this stage, having been consulted on the earlier submission
in 2014. This development will add a significant structure to the Rookery Site, but will be
seen as secondary in scale to the Covanta RRF. I am satisfied that the LVIA studies will and
have been undertaken to the LI Guidelines. Key views will be affected eg from Ampthill Park
and the Greensand Escarpment and also from many rights of way across the vale.
It is noted that the intention is to maintain a dark site, which is to be welcomed ,as this will
reduce the night time impact. The proposals to underground pylons is also welcomed.
A full landscaping scheme will be required. It would also be beneficial to have a commitment
to some off site planting eg to help mitigate views from public right of way and the residential
properties identified as having an adverse change in the view. This is not expected to be an
extensive contribution,but as the site is within the Forest of Marston Vale , the site needs to
support the aims of The Forest Plan and meet the 30% tree canopy expectation.
It would be helpful to be involved in the development of the colour palette and Landscape
and Ecology Management Plan in due course.
Highways
The provision of a gas turbine for electricity generation would have highway aspects relating
to access from Green Lane which is said to be shared with the adjacent energy from waste
site (EfW) and construction traffic.
If the EfW development does not go ahead or this development started first then a new
access will need to be submitted as part of any DCO (Development Consent Order)
application, though it should be pointed out that a ghost right turn access has already been
approved through the EfW development which itself was subject to being granted through
the DCO process. Details on construction vehicles including abnormal loads and full details
of a construction traffic route would be required. I would not wish to see any routing from the
A507 through Lidlington, Millbrook or Marston Moretaine.
I have a concern over the access shown on drg 31116/2001/007 as works traffic is shown
entering/exiting on both sides of Houghton Lane and regular access to the AGI site off an
existing track access, whilst I agree in the short term some mitigation can be provided I have
a concern over the longer term if those access point were to remain and become permanent.
Drg 31116/20012006 shows the traffic management on Green Lane but I would question
why the access itself would not be constructed prior to any commencement on site. We
would of course need to see engineering layout for approval.
Notwithstanding this the wait here sign closest to the railway barriers for the proposed signals
means that there could be concerns over traffic backing up and possibly onto the railway line.
This is a matter for Network Rail to agree to and no doubt they will have been consulted on
this matter as well.
As the development would be subject to a DCO details on the provision on cabling within the
public highway would be identified and provided within that application. The turbine will run
on gas and as such details on the nearest gas line should also be included within the DCO
application.
General Conclusion
In addition to the above the Council's Pollution Team, Public Health Team, SuDs
Management Team, Flood Risk Team and Renewable's Team were consulted, however did
not raise any comments on the content of the PEIR. Please note it may appropriate to liaise
directly with Central Bedfordshire Council's Public Protection (Pollution) Team directly to
ensure the noise issues we have discussed on the phone are considered appropriately.
With regard to the above, please include any additional comments in the final submission of
the Environmental Impact Report, when the Council will be able to make a formal
consultation response once the final document has been received.
Please note that the comments given above constitute an informal officer opinion and are
intended for your guidance only. The content of this letter therefore does not bind the formal
consideration of any planning process by the Local Planning Authority.
Yours sincerely,
John Ellis
Planning Manager West
 
 
Millbrook Power Limited – Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit near Millbrook Beds.  
Statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 – Phase 2 Statutory Consultation (29th May 
– 2nd July 2017).  CCB Comments 30th May 2017 to info@millbrookpower.co.uk 
Thank you for consulting the Chilterns Conservation Board in connection with the above Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP).   The Chilterns Conservation Board was established as an independent body by 
Parliamentary Order in July 2004 and has 27 members, all drawn from local communities. The Board’s purposes 
are stated in section 87 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW Act), as:  
s 87 (1) It is the duty of a conservation board, in the exercise of their functions, to have regard to: (a) the purpose of 
conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area of outstanding natural beauty, and (b) the purpose of increasing 
the understanding and enjoyment by the public of the special qualities of the area of outstanding natural beauty, but if it 
appears to the Board that there is a conflict between those purposes, they are to attach greater weight to the purposes 
mentioned in paragraph (a).  
s87 (2) A conservation board, while having regard to the purposes mentioned in subsection (1) shall seek to foster the 
economic and social well-being of local communities within the area of outstanding natural beauty, but without incurring 
significant expenditure in doing so, and shall for that purpose co-operate with local authorities and public bodies whose 
functions include the promotion of economic or social development within the area of outstanding natural beauty’.  
The Board has published an AONB Management Plan 2014-2019 A Framework for Action and a series of position 
statements, which include guidance on development within the setting of the AONB (Development Affecting the 
Setting of the Chilterns AONB) available at 
http://www.chilternsaonb.org/uploads/files/ConservationBoard/PlanningDevelopment.  The Management Plan, which is 
confirmed as a material planning consideration in planning practice guidance, deals with setting at AONB 
Management Plan policy D6 that ‘full account should be taken of the likely impacts of developments on the setting of 
the AONB’ (full document available at http://www.chilternsaonb.org/conservation-board/management-plan.html) 
The nearest part of the AONB to the immediate south - south east of the Millbrook proposal is at Sharpenhoe 
Clappers, comprising 55 hectares of National Trust countryside including open access land on the escarpment 
and enjoying fine views to the north and north-west.  From a site visit it is apparent that the AONB benefits 
from the wider landscape here and the views are important.   The distance to the proposed NSIP development is 
some 12/13km.  The Board would seek further detail on: 
(1) The implications for this project on the skyline view and reassurances that the skyline would not be ‘broken’ 
by the proposed 35 metres stack tower structure associated with this proposal.  The cumulative impact of this 
would also require commentary within the scope of the Infrastructure Planning (EIA) Regulations 2009; and 
(2) Any proposed materials or landscaping which will serve to mitigate any visual impact in the wider view, or 
reassurances that these matters can be taken into account when considering the impacts on the AONB.  We 
accept that these matters may be relevant for the development consent order and would ask that they are 
considered in the next stage of the preliminary environmental information report non-technical summary where 
it deals with landscape and visual assessment.   
CCB proposes amendment to the content of paragraph 3.7.8 and 3.7. 9 of the non-technical summary to include 
Sharpenhoe Clappers as a local viewpoint from an elevated part of the Chilterns AONB, reassurances are 
required to avoid any stack structure being visible on the skyline as well as some confirmation that materials and 
design are relevant to the mitigation of impacts.   CCB is grateful that these matters can be the subject of 
inclusion in future landscape and visual impact assessment and that reassurance can be given as to the visual 
impact from these elevated viewpoints.  Michael Stubbs, Planning Adviser Chilterns Conservation Board, The

You should note that the interests of the CLH Pipeline System are conserved by means of the  
Energy Act 2013, in particular Part IV of the Act, and other legislation such as the Pipeline Safety 
Regulations 1996. It is, however, the Energy Act 2013 that prohibits any development and most 
intrusive activities within the Easement Strip without specific consent from CLH Pipeline System. 
CLH Pipeline System Easement Strips are 6 metres wide and can incorporate other associated 
CLH Pipeline System facilities. 
 
Central Services will be able to provide guidance on the required procedures for entering into 
a Works Consent and provide confirmation on permitted development and intrusive activities. 
The whole process of obtaining Works Consent can take between four and six weeks 
depending on circumstances at the time of application. 
 
To reiterate, you should not undertake any work or activity without first contacting the CLH 
Pipeline System Operator for advice and, if required, Works Consent.  For your additional

cumulative effects 
cumulative effects 
Summation of effects that result from 
changes caused by a development in 
conjunction with other reasonably 
foreseeable development that is either 
consented but not yet constructed or is 
in the process of seeking consent.   
dB(A) 
A-weighting sound 
level 
The sound pressure level determined 
when using the frequency-weighting 
network A.  The A-weighting network 
modifies the electrical response of a 
sound level meter so that the 
sensitivity of the meter varies with 
frequency in approximately the same 
way that the sensitivity of the human 
hearing system varies with frequency.   
The human ear has a non-linear 
frequency response; it is less sensitive 
at low and high frequencies and most 
sensitive in the range of 1 to 4 kHz.  
The A-weighting is applied to 
measured or calculated sound 
pressure levels so that these levels 
correspond more closely to the 
response of the human ear.  A-
weighted sound levels are often 
denoted as dB(A).   
DCO

Introduction 
1.1 
Introduction 
1.1.1 Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") is proposing to develop a gas-fired power 
generation plant (and connections to the electricity and gas networks) on land 
located in Rookery South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook and 
Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire. 
1.1.2 In 2014, MPL consulted on its proposals (as they stood at that time). In March 
2015 MPL put "on hold" its plans and notified the public that this was the case. 
Under the new ownership of the UK energy company Drax Group plc, MPL is 
now resuming the development consent process for the Project. 
1.1.3 The Project would comprise: 
� 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
- 
Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with an 
exhaust gas flue stack and balance of plant, which are located within 
the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment"); 
- 
A new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the "Access Road" or the “Short Access Road”);  
- 
A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
� 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"); 
and 
� 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the "Electrical Connection").  
1.1.4 The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire. The boundary of the Project Site 
falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC).  
1.1.5 A full description of the Project and Project Site can be found in Chapter 3 of 
the Millbrook Power Project Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(“PEIR”), which this document accompanies. The location of the Project Site is 
shown in Figure 1.1 of the PEIR.

1.1.6 More information on the Project can also be found at 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk. 
1.1.7 The Project is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
("NSIP") under the Planning Act 2008, which means that development consent 
is required by means of a Development Consent Order ("DCO"). The DCO 
application for the Project will be submitted to the Secretary of State via the 
Planning Inspectorate ("PINS") and, once accepted, it will be considered over 
a six-month examination period by an Examining Authority (made up of 
Planning Inspectors from PINS) on behalf of the Secretary of State for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the "Secretary of State"). The final 
decision on the application would be made by the Secretary of State following 
a recommendation made by the Examining Authority. Consultation with local 
people, businesses and organisations is an essential part of the DCO process 
and will help to influence the final design of the Project. 
1.1.8 MPL anticipates submitting an application for development consent for the 
Project in Q4 2017. The application would then be examined by an Examining 
Authority appointed by the Secretary of State over the course of 2018, with a 
decision from the Secretary of State likely to be issued in mid-2019. 
1.2 
Purpose of the Project Overview Document 
1.2.1 The Project Overview Document forms part of a suite of documents provided 
for statutory consultation on the proposal under Section 42 of the Planning Act 
2008; a summary of consultation undertaken to date is provided in Section 2. 
The documents which this accompanies, and which have also been published 
as part of this consultation are: 
� 
PEIR; and 
� 
The PEIR Non-Technical Summary (“PEIR NTS”). 
1.2.2 The purpose of the Project Overview Document is to provide an explanation of 
the interaction between the Project and the Rookery South Resource 
Recovery Facility (the "Rookery South RRF Project"), which is another project, 
promoted by a separate developer, Covanta Rookery South Limited 
(“Covanta"). 
1.2.3 The document is structured as follows:   
a. a summary of the consultation undertaken to date, and details of the 
second phase of statutory consultation on the Project, of which this 
document forms a part (Section 2 of this document); 
b. an explanation of the interaction between the Project and the Rookery 
South RRF Project (Section 3 of this document); and

c. 
details of the next steps in the Project programme including details of how 
MPL will continue to address the interrelationship with the Rookery South 
RRF Project (Section 4 of this document).     
Planning and Public Consultation   
1.2.4 MPL undertook an initial phase of statutory consultation in October/November 
2014 which was preceded by a period of informal consultation that 
commenced in June 2014. Details of this public consultation are provided in 
Section 2. Section 3.3 provides further details of consultation undertaken with 
Covanta during this initial phase of public consultation in order to manage the 
relationship between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project.    
1.2.5 Due to the length of time since MPL last consulted on the Project MPL will 
undertake further statutory consultation on the Project in accordance with the 
Planning Act 2008 in order to inform key stakeholders and the public of the 
key changes to the Project that have been made following consideration of the 
consultation responses from 2014.  
1.2.6 The second phase of statutory public consultation will begin on 29th May 2017 
and will end on 2nd July 2017. This gives a further opportunity to comment on 
the Project. Further details of the second phase of statutory public consultation 
are provided in a Statement of Community Consultation (“SoCC”) published by 
MPL which is available to view at www.millbrookpower.co.uk.  
Preliminary Environmental Information Report  
1.2.7 A PEIR has been published alongside this document, which provides 
preliminary environmental information relating to the Project.  
1.2.8 The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the "EIA Regulations") require an Environmental Impact Assessment 
("EIA") to be carried out in respect of any development listed in Schedule 1 to 
the EIA Regulations ("Schedule 1 development").  
1.2.9 The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal power station with 
a heat output of 300 MW or more (as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(a) of 
the EIA Regulations). Therefore, an EIA for the Project is required under the 
EIA Regulations.  
1.2.10 The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(the "EIA Regulations 2017") regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 2009 before 
the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in 
accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37(2)(a)(ii) of the 
EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the 
Project.

1.2.11 Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations, the applicant is required to set 
out how it intends to publicise and consult on preliminary environmental 
information relating to the Project. Preliminary environmental information is 
defined by Regulation 2 of the EIA Regulations as the environmental 
information that has been compiled by the applicant and which is reasonably 
required to assess the environmental effects of the development.  
1.2.12 In the case of the Project, information has been compiled into the PEIR which 
presents the environmental information collected to date and an assessment, 
on a preliminary basis, of the likely significant environmental effects of the 
Project.  This is the second "PEIR" which has been prepared for the Project; 
the first was published and consulted upon in 2014 (the "2014 PEIR") together 
with supporting information and a Non-Technical Summary (the "2014 PEIR 
NTS"). This information accompanied MPL's initial phase of statutory and non-
statutory consultation ("Phase 1 Consultation") with both the local community 
and prescribed consultees.  
1.2.13 The feedback received relating to the 2014 PEIR has helped to inform and 
further refine the EIA process as well as the design and development of the 
Project. Significant changes which have been made to the Project are set out 
in more detail at paragraph 2.2.15.  
1.2.14 As the DCO application for the Project was paused in 2015, MPL is 
undertaking a further round of statutory consultation accompanied by the 
second PEIR which contains updated information on the Project, the design 
parameters, design evolution and the EIA process.

Consultation   
2.1 
Introduction  
2.1.1 The Project is a NSIP under the Planning Act 2008. As a result, the 
consultation process set out in the Planning Act 2008 is being complied with 
for the Project. This section provides an overview of the consultation 
undertaken on the Project to date as part of the Phase 1 Consultation and sets 
out details of the Phase 2 Consultation to be undertaken in 2017.  
2.1.2 More information on the consultation requirements of the Planning Act 2008 
can be found at https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/legislation-
and-advice/advice-notes/ and an explanation of how MPL is consulting with 
the public can be found in the SoCC (please see 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/ for more details).  
2.2 
Phase 1 Consultation 
2.2.1 MPL carried out both statutory and non-statutory consultation as part of its 
work on the first stages of the DCO application process in 2014.  
2.2.2 MPL focused primarily on non-statutory consultation with the local community 
within the Core Consultation Zone ("CCZ") and publicised the Project through 
media coverage across a wider area defined as the Outer Consultation Zone 
("OCZ"). MPL defined both the CCZ and the OCZ in consultation with CBC 
and BBC officers and councillors. The CCZ equates to an approximate 5km 
radius around the Power Generation Plant site and the OCZ equates to a 
10km radius around the Power Generation Plant site. The CCZ is defined by 
parish council boundaries closest to the 5 km radius. Copies of the CCZ and 
OCZ area maps are enclosed at Appendix A and Appendix B respectively.   
2.2.3 An overview of both statutory and non-statutory elements of the Phase 1 
Consultation is provided in the paragraphs below.  
Phase 1 Non-statutory Consultation  
2.2.4 MPL chose to engage with the local community, their political representatives 
and other key stakeholders during an early phase of non-statutory 
consultation, several months in advance of the commencement of the 
statutory consultation phase.   
2.2.5 Stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels as well as local 
community representatives were contacted by MPL and exhibitions were held 
for the benefit of the local community. During this non-statutory phase of 
consultation, MPL explained the rationale and key objectives of the Project, 
gave reasons why the Power Generation Plant Site had been chosen (and its 
need) and presented opportunities for feedback on the emerging project 
concepts.

2.2.6 MPL carried out the following non-statutory consultation activities between 
April 2014 and June 2014, summarised below:  
� 
Meetings held with CBC and BBC regarding consultation approach and 
draft SoCC (“2014 SoCC”) (April - October 2014); 
� 
Meetings held with key stakeholders such as local Members of Parliament, 
English Heritage (now Historic England), Natural England and Parish 
Councils to introduce the outline proposals and provide an understanding 
of local and technical issues of the Project (April - October 2014); 
� 
Publishing the initial plans for the Project for people living in the vicinity of 
the site through a range of media coverage - radio, TV, newspapers, 
websites and social media (May - June 2014); and  
� 
Holding public exhibitions in Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston Moretaine 
to gather the local community's feedback on the initial Project plans and its 
potential impact on the environment, local communities and local 
economy. The public exhibitions were attended by approximately 250 
people (June 2014).   
2.2.7 MPL also undertook further consultation on the scope of the EIA ('the EIA 
Scoping Consultation"). MPL submitted an EIA Scoping Report to PINS in 
June 2014 and received an EIA Scoping Opinion from PINS in July 2014 
which contained the Regulation 9 consultee list; the Secretary of State’s and 
statutory consultees’ opinions on the scope; and methodologies and potential 
effects of the Project to be assessed in the EIA.  
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
2.2.8 Following the non-statutory consultation period, MPL published a draft 2014 
SoCC in July 2014 which was developed in consultation with CBC and BBC. 
The final version of the 2014 SoCC was published on the 23rd September 
2014. 
2.2.9 The 2014 SoCC set out how the PEIR would be publicised and proposed a 
single phase of statutory consultation which aligned with s42 and s48 publicity 
deadlines. MPL sought to maximise the opportunities for consultees to 
comment on the Project by exceeding the minimum statutory timescales of 28 
days.  
2.2.10 During the statutory phase of consultation MPL was able to demonstrate the 
iterative process of project evolution and design development, including how 
the proposals developed since the early non statutory phase of consultation. 
2.2.11 A number of consultation documents were published as part of the 2014 
statutory consultation, these are listed below:

2.2.12 All of the above documents are available to view on the Millbrook Power 
website (http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/key-documents/).  
2.2.13 MPL undertook a series of consultation activities as part of the Phase 1 
Statutory Consultation as summarised below: 
� 
s47 PA 2008- Statutory consultation with BBC and CBC on the content of 
the 2014 SoCC (July-August 2014);  
� 
s47 PA 2008- 2014 SoCC published online (MPL website) and hard 
copies made available for public viewing in local Council offices and 
libraries within the CCZ and OZC. The 2014 SoCC set out how MPL will 
consult the local community living in the vicinity of the Project and how 
they can comment on the proposals (September 2014);  
� 
s48 PA 2008 - Notice publicising the Project in national newspaper to 
publicise the intention to submit a DCO Application (October 2014);  
� 
s46 PA 2008- SoS notified of the proposed DCO Application and supplied 
with all consultation information (October 2014); 
� 
s42 PA 2008- MPL supplied statutory consultees (including prescribed 
persons, local authorities and those with land interests) with consultation 
materials and undertook consultation for a period of 35 days (October-
November 2014);  
� 
s48 PA 2008- Publicised the intention to submit a DCO application for the 
project through a range of media coverage- Radio, TV, Newspapers, 
websites and social media (September –  October 2014);    
� 
s47 PA 2008 - Hard copies of the 2014 PEIR, the 2014 PEIR NTS and 
2014 information leaflet made available for public viewing over the 35-day 
consultation period at local Council offices and libraries in the CCZ and 
OZC; and  
� 
s47 PA 2008 - Public exhibitions held in Marston Moretaine, Stewartby, 
Ampthill and Lidlington to gather the local community’s feedback on the

PEIR, the Project and its impact on the environment, local communities 
and local economy (October - November 2014). 
2.2.14 Following the close of the statutory consultation period, MPL undertook 
additional non-statutory consultation activities. This involved follow up 
meetings with various statutory consultees, a Project update meeting with 
PINS, a Project update meeting with the EA and a meeting with CBC, BBC 
and local parishes. MPL also issued two information updates to the parties 
covered by section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 as well as members of the 
public who requested to be kept informed. The first update explained how 
MPL had made some changes to the Project as a result of statutory 
consultation and the second update reported on the slight amendment to the 
red line boundary.    
2.2.15 MPL had regard to all feedback received during the Phase 1 Statutory 
Consultation and as a result several significant changes to the Project have 
now been made, including:  
� 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (thereby 
avoiding the need for overhead transmission lines and additional 
transmission towers); 
� 
reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a 
maximum of 5 units to only one unit resulting in only one stack; 
� 
reduction in the maximum height of the stacks; 
� 
re-arrangement of generating equipment in order to reduce the potential 
impact of noise on nearby homes; 
� 
re-location of the gas connection site to reduce the potential impact on 
agricultural land; and 
� 
improvement of access arrangements, traffic management measures and 
routing during construction to minimise potential impact on the road 
network.   
2.2.16 Additionally, MPL has undertaken detailed technical and environmental 
studies, and associated design work to refine the design of the plant.  
2.3 
Phase 2 Consultation 
2.3.1 A second phase of statutory public consultation is planned to begin on 29th 
May 2017 and end on 2nd July 2017. This gives a further opportunity to 
comment on the Project.  
2.3.2 MPL is again liaising closely with CBC and BBC. It is also engaging with the 
Parish Councils in the area as well as organisations such as the Environment 
Agency, Natural England and Historic England, to ensure that the Project is

designed, built, operated and maintained to the highest safety and 
environmental standards. 
2.3.3 Over the Phase 2 consultation period, MPL will publish a number of 
documents providing updated information about the Project parameters and 
design evolution. A brief overview of the content of each report is summarised 
below:  
� 
This Project Overview Document; 
� 
SoCC - explains how MPL proposes to consult with residents, businesses 
and other organisations in the vicinity of the Project;  
�

The Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 The "Rookery South RRF Project" is a separate project promoted by Covanta, 
which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. The Rookery 
South RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order"). 
3.1.2 The Project sits within part of the Order limits (i.e. the redline boundary) of the 
RRF Order. This means that there would be an overlap between the RRF 
Order and any DCO that is made by the Secretary of State for the Project.  
3.1.3 MPL has engaged with Covanta throughout the development of the Project 
and is developing its DCO application for the Project in such a way as to allow 
both schemes to co-exist successfully. To do this, MPL intends to submit a 
draft DCO (the 'MPL Draft Order') which would amend the existing RRF Order. 
The amendments would insert protective provisions into the RRF Order for the 
benefit of MPL and further protective provisions into the MPL Draft Order for 
the Project to protect Covanta. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure 
that both projects can proceed without conflict and to ensure that the parties 
co-operate to ensure the best outcome. 
3.1.4 The purpose of this section of the report is to summarise the interrelationship 
between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project, and to explain 
briefly the approach to the provisions that MPL proposes to include in the MPL 
Draft Order to ensure that both schemes can co-exist successfully.  
3.2 
Rookery South RRF Project Background  
3.2.1 The RRF Order permits the construction of an Energy Recovery Facility at 
Rookery South Pit that will be capable of using municipal, commercial and 
non-hazardous industrial residual waste, left after recycling and composting 
efforts, as fuel to generate over 50MWe of heat and electricity.  
3.2.2 During early meetings regarding the Project, both CBC and BBC noted the 
existence of the Rookery South RRF Project and advised that the consultation 
zones for the Project should be broadly of a similar size to those of the 
Rookery South RRF Project. It was also recognised by MPL, from the outset, 
that because of their close proximity, both physically and in terms of their likely 
construction programmes, the interaction between the two schemes would 
need to be dealt with transparently and openly during both non-statutory and 
statutory consultation phases. 
3.3 
Consultation with Covanta 
3.3.1 MPL first carried out non-statutory public consultation relating to the Project in 
May 2014 and June 2014 and statutory consultation in October 2014 and 
Project Overview Document 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
12 
November 2014 as part of the Phase 1 Consultation. The following 
paragraphs set out how and where the interaction between the two schemes 
was reported, and gives details of feedback received relevant to that issue. 
They also explain the further relevant consultation undertaken by MPL 
following the conclusion of the statutory consultation.  
Phase 1 Non-statutory Consultation  
3.3.2 Early non-statutory consultation occurred in May and June 2014. In 
recognition of the need for clarity as expressed above, MPL representatives at 
all exhibitions ensured that when discussing the Project with attendees, they 
made it clear that there was a possibility that (subject to consent) both the 
Rookery South RRF Project and the Project could both be implemented and 
operate at the same or similar times. Subsequent feedback from the 
consultation exercise showed that this possibility was of concern to residents. 
3.3.3 In particular, in response to the consultation question: “Is there anything you 
would like to see done differently at the next round of exhibitions?”, consultees 
expressed concern about the “Relationship with Covanta and creep of 
subsequent growth” (which MPL interpreted as concern about cumulative 
impact); and made requests to “keep [consultees] informed over future 
proposals on the old Covanta project”.  
3.3.4 In response to the above remarks, additional consultation material was 
prepared for the statutory phase of consultation.   
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation  
3.3.5 Further to the concerns expressed by respondents to the non-statutory 
consultation, briefing materials at the formal consultation (section 47) 
exhibitions sought to make clear that an overlap had been identified between 
the boundaries of both the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project, and 
that both could be implemented and operational at the same time if the Project 
was granted Development Consent. The issue of the cumulative impact of 
both projects being brought forward was dealt with in the text of the 
explanatory exhibition boards that were presented at the exhibitions.  
3.3.6 The 2014 PEIR, which formed part of the statutory consultation materials, 
sought to explain the relationship between the Project and the Rookery South 
RRF Project at section 2: 'Project and Site Description' (para 2.2.4 and paras 
2.3.22 - 2.3.25), with cumulative impact with the Rookery South RRF Project 
also being addressed at section 4: 'Environmental Impact Assessment 
Methodology' (paras 4.7.5 - 4.7.7) and then within the topic-specific chapters 
of the 2014 PEIR. This document is available online at 
(www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  
3.3.7 Covanta responded specifically to the section 42 consultation on the 10th 
November 2014 and indicated its willingness to discuss protective provisions 
that might govern the interaction between both projects. Other comments were 
Project Overview Document 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
13 
received from consultees demonstrating knowledge of the relationship 
between the two projects and commenting upon it. These included:  
� 
English Heritage (now Historic England) commenting that the Project was 
modest in comparison with the Rookery South RRF Project but that the 
accumulation of impacts was potentially significant; 
� 
Four additional comments to the effect that the Rookery South RRF 
Project has already been permitted and that the Project would add to the 
cumulative impact in the area; and  
� 
A comment stating that if choice were available then the MPL Project 
would be preferred.  
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation Activities - Post Statutory 
Consultation 
3.3.8 Non-statutory consultation has continued since the Phase 1 statutory 
consultation phase. A number of meetings were held with stakeholders 
including an outreach meeting at the Marston Vale Forest Centre on the 26th 
November 2014. At that meeting it was agreed not to use background data 
from the Rookery South RRF Project application, which was considered to be 
out of date. 
3.3.9 MPL also issued two information updates to the local community and 
prescribed consultees, which explained the principal changes made to the 
Project since statutory consultation. The second information update issued in 
March 2015 dealt specifically with an amendment to the Project's application 
boundary, this amendment was made in order to ensure that both the MPL 
Project and the Rookery South RRF Project could co-exist in Rookery South 
Pit. Additionally, the information update informed consultees of amendments 
to the RRF Order that MPL proposes to make, details of which are set out in 
the following section. 
3.4 
Management of the relationship with the Rookery South RRF Project  
3.4.1 As indicated in the introduction to this section, in order to manage the 
relationship between the two projects, MPL is proposing to include two sets of 
protective provisions within the MPL Draft Order that will be submitted as part 
its DCO application. 
3.4.2 The first set of provisions would be for the benefit of the Rookery South RRF 
Project. These provisions would ensure that MPL consults Covanta before 
submitting certain design details (for example, details relating to the access 
road into the Rookery South Pit), or before exercising certain powers under 
the MPL Draft Order for the Project (for example, powers to access land for 
undertaking street works) where this relates to the land on which Covanta has 
consent to construct the Rookery South RRF Project.  
Project Overview Document 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
14 
3.4.3 This set of provisions would also ensure that MPL and Covanta work together 
on landscaping and ecological mitigation works within the redline boundary of 
the Project, so as to ensure that the mitigation schemes for both projects will 
be compatible and, indeed, will also require MPL and Covanta to work co-
operatively to co-ordinate construction programmes and to try to avoid 
conflicts between the construction of the two schemes to the extent that 
construction happens at the same time. The drafting of these provisions has 
been discussed directly with Covanta and will continue to be negotiated 
following submission, as is the case with the other sets of protective provisions 
that are for the benefit of statutory undertakers. 
3.4.4 The second set of protective provisions would be inserted into the RRF Order 
in the event that the MPL Draft Order for the Project is made by the Secretary 
of State. These protective provisions would protect MPL where Covanta 
wishes to exercise its powers under the RRF Order over the land that is also 
contained within the MPL Order limits. This protection would particularly relate 
to the exercise of the powers in the RRF Order allowing access to land for 
various reasons, including for street works, restricting the use of public rights 
of way, for survey works and for felling or lopping trees. This wording would 
also require MPL and Covanta to work co-operatively to co-ordinate 
construction programmes and to try to avoid conflicts between the carrying out 
of the two schemes to the extent that this happens at the same time. Again, 
this drafting has been discussed directly with Covanta and will continue to be 
negotiated following submission, as is the case with the other sets of 
protective provisions which are for the benefit of other statutory undertakers. 
3.4.5 In addition to drafting the above protective provisions, MPL has also made 
certain minor changes to its own Project since 2015 to better enable both 
projects to co-exist and has also engaged with Covanta as the promoter of the 
Rookery South RRF Project, O&H as the landowner and the two local 
authorities (CBC and BBC). The local community and prescribed consultees' 
views on how MPL has sought to manage this relationship are welcomed as 
part of Phase 2 Consultation.   
3.4.6 It is noted that since the RRF Order was granted, Covanta, the original 
promoter of the Rookery South RRF Project, has entered into a Project 
Development Agreement with Veolia to develop the Rookery South RRF 
pursuant to the RRF Order. On 12th May 2016 Veolia issued a press release 
stating that construction is anticipated to commence "by late 2017 with the 
facility becoming operational in 2020". Managing the relationship between the 
two projects therefore remains of considerable practical importance.

Next Steps 
4.1.1 The Phase 2 Statutory Consultation is scheduled to take place between 29th 
May 2017 and 2nd July 2017 and therefore, MPL welcome views from all 
parties on the Project on or before 5.00pm on 2nd July 2017. The SoCC 
provides further details of the Phase 2 Statutory Consultation and explains the 
ways in which comments can be submitted to MPL (see 
http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/ for more details).  
4.1.2 Following the Phase 2 Statutory Consultation MPL will have regard to all 
consultation responses received in taking forward the detailed technical and 
environmental assessment, and associated design work, in order to refine the 
design of the plant and progress the Project in preparation of the DCO 
application.  
4.1.3 MPL will continue to engage with CBC, BBC, and Parish Councils as well as 
statutory consultees (such as the Environment Agency, Natural England and 
Historic England) on the development of the Project, and to ensure that the 
Project is designed, built, operated and maintained to the highest relevant and 
current safety and environmental standards.  
4.1.4 MPL will also continue to engage with Covanta in order to develop the Project 
in a way which will allow both schemes to successfully coexist.  
4.1.5 MPL anticipates submitting an application for development consent for the 
Project in Q4 2017 with the intention of the application being examined by 
PINS during 2018, to enable a decision from the Secretary of State by mid-
2019.

Dear Sir or Madame,  
 
Millbrook Power Limited: Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr Millbrook, 
Bedfordshire 
Statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
 
Please find below the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST or the Trust) response to 
the Stage Two Consultation for the proposed gas fired power plant near Milbrook. 
EEAST holds no opinion either for or against the proposed gas fired power plant and principle concerns 
to the Trust are those pertaining to generic risk associated with any substantive development, and the 
potential impact upon emergency response and resourcing within the effected locality.  
The NHS Ambulance Service responds to emergency calls made through the 999 system; in addition to 
this the Trust also responds to doctors’ calls and provides a non-emergency patient transport service. 
Assets are deployed at the beginning of each shift with responders being on the road for the majority of 
their duty period; as a regional Ambulance Service any 999 request to attend Millbrook or the 
surrounding villages could see a response being despatched from anywhere in the County or further 
afield. Ambulance resources include rapid response vehicles (RRV), ambulances, managers, community 
first responders (lay volunteers), as well as air ambulances capable of bringing specialist doctors, nurses 
and critical care paramedics to the scene of an emergency.  
There is an expectation from the public that when a 999 call is made to the Ambulance Service, a 
response will be despatched and arrive on scene in a timely manner. The NHS Ambulance Service is 
compelled to work towards Government set response times and targets, and failure to achieve these 
results in detriment to patient care and severe financial penalties being imposed. EEAST works at 98% 
capacity at all times and resources are finite. The current response from EEAST to the areas within and 
around the proposed new build cannot be diminished as a result of the gas fired power plant 
development.  
It is noted by the Trust that although the Phase 2 consultation has refined details under consideration by 
Millbrook Power, the level of in depth detail to permit full evaluation of necessitated mitigation against the 
impacts of the gas fired power plant development to the Ambulance Service and the local populace is 
not available. EEAST understanding is that until final agreement is reached on preferred options (i.e. 
transport and accommodation, medical facilities available to workers etc.) that the Trust will not be able 
to determine specific prerequisites to mollify final preferences. 
Generically the key aspects of concern relate to; 
 
Increase in workforce and associated medical emergencies leading to raised call volume and 
demand – information provided makes reference to only five members of staff working at the 
plant at any one time and 40 additional staff during annual maintenance 
 
Traffic volume increase leading to longer and/or delayed response times – information provided 
references 53 HGV movements and 20 car movements per day during construction 
 
Detriment to the local health economy 
 
 
 
Chief Executive: Robert Morton 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
Chair: Sarah Boulton 
www.eastamb.nhs.uk 
 
 
As the project continues, the Trust will work with Millbrook Power to ensure that potential consequences 
from these options are tapered from an Ambulance and primary healthcare perspective. 
We look forward to working with Millbrook Power and partner agencies through the remainder of the 
consultation process and providing joint review of mitigation proposed to ensure that provision and 
delivery to the public of EEAST services’ within the local area to the development continues to the 
highest possible standard. 
 
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Scanlon 
 
Millbrook Power Limited: Proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit, 
Nr. Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Thank you for consulting us under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 on a proposed 
gas fired power plant at Rookery Pit south. 
 
 
The Proposal 
 
The project comprises a new generation power plant, a new underground gas pipeline 
incorporating an above ground installation at the point of connection and a new 
electrical connection to export power.  There are two options for how the electrical 
connection could be delivered.  The site covers an area of 4 hectares.  The final 
location and layout of the plant are yet to be determined.  They will be finalised post 
consultation having regard to the consultation responses and further studies.  The 
minimum stack height would be 32.5 meters and the maximum stack height would be 
35 meters. 
 
Following the consultations in 2014 several changes have been made including: the 
undergrounding of the electrical connection to the National Grid (avoiding the need for 
overhead transmission lines and additional transmission towers); a reduction in the

number of turbines to one unit with one stack and a reduction in the height of the 
stack. 
 
The consultation notes the design that will form the basis of the application will not be 
a final, detailed design, but one developed using the ‘Rochdale Envelope’.  We 
understand this should ensure all the realistic and likely worse case variations have 
been properly considered, set out and adequately assessed. 
 
The supporting information explains that the proposed Millbrook Power Station would 
co-exist with Covanta’s (or its successor’s) power station in Rookery South pit.  The 
Preliminary Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) includes cumulative effects of the 
project including Rookery South RRF Project, Covanta. 
 
We understand the Rookery is subject to an ongoing low level restoration scheme 
which would take place regardless of the current proposals.  This is to restore the 
former clay workings to low grade agriculture, achieved at low level (below pre 
excavated ground levels).  It would be helpful if the applicant were clear about the 
implications of the land levels on the visibility of the new plant. 
 
 
Historic England Advice on the Preliminary Environmental Impact Report 
 
Visual Material 
 
The project is proposed at and in the area of the former clay extraction pit at Rookery 
South.  It is described in the PEIR Non-Technical Summary in terms of the various 
component parts and the indicative dimensions of main plant items, sub-station and 
electrical connection are given in Table 3.1 in the PEIR.  However, there is little visual 
information to convey the appearance and scale of the plant.  The only visual 
indication of the appearance is as presented in the photomontages in the Landscape 
and Visual Impact (which we understand date from the earlier scheme proposed in 
2014) and Insert 2 in the PEIR Non-Technical Summary.   
  
In order to consider and assess the impacts on the historic environment this visual 
information is essential.  It is particularly difficult to comment on whether the first or 
second option for the Electrical Connection would have a greater impact in the 
absence of this (one involving 2 sealing end compounds and the other one larger 
sealing in compound). We do note that the PEIR notes the effects of both options are 
expected to be substantially the same in heritage terms as the total area for 
development is substantially the same (13.4.3). 
 
The photomontages will be critical for understanding and assessing the impact of the 
development on the setting of the surrounding heritage assets.  A number are 
provided within the PEIR appendices under the Landscape and Visual Impact work.

or EIR applies. 
 
 
 
We understand these photomontages undertaken in 2014.  Some of the viewpoints 
are absent, numbers 5 and 7.  We understand that there will be photomontages to 
allow for the assessment on Houghton House, 4 and 5, and Ampthill Park House, 3 
and 7.  We suggest a further viewpoint from the area around Houghton House would 
be necessary and valuable.  Viewpoint 3 seems to show part of the plant behind a tree 
but this would presumably come into view from other parts of the site.  Even if the 
parts cannot be seen together, both are likely to have an impact and the information 
provided should enable this to be considered.  It would also be helpful to have a 
viewpoint illustrating the impact on the significance of Marston Mortaine church tower.  
With regard to the quality of the photomontages produced, the images in this report 
are very unclear and we assume the when these are updated; they will be of better 
quality. As this is critical to the assessment of the setting of heritage assets please 
ensure that the images are of a suitable quality and high resolution, particularly when 
the documents are enabled for digital dissemination. 
 
The figures include a Zone of Theoretical Visibility.  Again, this figure is not easy to 
read as the map on which it is produced is very faint.  It would be helpful it this could 
be addressed.  
 
Methodology 
 
We have reservations about the assessment methodology of the Report which is dealt 
with in section 4 of the PEIR.  This uses a series of matrices and in order to provide a 
consistent approach across the different environmental components, a general 
structure is provided in tables 4.1-3. In table 4.1 showing a sensitivity matrix, a 
heritage site falls into the category of medium sensitivity.  We consider many of the 
heritage sites under assessment to be of high sensitivity.  We note that for some 
environmental topics the significance criteria may differ.  Within the historic 
environment chapter, it does attribute a high sensitivity to various designated heritage 
assets (table 13.2). 
 
The Historic Environment chapter in the PEIR deals with grade II buildings.  It 
describes the positive contribution of their settings to their significance as ‘generally 
limited to their immediate vicinity,’ (13.5.4).  While we do not wish to comment on the 
impacts on individual grade II buildings, we do not agree that the grading of a building 
reflects the contribution of setting to its significance.  The document continues to note 
that the majority of these grade II buildings are in settlements and do not have a strong 
interaction with the surrounding countryside.  This may be the case but there may be 
others where setting may encompass a wide area and makes a contribution to their 
significance.  For example, the tall chimneys at Stewartby, listed grade II, have a very 
extensive setting as they are visible in long views across the Marston Vale.  
 
The PEIR notes the designated assets were viewed from the closest possible publicly 
accessible location (13.5.9).  Although it continues that this did not lead to any

limitations to the assessment, we have concerns about this approach.  Setting is not 
defined by public access and where there are potentially notable impacts on 
designated heritage assets, efforts should be made to ensure these are properly 
assessed.  This may mean trying to secure access to undertake the assessment.  For 
example, at Ampthill Park House there are likely to be key views from which the 
development should be assessed.  These should include the front steps (and 
potentially the principal rooms within the house) and the area in front of the north of 
the house where there is a statue of a hound.  This provides a focal point and leads 
the eye out to the landscape beyond in the direction of the proposed development. 
This is the same for the scheduled moated sites at Thrupp End and Marston Moritaine 
where a suitable image from the site itself should be provided. 
 
Assessment 
 
With regard to the assessment, the document notes the stack may be seen within the 
settings of designated heritage assets and consequently may have an effect on the 
contribution setting makes to significance (13.7.7).  This impact is considered in detail 
in Appendix 13.2.  However, this is summarised as no more than a slight adverse 
indirect effect and for the majority of assets there would be a neutral indirect effect.  
Those where there is a slight indirect effect are South Pillinge Farm, grade II, Park 
House, grade II*, Ampthill Park, scheduled monument and grade II registered park and 
garden and Houghton House, scheduled monument and grade I (13.7.8).  It notes the 
stack is similar in nature to existing structures in the area. It would appear lower than 
these as it sits within the pit so 20 meters would be visible above ground level (13.7.9).  
It considers the gas and electrical connection would have no impact on the setting of 
designated heritage assets (13.7.14 and 13.7.19).  It is not clear how the impact of the 
sealing end compounds has been considered.  If these are within the pit (their location 
is unclear) they may only just rise above ground level, being 17 metres in height.  If 
they are outside the pit, they are likely to be more visible in the landscape.  While of a 
lower height than the stack, the cumulative impact of this built development on the 
setting and significance of the heritage assets should be considered.  The conclusion 
is that effects on setting are moderate but this effect is based on the contribution of 
setting to significance and not significance itself.  This is not considered to reduce the 
significance of the asset but have a minor magnitude of impact to contribution setting 
makes to significance.  The significance is considered to be largely unaffected or not 
significant (13.10.14).  It would also be helpful if the impacts were considered using 
the language of the National Planning Policy Framework. This requires an assessment 
of harm on the significance of heritage assets.  On an initial assessment of the 
photomontages provided with at PIER stage, we consider there is likely to be notable 
harm to the significance of Ampthill Park, Park House and Houghton House through a 
development within their setting.  
 
The detailed assessment on heritage assets is set out in the table at Appendix 13.2.  
As is explained below, it is difficult to undertake an assessment of the impacts until the

photomontages are updated and further visual information is provided.  However, we 
have general reservations about how the impacts on the highly graded heritage assets 
referred to above have been assessed.  These assessments note the modern 
industrial and transport infrastructure in the Marston Vale and take a view that this 
already compromises the setting of heritage assets.  However, they do not consider 
the potentially harmful cumulative effect of more industrial development in their setting.  
As has been discussed, the effects would need to be considered in terms of levels of 
harm in accordance with the NPPF. 
 
The cumulative impact of the proposed plant together with the consented Covanta 
scheme is considered in the PEIR. There is not considered to be cumulative impact 
with Covanta RRF during construction (13.8.8).  In the operation phase there are 
considered to be not significant effects (13.8.16).  It considers the cumulative and 
combined impacts with Covanta are the same nature and magnitude as the project on 
its own (13.8.17).   Although as we have noted, the photomontages are not particularly 
clear, we consider the cumulative impact of both projects on the significance of 
heritage assets, in particular Park House, Ampthill Park and Houghton House, is likely 
to be harmful. This should be re considered once the photomontages are updated.  
 
Archaeology 
 
We note that the archaeological matters have been considered by the CBC 
archaeologists following an evaluation, the results of which are summarised in the 
report. The report also states that a post DCO programme of works has been agreed. 
We would not wish to comment further on this approach, however would want to note 
that any pre-commencement works such as enabling works or geoarchaeological 
investigations would need to be discussed with the CBC archaeologist and may need 
to be subject to a programme of archaeological work and where necessary an 
archaeological WSI would need to be produced to the approval of CBC archaeological 
team. 
 
 
Next Steps 
 
We hope this letter is helpful in developing the assessment.  We also recommend that 
the ES chapter is amended to take these comments into account, particularly the 
approach to the assessment of significance and harm. We would be happy to discuss 
any of these points with you further.  In particular, it would be useful to consider the 
impact assessments on the individual highly designated heritage assets in more detail 
once additional visual information is available.

Power Project and the Covanta Waste Incineration Project. We are interested in quantitative 
assessment of environmental impact and cumulative effect over time.  
 
(2) The different installation options between the gas and electrical connections which we were 
asked  to  comment  on  seem  to  be  very  minor  and  subtle.  We  accept  that  we  may  have 
misunderstood this point, so some clarification would be appreciated.  
 
(3) There are some concerns regarding the attenuation pond and the risk flooding as well as 
emission to air from the stacks.  
 
I would be grateful if we could either meet in person or have a telephone call to discuss these points. 
This additional information will be given to the council for further discussion.

For the attention of Mr. Dermot Scanlon – Director 
 
Dear Mr Scanlon 
 
Thank you for your letter dated 22nd May 2017.  Marston Moreteyne Parish Council has been asked to 
comment on documents relating to Millbrook Power Limited’s Proposed gas fired power plant at 
Rookery South Pit, Nr. Millbrook, Bedfordshire.  Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning 
Act 2008. 
 
Having reviewed the documents and subsequent information within, Marston Moreteyne Parish Council 
has a number of concerns which are related to emissions and inversion.     
 
Point 3.2.9 within the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (2017) – Non-Technical 
Summary Operation notes that “the main potential effects arising from the operation of the Project are  
associated with the stack emissions arising as a result of the combustion of natural gas in the 
Generating Equipment. Emissions from the stack which have the potential to cause impacts on 
human or ecological receptors are limited to Nitrous Oxides (NOx), which can increase ground 
level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which could impact human receptors or lead to 
nitrogen and acid deposition which could impact sensitive ecological habitats”.    
 
Point 3.2.11 “Air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height which will achieve 
adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits and prevent any likely significant effects to 
identified receptors is between 32.5 m and 35 m. It is concluded that there are expected to be no likely 
significant effects during operation of the Generating Equipment on human or ecological receptors”.   
  
The Parish Council expresses deep concern regarding the potential increase of ground levels of 
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) which could be caused by emissions from the stack and the subsequent 
detrimental impact that this would have upon environmental habitats and effects upon both human life 
and wildlife.   
 
The council would also draw attention to the wording in 3.2.11, especially “it is concluded that there are 
expected to be no likely significant effects during operation ….”.   The council would like to know - 
significant in relation to what?  At what level is a detrimental effect deemed significant? 
 
The proposed site is within the Marston Vale.  The council expresses deep concerns regarding emission 
inversions and the fact that any Nitros Oxide (NO2) gases have the potential to be delayed from being 
dispersed to a specific height and therefore this time delay has the effect that Nitrous Oxide gases could 
fall to the ground with detrimental effects.   
 
The Parish Council feels that the above points warrant further a deeper investigation.   
 
Yours sincerely, 
H. Trustam 
Mrs H. Trustam (Parish Clerk)

Dear Mr Law  
 
We recently received your response to the current Section 42 consultation being carried out in respect of the 
proposed gas fired power plant at Rookery South Pit Nr. Millbrook. Over the last few weeks Milton Keynes Council 
have received two sets of information from PBA in relation to the proposal including a Section 48 notice and a Section 
42 consultation pack.  
 
In your response (attached for ease) you state that the s42 consultation documents will be uploaded to Milton Keynes 
online planning register. We request that these documents are not uploaded to the planning application register since 
these are consultation documents only and this may cause some confusion amongst the public and other consultees. 
 
Instead the Council may wish to publish the S48 notice on the Councils website to help publicise the ongoing public 
consultation. Should the Council wish to submit further comments on the Project, please be aware that the statutory 
consultation period will close on  2nd July 2017.

Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Millbrook Power Limited: Proposed Gas Fired Power Plant at Rookery South Pit, Nr. 
Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Statutory consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
 
This is a joint response by National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET) and National Grid Gas plc 
(NGG) 
 
I refer to your letter dated 22nd May 2017 regarding the above proposed application. Having reviewed 
the section 42 documents, I would like to make the following comments: 
 
National Grid Infrastructure within or in close proximity to the Proposed Order Limits 
 
National Grid Electricity Transmission 
National Grid Electricity Transmission has a high voltage electricity transmission overhead line which 
lies within the proposed order limits. This line forms an essential part of the electricity transmission 
network in England and Wales and include the following: 
 
 
ZA 400kV Overhead Transmission Line – Grendon to Sundon 
 
Electricity Infrastructure: 
 
 
National Grid’s Overhead Line/s is protected by a Deed of Easement/Wayleave Agreement 
which provides full right of access to retain, maintain, repair and inspect our asset 
 
 
Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed buildings 
must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends that no 
permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are set out in 
EN 43 – 8 Technical Specification for “overhead line clearances Issue 3 (2004) and also 
shown in the following National Grid Document:  
http://www2.nationalgrid.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6169  
 
 
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our 
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such 
overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all 
circumstances.

Registered in England and Wales, No 2366977 
Registered in England and Wales, No 2006000 
 
 
 
The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is contained 
within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk) Guidance Note GS 6 “Avoidance 
of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should make sure that they 
are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 metres of 
any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse conditions of 
maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and “swing”) drawings 
should be obtained using the contact details above. 
 
 
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and 
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing 
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety 
clearances. 
 
 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb or 
adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation (“pillar 
of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above 
 
National Grid Electricity Transmission high voltage underground cables are protected by a 
Deed of Grant; Easement; Wayleave Agreement or the provisions of the New Roads and 
Street Works Act. These provisions provide National Grid full right of access to retain, 
maintain, repair and inspect our assets. Hence we require that no permanent / temporary 
structures are to be built over our cables or within the easement strip. Any such proposals 
should be discussed and agreed with National Grid prior to any works taking place.  
 
 
Ground levels above our cables must not be altered in any way. Any alterations to the depth of 
our cables will subsequently alter the rating of the circuit and can compromise the reliability, 
efficiency and safety of our electricity network and requires consultation with National Grid 
prior to any such changes in both level and construction being implemented. 
 
National Grid Gas Transmission  
 
National Grid has three high pressure gas transmission pipelines located within the proposed order 
limits. The high pressure gas pipelines located within this area are: 
 
 
FM09- Huntingdon- Steppingley 
 
FM26- Huntington- Steppingley 
 
FM07- Old Warden- Chalgrove 
 
I enclose plans showing the routes of our overhead line and gas transmission pipelines.

 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the erection 
of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground levels, storage of 
materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline at 
previously agreed locations.  
 
 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.  
 
 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be installed 
over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National Grid.  
 
 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of the 
proposed protective measure.  
 
 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the pipeline to 
comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22. 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement 
 
Cables Crossing: 
 
 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline. 
 
 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is above 
the pipeline. 
 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres between 
the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If this cannot be 
achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance distance of 0.6 metres.

General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and after 
construction.  
 
 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased. 
 
 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established on 
site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed prior to 
any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final depth of 
cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the supervision 
of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power tools is not 
permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with NG 
supervision and guidance.

Dear Mr Scanlon 
 
Section 42 Planning Act 2008 consultation: Proposed gas fired power plant 
Location: Rookery South Pit, Nr.Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
 
Thank you for your consultation which was received by Natural England on 22 May 2017. 
 
Natural England is a non-departmental public body. Our statutory purpose is to ensure that the 
natural environment is conserved, enhanced, and managed for the benefit of present and future 
generations, thereby contributing to sustainable development.  
 
 
Natural England advises that air quality impacts from the proposal will not impact upon 
King’s Wood and Glebe Meadows Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or Coopers Hill 
SSSI. However, further information is required regarding protected species and soil and land 
quality. 
 
 
We understand that you are consulting us in line with paragraph 67 of the Planning Act 2008 
“Guidance on pre-application consultation”, and that further consultation may be required in line with 
paragraph 85, particularly if/when the draft Environmental Statement has been prepared. We also 
appreciate that this consultation under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 also encompasses 
consultation on the preliminary environmental information, and that some overlap exists between 
these various requirements. Natural England welcomes both formal and informal pre application 
consultation and refers you to Annex C to the NID advice note 11. 
 
We provided advice on 18 July 2014 (our ref: 124328) to the Secretary of State on the scope of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) where we advised we were broadly happy with the 
approach outlined for the EIA. We also provided advice on an earlier version of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (hereafter the ‘PEIR’) on 29 October 2014 (our ref: 133972, your 
ref: PGW/MPL). We now acknowledge receipt of the Section 48 Notice of proposed application for a 
Development Consent Order that you have provided. We have examined the PEIR (by Peter Brett 
Associates, Project Ref: 40335 Rev: 1.0, dated May 2017) and we provide further information in 
Annex A. 
 
We would be happy to comment further through our Discretionary Advice Service should the need 
arise but if in the meantime you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us. For any 
queries relating to the specific advice in this letter only please contact me on 0208 225 7685. For 
any new consultations, or to provide further information on this consultation please send your 
correspondences to consultations@naturalengland.org.uk. 
 
We really value your feedback to help us improve the service we offer. We have attached a 
Page 2 of 4 
 
feedback form to this letter and welcome any comments you might have about our service.  
 
Yours sincerely

Annex A – Additional information 
 
Designated Sites  
Air Quality 
In our advice of 29 October 2014 we advised that modelled process contributions for nearby SSSIs 
were required to determine whether there would be adverse impacts. The PEIR now provide values 
for the process contributions (PCs) at ecological receptors, including the two nearby SSSIs. The 
proposed power plant will result in the emission of oxides of nitrogen and we are aware that a 
Resource Recovery Facility (the Covanta waste incineration plant) is proposed nearby. We 
acknowledge at para 4.10.8 of the PEIR that a ‘worst case’ scenario assessment of the potential 
impacts from air quality has been undertaken. Note that we have not checked the validity of the 
Covanta air quality data, only the cumulative modelling that you have undertaken. We note that your 
assessment has used Air Pollution Information System http://www.apis.ac.uk/ to determine existing 
nitrogen and acid deposition rates within the study area, and that the air quality assessment has 
used an appropriate ADMS 5 model (described in para 6.5.20 of the PEIR). 
 
Volume D of the PEIR considers the potential impacts on King’s Wood and Glebe Meadows SSSI 
and Coopers Hill SSSI as ecological receptors and uses air quality modelling to assess the impact 
of the proposal on the three habitat features of the two SSSIs. See our advice below on potential 
impacts to European Sites. Natural England is satisfied that there would not be any adverse effects 
to SSSIs through the construction or decommissioning stages: the main potential for impact to 
SSSIs would be through changes in air quality during operation of the power plant. In considering 
the operation of the power plant we note the results in Table A6 of pollutant concentrations and in 
Table A8 of nitrogen deposition and we conclude that the proposal will not impact upon King’s 
Wood and Glebe Meadows SSSI or Coopers Hill SSSI. Our reasoning is because screening has 
indicated that the process contribution (PC) for all pollutants at all sites will be <1% of the relevant 
critical level or load for the most sensitive habitat at each site. 
 
European Sites 
We note that the Habitat Regulations Assessment: No Significant Effects Report (by Peter Brett 
Associates, Project Ref: 31116/001 Rev: AA, Dated March 2015) has been produced to record a 
Habitats Regulations assessment. We confirm our previous advice (email from Ross Holdgate on 2 
March 2015) that there would be no likely significant effects to Chiltern Beechwoods Special Area of 
Conservation, Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area and Ramsar Site, either alone 
or in combination with other plans or projects. 
 
 
Protected Species  
We note that Volume F Ecology contains the Herpetofauna Report dated 2 December 2014 and we 
understand that great crested newt (GCN) exclusion fence (that was part of the licence 2014-1762-
EPS-MIT-1) as part of previous translocation work will remain on site until April 2018. We also 
understand from Hayley Scoffham (email dated 13 June 2017) that “no material changes in the 
nature and extent of the habitats were identified during the survey, and no further survey 
requirements were identified to inform the DCO application.”  We are concerned that if this fence 
is taken down before the DCO works commence then there is likelihood that GCNs may 
access the site. We require further information as to why it is considered that no further 
surveys for GCNs are required. This echoes the guidance provided by the Secretary of State in 
the Scoping Opinion of the Proposed Millbrook Power Project (July 2014) at para 3.47 that 
“ecological surveys should be thorough, up to date and take account of other developments 
proposed in the vicinity.” 
 
We also note the presence of other protected species including bats and badgers within the 
proposal area. Should the development involve a requirement for any protected species licences to 
be issued by Natural England it is important that the details are agreed with us at an early stage, to 
ensure that Letters of No Impediment can be issued with submission.

Soils and Agricultural Land  
Detailed information on Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) Grade is not supplied in the PEIR. 
Further, we note at para 5.7.7 of the Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report (dated 
June 2014, Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 10) that the vicinity of Rookery South Pit is located 
within agricultural fields classified as ALC Grade 3. In our previous advice of 29 October 2014 we 
recommended that “that the area of agricultural land to be affected by the works is quantified”. We 
understand from an email of 27 June 2017 from Hayley Scoffham of Peter Brett Associates that the 
following land areas are involved: 
 
 
The Gas Connection is 6.25ha; 
 
The Electrical Connection is 19.07ha; 
 
We acknowledge that a certain area within the Gas Connection comprises the pipeline itself, and 
likewise within the Electrical Connection the cable itself, and that such areas will be re-instated after 
installation. Further we understand that the laydown area (~4ha) and the substation (~3ha) are sited 
in brownfield land (the base of the former clay pit). However, in order to assess the significance of 
the impact of the Gas and Electrical Connections, Natural England recommends it is necessary 
to undertake an agricultural land quality and soil resources survey of the site – particularly 
any areas of land  that will not be re-instated or are likely to suffer permanent loss. This would 
identify whether best and most versatile land is affected and if so to what extent. The survey should 
also inform the methodology for soil handling during the works. To safeguard soil resources as part 
of the overall sustainability of the development, it is important that the soil is able to retain as many 
of its many important functions and services (ecosystem services) as possible through careful soil 
management.

Dear Dermot Scanlon 
 
Rookery South Pit, Millbrook, Bedfordshire 
DCO for Millbrook Power Station – gas-fired power station 
Drax Group PLC 
501373 / 240736 
 
Network Rail has the following comments to make on the above DCO proposal and development. 
 
Network Rail has been consulted on the Millbrook Power Project, a proposal to develop a new gas power 
station on land to the east of the railway between Stewartby and Millbrook stations, in Bedfordshire.  The 
project will be subject to a DCO application to be submitted in late 2017. 
 
Whilst at this stage we do not believe that the proposal requires any Network Rail land/assets to be included 
within the red line boundary, it is highly likely that the proposed new access roads off Green Lane in 
Stewartby and Station Lane in Millbrook will have an impact on the 2 Level Crossings located on both these 
roads.   
 
The information provided at this stage suggests that during construction there would be 78 HGV movements 
and 80 car movements per day.  Some of the equipment would be large and potentially disruptive.  During 
operation, the developer envisages approximately 5 employees plus maintenance visits.  An annual month 
long maintenance outage would attract an additional 40 staff and 4 HGV movements daily for that period. 
 
The report submitted to Network Rail for this consultation does not discuss or mention the potential impact 
on the level crossings of the proposal. 
 
(1) 
In 2015, the Network Rail Level Crossings Manager for the area, was consulted on initial proposals and 
raised concerns that the entrance to the development was approximately 150 metres from Stewartby Green 
Lane Level Crossing. There was concern that the construction traffic could cause blocking back at the level 
crossing and discussions included traffic management control to mitigate any impacts from the construction 
phase. There was also a proposal to re-model a section of Green Lane where the new access road would 
join it. 
 
(a) The developer should continue to liaise with Network Rail’s Level Crossing Manager to ensure that 
the construction works on site do not impact upon the safe operation and integrity of the Stewartby 
Network Rail Infrastructure Limited   Registered Office: Network Rail, 2nd Floor, One Eversholt Street, London, NW1 2DN    Registered in England and Wales No. 2904587   www.networkrail.co.uk 
 
 
 
Green Lane Level Crossing and Millbrook Level Crossing.  
(b) A good traffic management control scheme must be included within the construction works phase to 
remove any issues of blocking back due to the additional traffic and construction traffic generated by 
the proposal.  
(c) The developer should also consider the potential impacts of the proposal not only during construction 
but also once the proposal is up and running (should it be granted planning consent).  
 
As the proposal progresses the impact of construction works on site and impacts from the proposal once in 
operation on Network Rail’s level crossings should be considered within the Transport Assessment.  
 
Any mitigation measures required at the level crossings would need to be fully funded by the developer and 
agreed with Network Rail. 
 
An addendum to this letter includes a list of asset protection issues and measures to be actioned by the 
developer. 
 
If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
 
Yours sincerely

Asset Protection Appendix 
 
 
Network Rail has the following comments on asset protection issues as the proposal is adjacent to the 
operational railway line. 
 
(1) 
Network Rail’s Asset Protection Engineer has already informed the developer that they have reviewed the 
new access road within the site, which runs adjacent to the railway boundary. The developer has been 
advised that there must be no disturbance to the operational railway infrastructure and that the developer 
will need to provide: 
 
• 
suitable trespass proof fence of at least 1.8m in height   
• 
directional column lighting  
• 
adequate anti incursion barriers – especially in view of the increase in HGVs  
• 
surface water drainage away from the railway boundary 
 
 
(2) 
Network Rail has been advised that the developer may want to install an Under Track Crossing (UTX) – this 
would need to be agreed with Network Rail including any wayleaves etc. 
 
(3) 
As the proposal includes works which may impact the existing operational railway and in order to facilitate 
the above, a BAPA (Basic Asset Protection Agreement) will need to be agreed between the developer and 
Network Rail. The developer will be liable for all costs incurred by Network Rail in facilitating this proposal, 
including any railway site safety costs, possession costs, asset protection costs / presence, site visits, review 
and agreement of proposal documents and any buried services searches. The BAPA will be in addition to 
any planning consent. 
 
The applicant / developer should liaise directly with Asset Protection to set up the BAPA. 
 
For major works / large scale developments an Asset Protection Agreement will be required with further 
specific requirements.

Section 42 Consultation 
 
Thank you for your consultation regarding the above development. Public Health 
England (PHE) welcomes the opportunity to comment on your proposals and 
preliminary environmental information report at this stage of the project 
 
Our records indicate that we have replied to earlier consultations as listed below and 
this response should be read in conjunction with that earlier correspondence. 
 Request for Scoping Opinion 
17th July 2014 
 Section 42   
 
 
14th November 2014 
 
PHE has considered the submitted documentation and can confirm that we are 
broadly satisfied with the approach proposed for the preparation of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information  Report  (PEIR).  
 
However, PHE notes that there is currently only a preliminary assessment of the 
potential impacts of electric and magnetic fields (EMFs). PHE will require the 
promoter to demonstrate that risks from EMFs have been fully considered and that 
any necessary risk assessment has been undertaken. Further information on the 
codes of practice in carrying out a full assessment can be found here:

Millbrook Power Station  
Response to statutory consultation under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 
Introduction 
Reference the letter from Peter Brett Associates on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited to Royal Mail dated 22 
May 2017, Royal Mail’s consultants BNP Paribas Real Estate have reviewed the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) dated May 2017.   
Royal Mail’s consultation response is set out below.  It is requested that Millbrook Power has due regard to 
this consultation response in progressing the Power Station proposal and forthcoming DCO application.  
Royal Mail – relevant information 
Royal Mail is responsible for providing efficient mail sorting and delivery nationally.  As the Universal Service 
Provider under the Postal Services Act 2011, Royal Mail has a statutory duty to deliver mail to every residential 
and business address in the country as well as collecting mail from all Post Offices and post boxes six days a 
week. 
Royal Mail’s postal sorting and delivery operations rely heavily on road communications.   Royal Mail’s ability 
to provide efficient mail collection, sorting and delivery to the public is sensitive to changes in the capacity of 
the highway network.  
Royal Mail is a major road user nationally.  Disruption to the highway network and traffic delays can have 
direct consequences on Royal Mail’s operations, its ability to meet the Universal Service Obligation and comply 
with the regulatory regime for postal services thereby presenting a significant risk to Royal Mail’s business.   
Royal Mail has a Delivery Office at Ampthill which is circa 3.1 miles from the proposed Millbrook Power Station 
and three other operational facilities within a 10 mile radius of the proposal site, as listed and shown on the 
plan below: 
Ampthill Delivery Office 
MK45 2QW 
3.1 miles 
Ampthill Vehicle Park 
MK45 2RB 
3.2 miles 
Bedford Prebend Street 
Vehicle Park 
MK42 9BX 
7.8 miles 
Bedford Delivery Office 
MK40 1AA 
9.0 miles 
Milton Keynes 
Parcelforce  
MK15 8HG 
12.6 miles 
Milton Keynes Delivery 
Office 
MK11 3AA 
17.4 miles 
 
 
 
2 
 
 
In exercising its statutory duties Royal Mail vehicles use on a daily basis all of the main roads that may 
potentially be affected by additional traffic arising from the construction of the proposed new Millbrook Power 
Station.  In particular, the section of the A421 between junction 13 of the M1 Motorway and Bedford is of 
strategic importance to Royal Mail’s services to Bedford and the surrounding area.   
Royal Mail therefore wishes to ensure the protection of its future ability to provide an efficient mail sorting 
and delivery service to the public in accordance with its statutory obligations which may potentially be 
adversely affected by the construction of this proposed scheme.   
Comments / observations on the applicant’s PEIR 
 
Royal Mail notes from the PEIR that following ES scoping consultations in 2014 and subsequent traffic surveys, 
Millbrook Power limited has prepared a TA and a draft Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP), 
with a Travel Plan to be prepared and submitted with the DCO application.   
 
The PEIR indicates that the construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed Power Station has 
potential to affect the local transport network through the generation of additional traffic movements to the 
area in the vicinity of the proposal site. 
 
It is noted by Royal Mail that in addition to the CEMP, a contractor’s Route Management Plan will be agreed at 
the detailed design stage of the project.   
 
Royal Mail’s comments / requests: 
1. Royal Mail requests that the ES includes information on the needs of major road users (such as Royal 
Mail) and acknowledges the requirement to ensure that major road users are not disrupted though 
full advance consultation by the applicant at the appropriate time in the DCO and development 
process.    
 
 
 
3 
 
2. The ES should include detailed information on the construction traffic mitigation measures that are 
proposed to be implemented, including a draft Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) in 
addition to the CEMP and Contractor’s Route Management Plan. 
 
3. Royal Mail requests that it is fully pre-consulted by Millbrook Power on any proposed road closures/ 
diversions/ alternative access arrangements, hours of working and the content of the CEMP, CTMP 
and the Contractor’s Route Management Plan.   
Royal Mail is able to supply the applicant with information on its road usage/ trips if required.  
Should Millbrook Power Limited or Peter Brett Associates have any queries in relation to the above, then in the 
first instance please contact Jennifer Douglas (jennifer.douglas@royalmail.com) of Royal Mail’s Legal Services 
Team or Daniel Parry-Jones (daniel.parry-jones@bnpparibas.com) of BNP Paribas Real Estate.

I am aware I have missed the deadline  for the public exhibitions  and also the response date 
to the proposed project  , This is unfortunate because I need more information on how this 
proposal relates to us????    Is it just courtesy to inform all in the surrounding  area.  or is our 
land specific  to your proposal??  As you can gather I am not up to speed!!!  
 
If you could update /inform me  it would be appreciated

Site Specific Comments 
The site is located entirely within Flood Zone 1 (lowest probability of flooding) on our 
Flood Map. The site is underlain by the solid bedrock geology of the Oxford Clay 
Formation (unproductive strata). This geological strata is underlain by the Kellaways 
Sand (Secondary A Aquifer) and Blisworth Limestone Formation (Principal Aquifer). 
A small part of the western area of the site overlies a Secondary A Aquifer in the 
alluvium superficial deposits. Secondary aquifers are permeable geological strata 
capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and often 
form an important source of base flow to rivers, wetlands and lakes and private water 
supplies in rural areas. 
 
 
According to the site investigation works, as documented in the report no.1, 
groundwater beneath the site is shallow (lying within 5 metres) in the strata directly 
beneath the site. The overlying soils across the site are classified as having a wide 
range (low to high) of leaching potentials, meaning they can readily transmit a wide 
variety of pollutants to the groundwater. Various streams, surface water drains, 
ponds and lakes are located on the site and adjacent to the site. 
  
The site is considered to be of moderate sensitivity and could present potential 
pollutant/contaminant linkages to controlled waters. 
 
Flood Risk and Surface Water Drainage 
Please contact the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) and the Internal Drainage 
Board (IDB) for drainage advice.       
  
Land Contamination and Groundwater Protection 
We understand that potentially contaminative activities, including landfilling and 
industrial works for the manufacture of electrical equipment and the use of the site 
for brickmaking, have previously been undertaken at the site. Furthermore, the site 
lies adjacent to a brickworks site, a landfill and railway lines. 
  
We understand from report no.3 above and Figure 2 (Site Layout and Exploratory 
hole Location Plan) of the report that extensive site intrusive investigation works 
have been carried out at the site. From the results of groundwater and surface water 
testing, we understand that elevated concentrations of Extractable Petroleum 
Hydrocarbons (EPH) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected in 
BH206 from a groundwater sample collected from the Kellaways Sands Secondary A 
Aquifer. The report concludes that the elevated EPH concentrations are due to 
entrained sediment content that has originated from the organic rich Oxford Clay. 
Based on the known previous site uses, we would require robust lines of evidence to 
discount anthropogenic activities being the source of the identified contamination. 
Therefore, we welcome the proposed Phase 2 geo-environmental intrusive 
investigation in the ‘Generating Equipment Area’ of the site. Furthermore, we require 
a better understanding of the sensitivity, and a suitable risk assessment, of the 
Secondary A and Principal Aquifers beneath the site. 
  
We noted that Appendix 4 of the of report No.3 only includes select borehole and 
trial pit logs. We would require borehole logs for all of the trial pits and boreholes 
which were installed during the site investigation works. 
  
Based on the identified low risk of the proposed development to controlled waters in 
the ‘Electrical Connection Area’ of the site, it has been proposed that further works 
are not required in this area. We are in agreement with this proposed approach. 
Depending on the outcome from the proposed works in the ‘Generating Equipment 
Area’, we may require additional site investigation works to provide robust lines of 
evidence that the risks to controlled waters are low. 
  
We are in agreement with the proposed groundwater and surface water monitoring 
programme that is proposed for the site. 
  
We recommend that any information collected is used to inform the Site Condition 
Report which would support any permit application(s) at this site. 
 
 
 
Piling 
Piling or other ground penetrative methods could have an adverse impact on the 
groundwater quality within the Principal Aquifer and Secondary A Aquifers beneath 
the site or provide preferential pathways for contaminant migration to the aquifer 
during construction and after the completion of the development. A Foundation 
Works Risk Assessment (FWRA) will need to be produced to determine the risks to 
the underlying aquifers from proposed possible piled foundations. 
 
Infiltration Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) 
We understand that due to the ground conditions of the site, that infiltration SuDS 
are not being considered as part of the proposed development. If this is not the case 
then you should be aware that we will require a risk assessment for any infiltration 
systems that are proposed. We recommend that information from the intrusive site 
investigation works be used to inform any risk assessment. Please refer to our 
general advice (below) with regards to infiltration drainage: 
 
 
Infiltration sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) such as soakaways, 
unsealed porous pavement systems or infiltration basins shall only be used 
where it can be demonstrated that they will not pose a risk to the water 
environment. 
 
 
Infiltration SuDS have the potential to provide a pathway for pollutants and 
must not be constructed in contaminated ground. They would only be 
acceptable if a phased site investigation showed the presence of no 
significant contamination. 
 
 
Only clean water from roofs can be directly discharged to any soakaway or 
watercourse. Systems for the discharge of surface water from associated 
hard-standing, roads and impermeable vehicle parking areas shall incorporate 
appropriate pollution prevention measures and a suitable number of SuDS 
treatment train components appropriate to the environmental sensitivity of the 
receiving waters. 
 
 
The maximum acceptable depth for infiltration SuDS is 2.0 m below ground 
level, with a minimum of 1.2 m clearance between the base of infiltration 
SuDS and peak seasonal groundwater levels. 
 
 
Deep bore and other deep soakaway systems are not appropriate in areas 
where groundwater constitutes a significant resource (that is where aquifer 
yield may support or already supports abstraction). 
 
 
SuDS should be constructed in line with good practice and guidance 
documents which include the SuDS Manual (CIRIA C753, 2015) and the 
Susdrain website. 
 
For further information on our requirements with regard to SuDS see our 
groundwater protection position statements, in particular Position Statements G1 and 
G9 to G13 available at:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/groundwater-
protection-position-statements 
 
 
 
 
 
Pollution Prevention  
At this stage of the process there is limited information on the surface water and foul 
sewage disposal for both the proposed Power Station and the Laydown Area to be 
used during construction. We would wish to see more information in this respect.  
 
 A separate Consent may be required from us for any proposed trade or 
sewage effluent discharge to a watercourse or other controlled waters (or to 
soakaway if notice has been given by us of "relevant prohibition") under the 
provisions of Schedule 10 of the Water Resources Act 1991. Controlled water 
includes stream, underground waters, reservoirs, estuaries and coastal 
waters. This would also include the 'Laydown Area'. 
 
 Prior to being discharged into any watercourse, surface water sewer or 
soakaway system, all surface water drainage from lorry parks and/or parking 
areas for fifty car park spaces or more and hardstandings should be passed 
through an oil interceptor designed compatible with the site being drained. 
Roof water shall not pass through the interceptor. 
  
Prior to being discharged into any watercourse, surface water sewer or 
soakaway system, all surface water drainage from parking areas for less than 
fifty spaces and hardstandings should be passed through trapped gullies with 
an overall capacity compatible with the site being drained. 
 
 For more general information on pollution prevention can be obtained from the 
government website at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pollution-prevention-for-
businesses 
 
Waste 
Reference has been made to local planning policies. The policies contained in these 
strategies should be used as a clear reference point, to ensure waste is managed 
sustainably and legally. We would refer the applicant to the Construction Code of 
Practice for the Sustainable use of Soils on Construction 
Sites:   https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file
/69308/pb13298-code-of-practice-090910.pdf. There is further guidance on 
sustainable construction available on the Waste and Resources Action Programme 
website: www.wrap.org.uk 
 
Water Resources  
The development lies within the area traditionally supplied by Anglian Water 
Services Ltd. It is assumed that water will be supplied using existing sources and 
under existing abstraction licence permissions. Advice should be sought from the 
water company to find out whether this is the case, or whether a new source needs 
to be developed or a new abstraction licence is sought. We may not be able to 
recommend a new or increased abstraction licence where water resources are fully 
committed to existing abstraction and the environment. 
 
The timing and cost of infrastructure improvements will be a consideration. This 
issue should be discussed with the water company. 
 
We supports all initiatives aimed at reducing water use. The extent of water 
efficiency measures adopted will affect the demand for water for the development 
and I would expect that this will be taken into consideration. It is assumed that new 
 
 
houses will be constructed with water meters fitted. Other water saving measures 
that we wish to see incorporated include low flush toilets, low flow showerheads, 
water butts for gardens etc. We support the idea of greywater recycling as it has the 
potential to reduce water consumption in the average household by up to 35%. This 
must, however, be achieved in a safe and hygienic manner. 
  
It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that no local water features 
(including streams, ponds, lakes, ditches or drains) are detrimentally affected, this 
includes both licensed and unlicensed abstractions. If the proposal requires an 
abstraction licence, it is recommended that the applicant contact the local 
Environment Agency Office. Depending on water resources availability a licence may 
not be able to be granted. 
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING (ENGLAND AND WALES) REGULATIONS 
2016  
 
 
Regulation  
The development proposal is at an early stage and as such only limited information 
has been provided so far. The applicant is advised to refer to The Environmental 
Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (EPR), Schedule 1, Part 2, 
Chapter 1, Section 1.1 Combustion Activities: 
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1154/made 
 
The operator will need to ensure that a suitable environmental permit is in place 
before commencement of operations. This proposal has no current permit and we 
recommend that the applicant commences pre-application discussions for a permit 
as soon as is practicable by contacting the local Combustion Sector Lead within the 
East Anglia Installations Team. Guidance on applying for a new environmental 
permit or varying an existing environmental permit can be found at: 
https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-management/environmental-permits 
 
Permit Application  
Our determination of an environmental permit application will address a number of 
key areas, including: 
 
 Management: - including general management, accident management, energy 
efficiency, efficient use of raw materials and waste recovery 
 Operating activities and techniques: - including the use of Best Available 
Techniques for process design and management; 
 Emission Monitoring EN14181 requirements; 
 Secondary and Tertiary containment; 
 Combined Heat and Power; 
 Carbon capture and Sequestration (if applicable); 
 Eels and Fish Passage Management (if applicable); 
 Emissions to air and discharges to water, land and groundwater along with odour, 
noise and vibration; 
 Information: - monitoring, records, reporting and notifications. 
 
The applicant will need to demonstrate the use of Best Available Techniques (BAT). 
BAT is required to be considered in order to avoid or reduce emissions resulting from 
 
 
certain installations and to reduce the impact on the environment as a whole. Use of 
BAT is required by us when licensing the major potentially polluting industries under 
the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2016. 
 
When determining the application for a permit to operate we will set conditions to 
ensure the emissions and discharges are at a level that will not result in significant 
impact on people and the environment, reflecting current statutory requirements and 
to ensure compliance with European Directive 2010/75/EU on Industrial Emissions. 
We cannot grant a permit until we are satisfied that the operation of the process will 
not cause significant pollution to the environment or harm to human health in 
isolation or in combination with relevant neighbouring emission sources. We note 
that Millbrook Power Limited has engaged with Covanta, the operator of the 
proposed Energy from Waste plant, and is developing its DCO application for the 
Project in such a way as to allow both schemes to co-exist. 
 
For the purposes of a permit application we expect the applicant to refer to the BAT 
Reference conclusion document for large combustion plants that was adopted by the 
Article 75 Committee of the European Commission on the 28 April 2017 which this 
application will be assessed against when it is published later this year. Current BAT 
guidance can be viewed at: http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference 
 
Parallel Tracking  
You may wish to consider parallel tracking the DCO and permit applications for this 
project to give us the opportunity of identifying any key issues of concern and to 
enable these to be clarified at the earliest opportunity. We feel it is important to 
clarify that whilst the applicant is permitted to make applications sequentially (there is 
no legal requirement not to do so), our future responses to planning enquiries may 
be limited. 
It should be noted that an EPR application would include a more detailed technical 
assessment of operation of the installation than might be provided for the DCO 
response. The future submission for a permit under EPR may require alterations and 
amendments to the current project proposal which we currently cannot foresee. This 
is one of the reasons why parallel tracking of applications may be of benefit. This 
approach can help to reduce uncertainty as to whether the activity is likely to be 
permitted, which in turn can reduce uncertainty and promote faster decision making 
for both planning and permitting applications. Our guidance on development 
requiring both planning permission and environmental permits can be found at: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developments-requiring-planning-
permission-and-environmental-permits 
 
Energy Efficiency and Cooling  
Although we recognise that this proposal is for an open cycle plant, and will operated 
as peaking plant, we expect energy efficiency to form a significant part of your 
application to ensure that operations will take into account BAT for this type of 
combustion plant. 
 
Air Quality Assessment  
The operation of the power station will result in the emission of oxides of nitrogen 
and oxides of carbon. Air Quality assessment and its impact on any relevant Air 
Quality Management Areas (AQMA) will be completed during a permit determination 
of the relevant air quality modelling files. We suggest that the operator clarifies the 
scope of any air quality modelling that will be completed for the DCO with the 
 
 
Combustion Lead for the Installations Team as BAT requirements on Energy 
Efficiency will have to be taken into account along with in combination (cumulative) 
impacts from other relevant emission sources such as the proposed Energy from 
Waste plant. 
 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Readiness  
We require all new combustion power plants (that do not include CHP from the 
outset) to be CHP-ready to a sufficient degree dictated by the likely future 
technically- viable opportunities for heat supply in the vicinity of the plant. 
 
Environmental permit applications for closed cycle, base load, gas turbines would 
require the need to include a Best Available Technique (BAT) assessment for CHP-
readiness, for which we have produced a guidance note: - ‘CHP Ready Guidance for 
Combustion and Energy from Waste Power Plants’ V1.0 February 2013: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-efficiency-for-combustion-and-
energy-from-waste-power-plants 
As a result peaking plant will be required to demonstrate why more efficient plant 
have not been identified as BAT and may be operationally limited, through a permit 
condition, to a maximum number of hours per annum if considered BAT for this 
mode of operation. 
 
Carbon Capture Readiness  
The Carbon Capture Readiness (Electricity Generating Stations) Regulations 2013 
require that Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) to be assessed during the consenting 
process and that no new power station at or over 300MWe will be consented unless 
it can be demonstrated to be carbon capture ready. We would require confirmation 
that the maximum electrical output from this plant would not meet this threshold. 
The CCR requirements at the application stage include demonstration that there is 
sufficient space, it is technically and economically feasible to retrofit the chosen 
technology and that transport and storage of CO2 is feasible. Full details of these 
requirements are in ‘Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR). A guidance note for Section 
36 of the Electricity Act 1989 consent applications. DECC, URN 09D/810 November 
2009’. This will be assessed by the Environment Agency when submitted if the 
above threshold is crossed. https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/system/files/publications/ccs-
reports/DECC_CCS_133.pdf 
 
It should be noted that we are only able to comment on the suitability of the space 
set aside on or near the site for carbon capture equipment and the technical 
feasibility of the retrofitting carbon capture equipment. As explained in paragraph 94 
of the DECC CCR guidance we are not the public body to comment on the technical 
aspects of the transport and storage of CO2 off site, nor can we comment on the 
soundness of the economic feasibility of the CCS proposal. However, we will require 
further information, if required, to be submitted as part of the EPR permit application 
to allow us to assess the project to determine that there are no foreseeable barriers 
to the technical feasibility of CCR retrofit. 
 
The submission of the above mentioned information as part of the DCO application 
may address any uncertainties over whether amendments to the project would be 
required post DCO determination if an EPR permit application is not determined in 
parallel

PLANNING HISTORY 
None relevant 
 
THE SITE AND SURROUNDINGS 
The site comprises two large former clay pits, known as Rookery North and Rookery 
South Pits which are separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated clay. The area 
is designated as Rookery Clay Pits County Wildlife Site (CWS). 
 
The pits are approximately 3km north of Ampthill, and 7km south west of Bedford 
situated in the Marston Vale. The nearest villages to the site are Stewartby (400m to 
the north), Millbrook (400m to the south), Houghton Conquest (1.5km to the north 
east) and Marston Moretaine 1.2km to the west) in Bedfordshire. Railway lines 
extend along both the east and west site boundaries. 
 
The majority of the application site is within the boundary of Central Bedfordshire 
Council. However, a section of the northern boundary is within Bedford Borough 
Councils administrative area. 
 
Road access to the site is currently from the north near Stewartby via the A421, 
Bedford Road and Green Lane. There is a junction on Green Lane leading to an 
access track on land on the western side of Rookery North Pit which extends 
southwards into Rookery South Pit and the generating equipment site. The gas and 
electrical connections would either be primarily accessed from Junction 13 of the M1 
via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill 
Road or from Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
and Millbrook Road depending on their locations. There are overhead power lines 
that run west to east south of Rookery South Pit.  
 
Rookery South Pit which is approximately 95 ha is bounded by steep clay banks that 
are varied in nature and substrate. The pit base currently includes a range of wetland 
habitats, including open water, reed beds, pools and bare inundated clay with 
ephemeral water bodies. The land that remains at the original ground level, 
approximately 42 m above ordnance datum (AOD) around the periphery of The 
Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground that has been cleared of vegetation. 
 
The Rookery is currently the subject of an ongoing low level restoration scheme by

the landowner. Once restored, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 15 m below 
the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of part of the site proposed to 
accommodate the generating equipment and laydown area. 
 
BACKGROUND AND THE APPLICATION PROPOSAL 
The proposal development would consist of gas powered generation plant and 
underground connections to the national electricity and gas networks. It is stated that 
the plant will be capable of generating up to 299MW of electricity. This is equivalent 
of providing power to 150,000 household per year. 
 
The Power Generation Plant site and part of the gas and electrical connections would 
be situated on land within former clay pits designated as Rookery Clay Pits County 
Wildlife Site (CWS). Other parts of the gas and electrical connections would extend 
beyond the pits on to farmland to the either the south and/or east. As part of the 
scheme a stack is proposed that would be 35m high. This has been reduced from 
60m (originally proposed in 2014. 
 
The project is classified as a nationally significant project under the Planning Act 
2008.  
 
An initial phase of statutory consultation was undertaken during October/November 
2014 and informal consultation during June 2014. The project was put on hold in 
2015. A second phase of consultation is now being undertaken extending from May 
until early July. The applicant has stated that their intention is to submit an application 
for a Development Consent Order in the latter part of 2017.

SUMMARY OF REPLIES TO CONSULTATIONS/REPRESENTATIONS RECEIVED 
Wellingborough Borough Council is a consultee only on this application and, 
therefore, no consultations have been carried out on this application by the Borough. 
 
ASSESSMENT AND REASONED JUSTIFICATION 
The proposed development is a schedule 1 development as defined by the EIA 
Regulations. As a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under 
the EIA Regulations 2009, before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017 it 
means that in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 
37(2)(a)(ii) that the EIA 2009 regulations will apply. 
 
Although details of the preferred layout of the power generation plant have been 
identified the final location and layout are yet to be determined.  
 
 Another company was granted a Development Consent Order in 2011 for 
a separate project to be operated from part of the existing application site. The 
Delegated Report

existing permitted development is an energy resource recovery facility. This allows 
municipal, commercial and non-hazardous industrial waste residual waste, left after 
recycling and composting as fuel to generate 50MW of heat and electricity. This 
consent has been implemented. 
  
The applicant has stated that both companies are working closely together to enable 
both schemes to co-exist. At this stage no specific details as to how this would 
happen have been provided.  
  
The preliminary findings of the studies undertaken by the applicant indicate that the 
key impacts are transport, air quality, visual impact, effects on culture and heritage, 
local ecology. It is considered all the potential key impacts issues have been 
identified in order to guide the decision making process to finalise the design to and 
produce an Environmental Impact Assessment to accompany the application.  
 
Based on the general information provided relating to the design, layout and location 
of the development, it is not considered that the proposal would not give rise to any 
material planning considerations relevant to this council's administrative area. 
 
CONCLUSION 
It is concluded that no objections are raised at this second consultation stage. The 
applicant should be advised that Council will review this position once the scheme 
has been finalised and details of the findings of the completed Environmental Impact 
assessment are known.

lighting scheme associated with the 
operation of the Power Generation 
Plant has been sensitively designed to 
minimise potential impacts on bats. An

Public Health England 
The detailed quantitative and 
cumulative assessments have been

One comment states that the EIA should 
give consideration to best practice guidance 
such as the Government's Good Practice 
Guide for EIA 
Public Health England 
Section 2.6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) sets out the guidance 
used within the EIA including the 
Government's Good Practice Guide for

One comment states that the ES should 
clearly identify the development's location 
and the location and distance from the 
development of off-site human receptors that 
may be affected by emissions from, or 
activities at, the development. Off- site 
human receptors may include people living in 
residential premises; people working in 
commercial, and industrial premises and 
people using transport infrastructure (such 
as roads and 
railways), recreational areas, and publicly-
accessible land. Consideration should also 
be given to environmental receptors such as 
the surrounding land, watercourses, surface 
and groundwater, and drinking water

One comment states that whilst screening of 
impacts using qualitative methodologies is 
common practice where it is possible to 
undertake a quantitative assessment of 
impacts then this should be undertaken. 
Public Health England 
Quantitative assessments have been 
undertaken where possible as part of 
the EIA and are documented within the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1). These 
include Air Quality (Chapter 6), Noise 
(Chapter 7), Transport (Chapter 12) and 
Socio-Economic (Chapter 14). 
One comment states that the EIA should 
include consideration of the COMAH 
Regulations (Control of Major Accident 
Hazards) and the Major Accident Off-Site 
Emergency Plan (Management of Waste 
from Extractive Industries) (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2009: both in terms of 
their applicability to the installation itself, and 
the installation's potential to impact on, or be 
impacted by, any nearby installations 
themselves subject to these Regulations. 
Public Health England 
Neither the Project or other nearby 
developments constitute a COMAH or 
Major Accident Off-Site Emergency 
Plan Site and therefore this topic has 
not received further consideration.

BS4142:2014 has been published. The 
scope of this standard has now been clarified

site in this vicinity used by the sailing club 
which should be considered.

This location has been considered in 
Chapter 7 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) as stated in Table 7.1. 
One comment references that paragraph 
7.5.6 of the PEIR states that the operation of 
the gas above ground installation produces a 
'low hum'. Whilst it is appreciated that there 
is some distance to the nearest receptor this 
low frequency noise needs to be 
quantified/clarified.

noise impact from the Gas Connection 
during operation and maintenance will 
be neutral, not significant.

One comment is concerned over the 
inversion that can occur locally in Marston 
Vale 
Marston Moretaine 
Parish Council 
The proposed technology choice for the 
Generating Equipment (simple cycle 
gas turbines) result in a release of 
exhaust gases from the stack(s) which 
is at an extremely high temperature 
(around 450oC) and high pressure. This 
ensures that although the actual height 
of the stacks is 30-35m, the effective 
chimney height (top of the emissions 
release) is many times higher (of the 
order of hundreds of metres). 
Therefore, no issues with temperature 
inversions are anticipated as the 
exhaust gases would be able to 
penetrate any inversion layers. Chapter

One comment states that any assessment of 
impacts arising from emissions due to 
construction and decommissioning should 
consider potential impacts on all receptors

should be accounted for. 
Public Health England 
Emissions arising during the 
construction and decommissioning 
phases of the Project have been 
assessed within the Air Quality Chapter 
6 of the ES (Document Reference  6.1), 
Section 6.7 states that dust deposition 
and elevated PM10 concentrations are 
the main potential air quality effects 
during these periods. In addition, 
emissions of NOx can occur from road 
traffic and equipment used on site. 
Table 6.14 states the significance of air 
quality effects during construction and 
decommissioning to be not significant. 
One comment states that the project should 
follow best practice guidance during all 
phases from construction to 
decommissioning to ensure appropriate

Public Health England 
The ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
Section 6.5 states that in the case of 
combustion of natural gas in a power 
station, the main pollutants are NOx and 
Carbon Monoxide (CO).  There are 
objectives for both these pollutants; 
these are listed in Table 6.2. 
One comment states that consideration of 
aspects such as the deposition of chemicals 
emitted to air 
and their uptake via ingestion need to be 
considered. 
Public Health England 
Section 6.7 of the ES (Document

One comment states that the LVIA is not as 
comprehensive as required for a 
development of this nature. The Zone of 
Visual Influence has been limited to a 5km 
radius - whilst this area will experience the 
greatest change, the impact over 10km 
would highlight the communities which would 
be affected by the proposal. The ZVI

between the visibility of the vertical features 
and the built form of the plant and substation.

nature of the transmission towers. Although 
there is a line of pylons already (one of which 
would be removed) and the railway catenary, 
these structures are considered to be 
detracting features, particularly in the view 
from the Ridge.

Following consultation responses 
received MPL has taken the decision to 
pursue an underground electrical 
connection to mitigate the visual impact 
of transmission towers. 
One comment states that the cumulative 
impact of the development has not been fully 
examined e.g. the PEIR has not taken the 
visual impact of the wind turbine at the 
Millennium Country Park and the proposed 
turbine at Stewartby landfill site into

the Covanta landscape scheme. In the 
Montages - the Covanta EfW building acts as

development does not show strategic 
landscape planting on the Application Site. 
The "woodland" planting to the south is part 
of the Low Level Restoration Scheme, the 
land for which is currently being excavated. 
The proposed planting would need around 
15 years’ growth to achieve partial screening 
of the proposal. The rest of Rookery Pit 
appears "green" as if it was open space.

One comment states that Aviation Warning 
lighting only becomes legally mandated for 
structures of a height of 150m or more 
through Article 219 of the UK Air Navigation 
Order. However, structures of lesser height 
might need aviation obstruction lighting if 
they are considered a significant navigational 
hazard. 
Civil Aviation Authority 
The maximum proposed height within 
the Project design is a 35m stack 
measured from the base of the 15 m 
deep pit – considerably lower than, for 
example, the existing transmission 
towers in the area. Aviation obstruction 
lighting is not therefore deemed 
necessary.

One comment states that the civil aviation 
requirement in the UK is for all structures 
over 300ft (91.4m) high to be charted on 
aviation maps. As the structures in the 
project proposals are below this threshold 
there is no civil aviation charting requirement 
subject to Cranfield Airport requirements. 
However, if a temporary structure such as a 
crane exceeds this threshold then a Notice to 
airmen (NOTAM) must be arranged through

that will be affected. The PEIR 
acknowledges this (Tables 13.12 and 13.13) 
and says that the scope of the evaluation will 
be agreed with this Authority. This is 
satisfactory, but it is important to note that 
the information from the evaluation is 
required to inform the Environmental 
Statement and does not form part of the 
mitigation process as suggested by the 
Report (Tables 13.12 and 13.13). 
One comment states that Section 13.3 of the 
PEIR briefly discusses mitigation measures. 
It suggests that “standard mitigation 
measures include directing development 
away from known areas of buried 
archaeology and adherence to a CEMP to 
set out a process for notifying a local 
authority archaeologist of any archaeological 
remains is identified during the development. 
The avoidance of known archaeological 
remains is an important method for ensuring 
there are no damaging impacts on heritage 
assets with archaeological interest. This 
does rely on there being adequate 
information on the on archaeological remains 
before the development starts, hence the 
importance the pre-determination

One comment states that there is evidence 
that, in some cases, perception of risk may 
have a greater impact on health than the 
hazard itself. A 2009 report, jointly published 
by Liverpool John Moores University and the 
HPA, examined health risk perception and 
environmental problems using a number of 
case studies. As a point to consider, the 
report suggested: "Estimation of community 
anxiety and stress should be included as part 
of every risk or impact assessment of 
proposed plans that involve a potential 
environmental hazard. This is true even 
when the physical health risks may be 
negligible." PHE supports the inclusion of 
this information within EIAs as good 
practice.

The potential for likely significant effects 
of the Project on human health relate 
primarily to exposure to excessive 
levels of noise, pollutants released

One comment states that it is highly likely that the 
proposed new access roads off Green Lane in 
Stewartby and Station Lane in Millbrook will have 
an impact on the 2 Level Crossings located on 
both these roads. 
Network Rail 
Infrastructure Ltd 
MPL has liaised with Network Rail asset 
protection (Richard Draper - 
Birmingham) on this issue, who 
previously advised (2015) that they do 
not have any issues with the MPL 
Project. It was confirmed with Network 
Rail that their previous comments are still 
valid. 
Network Rail were issued a draft copy of 
the Transport Assessment (TA) (which 
includes traffic management measures 
for Green Lane) and invited to comment 
on it. Network Rail confirmed that they 
have no objections to the proposal. 
One comment states that in 2015 there was a 
proposal to re-model a section of Green Lane 
where the new access road would join it. 
Network Rail 
Infrastructure Ltd 
There would be a small amount of work 
required by either MPL or Covanta 
(under the RRF Order) to improve 
visibility splays at Green Lane. These are 
described in the TA (sent to Network Rail 
for comments) and Section 12.7 Chapter 
12 of the Environmental Statement (ES). 
One comment states that a traffic management 
control scheme must be included within the 
construction works phase to remove issues of 
blocking back along Green Lane and Station 
Lane. 
Network Rail 
Infrastructure Ltd 
These measures are outlined in the TA 
and have been agreed with Network Rail. 
Network Rail were consulted on a draft 
copy of the TA (which includes a traffic 
management control scheme) and have 
confirmed that they have no objections to 
the proposal. 
One comment states that impacts from the 
proposal at construction phase and operation 
phase on Network Rail’s level crossings should 
be considered within the Transport Assessment. 
Network Rail 
Infrastructure Ltd 
These measures have been addressed 
in the TA. Network Rail was issued a 
draft copy of the TA and have confirmed 
that they have no objections to the 
proposal. 
One comment states that any mitigation 
measures required at the Green Lane and 
Station Lane level crossings would need to be 
fully funded by the developer and agreed with 
Network Rail. 
Network Rail 
Infrastructure Ltd 
MPL acknowledge this comment and 
confirms that any mitigation measures 
required (as outlined in the TA) would be 
funded by the developer. 
One comment states that traffic flow within 
Buckinghamshire as a result of the proposals 
would not be considered a severe residual impact 
of the Millbrook Power development. 
Buckinghamshire 
County Council 
MPL agrees and considers that no 
further action is required to resolve this 
comment. 
Two comments state that the ES should include: 
Information on the needs of major road users and 
acknowledges the requirement to ensure that 
major road users are not disrupted through the 
development process; 
Information on the proposed construction traffic 
mitigation measures, including a draft 
Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP), 
CEMP and Contractor’s Route Management 
Plan. 
Royal Mail Group 
The TA considers the impact on major 
road users. A draft Construction Traffic 
Management Plan (CTMP) contained in 
Appendix 12.4 of the TA and draft 
Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) (Appendix 
3.2 of the ES) will be submitted with the 
DCO Application. 
One comment states that Royal Mail requests to 
be consulted by MPL on proposed road 
closures/diversions/ alternative access 
arrangements, hours of working and the content 
Royal Mail Group 
MPL will consult Royal Mail on the 
submitted DCO Application which will 
include details on any road closures / 
of the CEMP, CTMP and the Contractor’s Route 
Management Plan. 
diversions / alternative access / working 
hours and an outline CEMP and CTMP. 
One comment states that the greatest traffic 
impacts will occur in the construction and 
decommissioning periods. 
Bedford Borough 
Council 
MPL agree with this comment, impacts 
are assessed in section 12.7 Chapter 12 
of the ES. Appropriate mitigation for the 
construction and decommissioning 
phase impacts are set out in Section 
12.9 Chapter 12 of the ES. 
Four comments state that the TA should: 
Evidence that in the operational period there will 
be very little vehicle activity 
Consider access impacts by all modes, on 
existing and future traffic levels and Construction 
Management Plan (CPM) that uses information 
from this 
Consider the suitability of the vehicular access 
points and routes. The A507 (south) and B530 
(east) have both weight and width restrictions on 
them and will need to be assessed for their 
suitability for HGV or significant additional traffic. 
We would however not expect to see routing 
through the local villages.  
Bedford Borough 
Council 
Operational movements would be limited 
to a small number of full time staff 
(maximum of 4 at any one time) as well 
as infrequent maintenance visits (usually 
one person once a week). 
MPL confirms that the TA includes 
details on all the issues raised, including 
impacts by all transport modes. The TA 
sets out that vehicle routeing through 
local villages will be avoided altogether 
by HGVs and where possible by other 
traffic. Construction and operational 
access routes are outlined at Section 
12.6 Chapter 12 of the ES.  
One comment states that the CMP should 
include details of on-site wheel wash facilities 
required during the full construction phase to 
ensure the public highway remains clear of mud. 
Bedford Borough 
Council 
Principles for the use of a wheel wash 
facility are included in the outline CEMP 
(Appendix 3.2 of the ES). The exact 
position will be agreed prior to 
construction and detailed in the final 
CEMP. 
One comment states if the EfW [Covanta Project] 
is not implemented before the Project then a new 
access will need to be submitted as part of any 
DCO application. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
MPL acknowledge this comment and the 
matter is dealt with in Chapters 1 and 3 
of the ES. If the Covanta EfW Project is 
not implemented prior to the MPL 
project, MPL will construct the new 
Access Road. Two options for the 
Access Road are provided for through 
the MPL Draft Order (one complete 
access road from Green Lane to be built 
by MPL should it be constructed before 
Covanta, and the ‘Short Access Road’ to 
be built by MPL to connect the Covanta 
access road to the Generating 
Equipment Site should the Covanta EfW 
be constructed first), and are highlighted 
in the ES in Chapters 1, 3 and 12. Both 
scenarios, i.e. MPL being constructed 
first and Covanta being constructed first, 
have therefore been assessed within the 
ES. 
Three comments state that the following details 
should be provided to CBC: 
details on construction vehicles including 
abnormal loads 
full details of a construction traffic route which 
should not include routing from the A507 through 
Lidlington, Millbrook or Marston Moretaine. 
engineering layout of proposed Green Lane 
access for approval. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
This information is included in the TA 
(Appendix 12.3 of the ES) which outlines 
the construction and operational traffic 
routes, the number of abnormal loads 
and an engineering drawing showing the 
design of the Green Lane junction 
(Figure 12.1 of the ES). CBC were 
issued a draft copy of the TA for 
comment. 
One comment raised concern about the potential 
impact of creating permanent access off 
Houghton Lane. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
Section 12.7 Chapter 12 of the ES 
explains that only the existing access off 
Houghton Lane would be used on a 
permanent basis. The access would be 
improved and used for very infrequent 
maintenance visits to the AGI. It is not 
intended as a main access to the Project 
Site.  
One comment raised concern about the potential 
impact of regular access to the AGI site off an 
existing track access. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
Section 12.7, Chapter 12 of the ES 
explains that the access of Houghton 
Lane is existing and would be improved 
and only used very infrequently for 
maintenance visits to the AGI. It is not 
intended as a main access to the Project 
Site. 
One comment raised concern that the proposed 
access off Green Lane could risk traffic backing 
up and possibly onto the railway line at the Green 
Lane level crossing. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
MPL has liaised with Network Rail asset 
protection (Richard Draper - 
Birmingham) on this issue, who has 
advised that they do not have any issues 
with the MPL Project. 
Network Rail were issued a draft copy of 
the TA (which included traffic 
management measures for Green Lane). 
Network Rail have confirmed that they 
have no objections to the proposal. 
Landscape 
17 
Three comments stated that the next stage of the 
landscape and visual assessment should provide 
further information on: 
Chilterns Conservation 
Board 
The Landscape Visual Impact 
Assessment (LVIA) (Chapter 11 of the 
ES) includes commentary on the 
photomontages taken from several 
viewpoints which have been agreed with 
implications on the skyline view and 
reassurances that the skyline would not be 
‘broken’ by the proposed 35 metres stack; 
cumulative impact of the project would require 
commentary within the scope of the Infrastructure 
Planning (EIA) Regulations 2009; 
proposed landscaping to mitigate any visual 
impact in the wider view and the AONB. 
consultees (e.g. CBC). Section 11.9 
Chapter 11 of the ES contains a 
cumulative assessment of MPL and 
other committed developments, which 
has also been undertaken in accordance 
with the 2009 EIA Regulations and the 
GLVIA 3 guidance. 
Section 11.5 Chapter 11 of the ES 
explains that the Chilterns AONB has 
been scoped out of the assessment 
given the distance between it and the 
Project Site (approximately 12 km), 
intervening topography, and the size of 
the Project. The Zone of Theoretical 
Visibility (ZTV) plan produced for the 
LVIA (Figure 11.1 of the ES) shows that 
the Project will not be visible from the 
AONB. Further detail is provided in 
Section 11.5 Chapter 11 of the ES. 
One comment states that insufficient information 
has been provided to assess impact on the 
historic environment and that the only 
visualisations provided are presented in the 
Landscape and Visual Impact photomontages 
from 2014 and Insert 2 in the PEIR Non-
Technical Summary. 
Historic England 
The photomontages in the PEIR and 
presented in the DCO Application 
(Document Reference 7.1) were 
produced in 2017. 
A high resolution copy of the 
photomontages were sent to HE in 
August 2017 in both electronic and hard 
copy (on USB drive). 
The range of viewpoints used for the 
photomontages, together with on-site 
views where photographs have been 
taken for analysis (and not turned into 
photomontages) have been agreed with 
CBC and have been designed to cover 
both historic and non-historic assets. 
Two comments state that additional Landscape 
and Visual Impact assessment viewpoints would 
be valuable and necessary to understand visual 
impacts on: 
Houghton House; 
Marston Mortaine church tower; 
Ampthill Park House 
Historic England 
Viewpoint 4 (Figure 11.2 of the ES) 
provides a sufficient view to assess the 
effects on Houghton House. Marston 
Moretaine Church is outside of the ZTV 
therefore there is no scope for 
intervisibility and no effects on the church 
are anticipated. 
Chapter 11 of the ES contains a view 
from the eastern edge of Marston 
Moretaine adjacent to the church (VP 8 
presented in the photomontages 
(Document Reference 7.1) and shows 
that there is no intervisibility between the 
church and the Project Site. 
Chapter 11 of the ES recognises the 
view from Ampthill Park House which is 
assessed in Appendix 13.2 of the ES; 
Viewpoint 7 is taken from the Public 
Right of Way at the front of the house 
and is considered to provide a sufficient 
view for the assessment of effects on 
setting of the heritage asset. 
For the avoidance of doubt, 
photomontages constitute tools to 
illustrate an assessment of impact on 
heritage assets, they do not constitute 
the assessment itself. The assessor has 
been to site, considered the position from 
a number of locations and set out a full 
assessment in Appendix 13.2 of the ES. 
The photomontages are provided for 
context to the reader. 
One comment states that images and maps need 
to be of a high resolution to enable assessment 
of impact on setting of heritage assets. 
Historic England 
MPL consider that, if printed at the 
correct scale, the images are of a 
suitable resolution. However, a high-
resolution copy of the photomontages 
was sent to HE in August 2017 in both 
electronic and hard copy (on USB drive). 
One comment raises concern over the 
methodology used to assess designated heritage 
assets (i.e. viewpoints were viewed from the 
closest possible publicly accessible location) and 
states that efforts should be made to ensure that 
assets are properly assessed including securing 
private access to undertake the assessment if 
required. 
Historic England 
MPL considers that the LVIA assessment 
has been prepared in accordance with 
best practice guidance. Guidelines on 
undertaking photomontages as set out in 
GLVIA 3 state that they should be taken 
from publicly accessible locations. 
Taking views from publicly accessible 
locations did not lead to any limitations to 
the assessment of the designated assets 
or their setting, as a full assessment of 
the significance and setting of the assets 
(including how setting contributes to the 
significance of the assets) was possible 
on this basis (Appendix 13.2 of the ES). 
The approach taken is considered to 
have been sufficient for undertaking a 
robust assessment of the assets. 
One comment states that the heritage impact 
conclusions should consider the effects on 
significance of heritage assets (i.e. as opposed to 
the effects on the setting which makes a 
Historic England

the assessment presented in Appendix 
13.2 of the ES has been refined in order

asset). 
attributes of each asset and not on their 
grading alone. 
One comment states that it is not clear how the 
impact of the sealing end compounds has been 
considered and that the cumulative impact of the 
sealing end compounds and the stack should be 
considered. 
Historic England 
Section 13.10 Chapter 13 of the ES 
considers the effects of the Project taken 
as a whole (including the stack and the 
SECs together). 
One comment states that based on an initial 
assessment of the photomontages provided in 
PIER stage, it is considered that there is likely to 
be notable harm to the significance of Ampthill 
Park, Park House and Houghton House through 
a development within their setting. 
Historic England 
An assessment of these assets is 
provided in Appendix 13.2 of the ES. 
Based on our assessment which has 
included studying photomontages and 
visiting the assets, we do not consider 
that the Project would cause significant 
harm to the setting of these assets given 
the scale of the Project and intervening 
topography, vegetation and buildings, 
alongside modern features already in the 
landscape. 
One comment states that the cumulative impact 
of both projects (the Covanta RRF and MPL) on 
the significance of heritage assets, in particular 
Park House, Ampthill Park and Houghton House, 
is likely to be harmful. 
Historic England 
An assessment of potential cumulative 
effects on historic assets is provided in 
section 13.8 of Chapter 13 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1); and has 
been fully considered in Appendix 13.2 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.2). 
One comment states that there are no viewpoints 
from within Bedford Borough within the 
Landscape and Visual Impact assessment and 
two comments state that additional viewpoints 
should be included in the final submission: 
Green Lane/Kimberley College; 
Bedford Borough 
Council 
LVIA viewpoint 12 has been taken from 
the entrance to the Project Site and 
represents a worst case viewpoint from 
Green Lane / Stewartby. This 
assessment shows that the Power 
Rear of Stewartby 
Generation Plant is not easily seen given 
topography and intervening vegetation. 
The ZTV produced for the Project (Figure 
11.1 of the ES) also indicates that the 
project would not be visible from the 
majority of the rear of Stewartby. 
One comment states that the Project will require 
a full landscaping scheme and that a commitment 
to some off site planting would be beneficial to 
mitigate the impact on views from public right of 
way and the residential properties. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
An outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation and Management Strategy, 
describing mitigation planting proposals 
for the Project is provided in Appendix 
11.3 of the ES. The mitigation planting 
that has been proposed is contained 
within the Order Limits of the Project and 
is therefore does not constitute ‘off-site’ 
planting. It is not considered that any 
further planting is required outside of the 
Order Limits. 
One comment states that the Project site 
landscaping scheme should support the aims of 
The Forest Plan and meet the 30% tree canopy 
expectation. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
The planting proposed in the outline 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and 
Management Strategy provides for 30% 
coverage of the land that will be 
permanently developed by the Project. 
Three comments request that CBC are involved 
in the future development of the: 
colour palette; 
Landscape Management Plan; 
Ecology Management Plan. 
Central Bedfordshire 
Council 
An outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy, describing mitigation 
planting proposals for the Project is set 
out in Appendix 11.3 of the ES. A Design 
and Access Statements has also been 
submitted in support of the DCO 
Application (Document Reference 10.2) 
setting out the design principles of the 
Project. 
Requirement 3 of the draft DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1) states that 
the final Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation and Management Strategy will 
be agreed with CBC prior to 
commencement of construction. 
MPL confirms that any final decisions on 
the future development of the colour 
palette would be agreed with CBC prior 
to construction.

One comment states the site is located entirely 
within Flood Zone 1 (lowest probability of 
flooding) on our Flood Map. 
The Environment 
Agency 
The Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) 
(Document Reference 5.4) 
acknowledges this fact. MPL considers 
that no further action is required to 
resolve this comment.  
One comment states that the site is considered to 
be of moderate sensitivity and could present 
potential pollutant/contaminant linkages to 
controlled waters. 
The Environment 
Agency 
The potential impacts on controlled 
waters have been assessed in Section 
10.7 Chapter 10 of the ES. Measures set 
out in the CEMP (Appendix 3.2 of the 
ES), including undertaking a foundation 
works risk assessment prior to 
construction mean that any residual 
effects would be negligible. 
One comment states that depending on the 
outcome from the proposed works in the 
‘Generating Equipment Area’ we may require 
additional site investigation works to provide 
robust lines of evidence that the risks to 
controlled waters are low. 
The Environment 
Agency 
Additional site investigation works will be 
undertaken prior to construction, as 
advised in Chapter 10 of the ES. These 
are secured through Requirement 8 of 
the Draft DCO (Document Reference 
3.1).  
One comment states that a risk assessment will 
be required if the application includes infiltration 
SuDS. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL confirm that the Project proposals 
do not include infiltration methods for the 
disposal of surface water from the Power 
Generation Plant Site. Surface water 
runoff arising from the Project is to be 
routed to the balancing pond brought 
forward as part of the Rookery South Pit 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS). 
Surface water accumulating within the 
balancing pond will be pumped to the Mill 
Brook in accordance with an existing 
Consent to Discharge (Water). 
Soakaways may be utilised at the AGI 
and SECs. However, infiltration tests and 
risk assessments would be undertaken 
prior to construction to determine 
whether this is feasible. These works 
would be the responsibility of National 
Grid. 
Two comments regarding pollution prevention: 

Prior to being discharged into any
watercourse, surface water sewer or
soakaway system, all surface water drainage
from lorry parks and/or parking areas for fifty
car park spaces or more and hardstandings
should be passed through an oil interceptor
designed compatible with the site being
drained. Roof water shall not pass through
the interceptor.

Prior to being discharged into any
watercourse, surface water sewer or
soakaway system, all surface water drainage
from parking areas for less than fifty spaces
The Environment 
Agency 
The FRA (Document Reference 5.4) 
explains that that provision for the 
management of surface water run-off 
arising from the completed development 
are incorporated within the LLRS which 
is proposed to be implemented prior to 
the Millbrook Power Project. The CEMP 
will set out measures for the 
management / control of surface water 
run-off during construction. 
Drainage measures are described in 
more detail in the FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4) and pollution prevention 
measures during construction are set out 
and hardstandings should be passed through 
trapped gullies with an overall capacity 
compatible with the site being drained. 
in the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.2 of the 
ES).  
One comment states that the Lead Local Flood 
Authority (LLFA) and Internal Drainage Board 
(IDB) should be contacted for drainage advice. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL have consulted with both the LLFA 
and IDB on surface water drainage 
matters. PBA attended a meeting with 
representatives from both the LLFA and 
IDB organisations on 4th July 2017. 
Three comments regarding water resources: 

Advice should be sought from Anglian Water
to establish whether water will be supplied
using existing sources and under existing
abstraction license permissions.

The timing and cost of infrastructure
improvements will be a consideration. This
issue should be discussed with the water
company.

It is the responsibility of the applicant to
ensure that no local water features (including
streams, ponds, lakes, ditches or drains) are
detrimentally affected, including both licensed
and unlicensed abstractions.
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL is not proposing any abstraction for 
the Project. MPL can confirm that the 
timing and cost of infrastructure 
improvements would be discussed with 
Anglian Water as appropriate. Schedule 
10 Part 5 of the draft DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1) contains Protective 
Provisions for the protection of Anglian 
Water. MPL is liaising with Anglian Water 
regarding the Protective Provisions. 
Two comments state that there are concerns 
regarding: 

the attenuation pond;

the risk of flooding.
Houghton Conquest 
Parish Council 
A FRA (Document Reference 5.4) has 
been prepared as part of the DCO 
Application which fully explains the 
residual flood risk at the site and the role 
of the attenuation pond. The FRA 
anticipates no effects on either. 
One comment states that the proposal is 
acceptable on the basis that the pumped 
discharge rate for surface water from Rookery Pit 
into Millbrook Brook will remain unchanged. 
Bedford Group of 
Internal Drainage 
Boards 
MPL confirms that the pumping regime to 
Mill Brook will not be affected by the 
proposals and that the IDB has been 
consulted regarding surface water 
drainage matters. PBA attended a 
meeting with the IDB on 4th July 2017 to 
agree the design of the proposed 
drainage strategy (meeting notes 
contained at Appendix 4.O.ii of the CR).  
One comment states that protective provisions 
specifically for the benefit of Anglian Water 
should be included as part of the wording of the 
Draft DCO these being in addition to provisions 
for utility companies as set out in the model 
provisions for DCO applications. 
Anglian Water Services 
Limited 
Schedule 10 Part 5 of the draft DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1) contains 
Protective Provisions for the protection of 
Anglian Water. MPL is liaising with 
Anglian Water regarding the Protective 
Provisions. 
Three comments in relation to diversion of 
Anglian Water assets state that: 

if it is not possible to incorporate existing
water mains within the proposals there may
be a need to divert these asset(s);

Anglian Water has a duty to divert existing
mains where requested but this would be at
the applicant’s expense;

if a diversion(s) is required the Applicant
would need to make a formal application to
Anglian Water for this purpose.
Anglian Water Services 
Limited 
MPL confirm that diversion of any assets 
would be fully discussed with Anglian 
Water at the appropriate time. MPL do 
not currently anticipate the need to divert 
any assets owned by Anglian Water. 
One comment states that it is noted that water is 
not generally required for the project but Anglian 
Water would welcome further discussion on this 
Anglian Water Services 
Limited 
MPL confirm that further discussion 
would be held with Anglian Water as 
required. 
issue if a connection to the existing water supply 
network is required. 
One comment requests clarity on whether there 
are any foul flows which will discharge into the 
public sewerage network in Anglian Water’s 
ownership. 
Anglian Water Services 
Limited 
As stated in the FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4) it is highly unlikely that 
the Project would be connected to the 
mains sewer. Given the small number of 
on-site staff waste water is likely to be 
collected in a sceptic tank. However, 
should any main sewer connection be 
required, MPL confirm that this would be 
fully discussed with Anglian Water.

One comment states that HE have concerns over 
the PEIR method; the sensitivity matrix (table 4.1) 
categorises a heritage as medium sensitivity 
however, HE consider the assessed heritage 
sites to be of high sensitivity and table 13.2 
attributes a high sensitivity to various designated 
heritage assets. 
Historic England 
MPL acknowledges this comment and as 
a result the sensitivity matrix, Table 4.4 
in Chapter 4 of the ES, has been 
amended. The methodology outlined in 
Chapter 13 of the ES has been followed 
through. 
Four comments on the assessment of heritage 
assets state that: 
HE do not agree that the grading of a building 
reflects the contribution of setting to its 
significance (PEIR para. 13.5.4); 
there may be cases where the setting of grade II 
buildings may encompass a wide area and 
makes a contribution to their significance; 
the detailed assessment on heritage assets do 
not consider the potentially harmful cumulative 
effect of more industrial development in their 
setting (Appendix 13.2.); 
Historic England 
MPL acknowledges this comment and as 
a result, the assessment presented in 
Appendix 13.2 of the ES has been 
refined and it has now been made 
clearer that assessments are based on 
the specific factors and attributes of each 
asset and not on their grading alone. 
It has been made clear in Section 13.7 
Chapter 13 and Appendix 13.2 of the ES 
that effects on heritage assets are 
considered in terms of levels of harm in 
accordance with the NPPF.

considered to be reasonable and the 
views were sufficient for undertaking a

One comment states that the PEIR document 
notes the stack may be seen within the settings 
of designated heritage assets and consequently 
may have an effect on the contribution setting 
makes to significance (13.7.7) however the 
impact is summarised as no more than a slight 
adverse indirect effect and for the majority of 
assets there would be a neutral indirect effect. 
Historic England 
MPL acknowledges this comment and as 
a result, the wording and assessment 
has been reviewed and amended as 
necessary in Chapter 11 of the ES.

asset). 
based on the specific factors and 
attributes of each asset and not on their 
grading alone. 
One comment states that based on an initial 
assessment of the photomontages provided in 
PIER stage, it is considered that there is likely to 
be notable harm to the significance of Ampthill 
Park, Park House and Houghton House through 
a development within their setting. 
Historic England 
An assessment of these assets is 
provided in Appendix 13.2 of the ES. 
Based on our assessment which has 
included visiting the assets, we do not 
consider that the Project would cause 
significant harm to the setting of these 
assets given the scale of the Project and 
intervening topography, vegetation and 
buildings, alongside modern features 
already in the landscape. 
One comment states that the cumulative impact 
of both projects (RRF and MPL) on the 
significance of heritage assets, in particular Park 
House, Ampthill Park and Houghton House, is 
likely to be harmful.

included as an Appendix 13.1 of the ES. 
It uses the methods and principles 
described in Historic England (2015) The 
Setting of Heritage Assets Historic 
Environment Advice in Planning 3. 
One comment states that impacts on the setting 
of designated heritage assets should be dealt 
with in the Historic Environment chapter of the 
Environmental Statement on the basis that that 
the recent High Court decision (Steer v SSCLG, 
22 June 2017) ruled that the setting of a 
designated heritage asset is not purely a matter 
of visual impact. 
Central Bedfordshire

One comment seeks clarification over the 
different electrical connection options. 
Houghton Conquest 
Parish Council 
Section 3.4 of the ES explains that the 
design has been refined to only 1 
electrical connection option. MPL will 
consult Houghton Conquest Parish 
Council on the submitted DCO 
Application which will include the ES. 
One comment states that National Grid Electricity 
Transmission has a high voltage electricity 
transmission overhead line (ZA 400kV Overhead 
Transmission Line – Grendon to Sundon) which 
lies within the proposed order limits. 
National Grid Electricity 
Transmission plc 
MPL acknowledges this comment and 
this is the location where the proposed 
electrical connection will connect into the 
NETS via a sealing end compound as 
shown in Figure 3.1 of the ES. 
Five comments make recommendations 
regarding built development in proximity to 
National Grid assets: 

statutory electrical safety clearances must
be maintained at all times (distances are
set out in EN 43 – 8 Technical
Specification for “overhead line
clearances Issue 3, 2004);

proposed buildings must not be closer
than 5.3m to the lowest conductor;
National Grid Electricity 
Transmission plc 
MPL acknowledges these comments and 
confirms that all works will adhere to 
National Grid advice and best practice.  
National Grid would have responsibility 
for construction of much of the Electrical 
Connection, as described in the Grid 
Connection Statement (Document 
Reference 9.1), and discussions are 
ongoing with National Grid to determine 
exact construction methods. 

National Grid recommends that no
permanent structures are built directly
beneath overhead lines;

If changes in ground levels are proposed
either beneath or in close proximity to our
existing overhead lines, then this would
serve to reduce the safety clearances for
such overhead lines;

safe clearances for existing overhead
lines must be maintained in all
circumstances.
Schedule 10 Part 3 of the draft DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1) contains 
Protective Provisions for the protection of 
National Grid. MPL is liaising with 
National Grid regarding the Protective 
Provisions. 
One comment states that plant, machinery, 
equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not 
encroach within 5.3 metres of any of our high 
voltage conductors when those conductors are 
under their worse conditions of maximum “sag” 
and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum 
“sag” and “swing”).

One comment states that MPL should obtain 
drawings of National Grid assets using the 
contact details provided. 
National Grid Electricity 
Transmission plc 
MPL has obtained drawings of National 
Grid assets and is working closely with 
National Grid regarding the design of the 
Electrical Connection. 
One comment requests that if a landscaping 
scheme is proposed only slow and low growing 
species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath 
and adjacent to the existing overhead line to 
reduce the risk of growth to a height which 
compromises statutory safety clearances. 
National Grid Electricity

that any such proposals should be discussed and 
agreed with National Grid prior to any works 
taking place. 
National Grid Electricity 
Transmission plc 
Two comments in relation to National Grid cables 
state that: 
ground levels above National Grid cables must 
not be altered in any way because alterations to 
the depth of cables will subsequently alter the 
rating of the circuit and can compromise the 
reliability, efficiency and safety of our electricity 
network; 
if alteration to ground levels above National Grid 
cables is required then consultation must be 
undertaken with National Grid prior to any such 
changes being implemented.

Section 3.3 Chapter 3 of the ES explains 
that the design comprises only 1 
proposed gas connection option. MPL 
will consult Houghton Conquest Parish 
Council on the submitted DCO 
Application which will include the ES. 
One comment states that National Grid has three 
high pressure gas transmission pipelines located 
within the proposed order limits: 

FM09- Huntingdon- Steppingley;

FM26- Huntington- Steppingley;

FM07- Old Warden- Chalgrove.
National Grid Gas plc 
MPL acknowledges this comment and 
the Project would connect to FM09 via a 
new AGI as described in Section 3.5 
Chapter 3 of the ES. 
MPL confirms that FM16 would not be 
affected by the Project since the Gas 
Connection would cross FM07. 
Three comments recommend measures to 
protect the National Grid Gas pipeline: 

where existing roads cannot be used,
construction traffic should ONLY cross the
pipeline at previously agreed locations;

the pipeline shall be protected, at the
crossing points, by temporary rafts
constructed at ground level.

third party shall review ground conditions,
vehicle types and crossing frequencies to
determine the type and construction of the
raft required and the type of raft shall be
agreed with National Grid prior to
installation.

(Document Reference 3.1) contains 
Protective Provisions for the protection of 
National Grid Gas plc. MPL is liaising 
with National Grid Gas plc regarding the 
Protective Provisions. 
Three comments received regarding protective 
measures for the National Grid pipeline: 
National Grid Gas plc 

No protective measures including the
installation of concrete slab protection
shall be installed over or near to the
National Grid pipeline without the prior
permission of National Grid;

National Grid will need to agree the
material, the dimensions and method of
installation of the proposed protective
measure;

the method of installation shall be
confirmed through the submission of a
formal written method statement from the
contractor to National Grid.
Three comments received on cable crossing of a 
pipeline: 

Cables may cross the pipeline at
perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90
degrees and clearance must be at least
600mm above or below the pipeline;

Impact protection slab should be laid
between the cable and pipeline if cable
crossing is above the pipeline;

A National Grid representative shall
supervise any cable crossing of a
pipeline.
National Grid Gas plc 
Two comments received on service crossing of a 
pipeline: 

Where a new service is to cross over the
pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6
metres between the crown of the pipeline
National Grid Gas plc 
and underside of the service should be 
maintained; or 

If this cannot be achieved the service
shall cross below the pipeline with a
clearance distance of 0.6 metres.
One comment requests that the Environmental 
Statement or any other subsequent report 
considers the potential impact of the proposed 
scheme on National Grid’s existing assets. 
National Grid Gas plc 
Chapter 3 of the ES sets out construction 
methods and describes at a high level 
best practice construction methods for 
e.g. crossing pipelines.

One comment raises a concern over emissions to 
air from the stacks. 
Houghton Conquest 
Parish Council 
A full air quality impact assessment is set 
out in Chapter 6 of the ES. This has 
demonstrated that there would be no 
significant air quality effects from the 
Project.  
One comment states that [the ES] should include 
a full air quality assessment and include any 
proposed mitigation required to achieve 
standards in the relevant guidance. 
Bedford Borough 
Council 
A full air quality impact assessment is set 
out in Chapter 6 of the ES. This has 
demonstrated that there would be no 
significant air quality effects from the 
Project. 
One comment states that traffic related Air 
Quality impacts should also be considered in any 
Air Quality Assessment (using figures from the 
TA). 
Bedford Borough 
Council 
MPL confirm that traffic related air quality 
impacts have been considered in the air 
quality impact assessment in section 6.7, 
Chapter 6 of the ES. However, no likely 
significant effects are anticipated given 
the relatively small numbers of traffic 
movements during both construction and 
operation. 
One comment states that the Parish Council 
express deep concern regarding the potential 
increase of ground levels of Nitrogen Dioxide 
(NO2) caused by emissions from the stack and 
the subsequent detrimental impact that this would 
have upon environmental habitats, human life 
and wildlife (In reference to PEIR NTS para. 3.2.9 
and para. 3.2.11). 
Marston Moreteyne 
Parish Council 
A full air quality impact assessment is set 
out in Chapter 6 of the ES. This has 
demonstrated that there would be no 
significant air quality effects from the 
Project. Section 6.8.16 Chapter 6 of the 
ES finds that all predicted nitrogen 
deposition rates are insignificant when 
compared to the critical loads for the 
habitats under consideration.  
One comment requests clarification as to what 
level is a detrimental effect deemed significant in 
relation to Para. 3.2.11 which states that “it is 
concluded that there are expected to be no likely 
significant effects during operation ….”. 
Marston Moreteyne 
Parish Council 
MPL confirm that significance is defined 
in relation to national air quality strategy 
objectives and assessed in accordance 
with established guidance. This is further 
set out in Section 6.5 Chapter 6 of the 
ES. 
Two comments express concerns about the 
dispersion of Nitrous Oxide (NO2) gases: 

Nitrous Oxide (NO2) gases have the
potential to be delayed from being
dispersed to a specific height; and
therefore,
Marston Moreteyne 
Parish Council 
MPL confirm that the release of NO2 
gases will not be significantly affected by 
temperature inversions since gases will 
be released at a high temperature and at 
high momentum. This is further 
described in Section 6.7 Chapter 6 of the 
ES. 

this time delay has the effect that Nitrous
Oxide gases could fall to the ground with
detrimental effects.
One comment advises that an Air Quality 
assessment including assessment of the Projects 
impact on any relevant Air Quality Management 
Areas (AQMA) will be completed during a permit 
determination of the relevant air quality modelling 
files. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL confirm that the air dispersion 
modelling as presented in Chapter 6 of 
the ES has been undertaken taking into 
account permit modelling requirements, 
including the cumulative effects with the 
proposed Covanta Energy from Waste 
Plant.  
One comment advises that the operator clarifies 
the scope of any air quality modelling that will be 
completed for the DCO with the Combustion 
Lead for the Installations Team. 
The Environment

This was discussed with the EA in 2014 
and has subsequently been the subject 
of further discussions with the EA 
regarding permitting of the Project. 
Two comments state that the air quality modelling 
should take the following factors into account: 

BAT requirements on Energy Efficiency;

cumulative impacts from other relevant
emission sources such as the proposed
Energy from Waste plant.

and no likely significant effects are 
anticipated. 
One comment states that air quality impacts from 
the proposal will not impact upon King’s Wood 
and Glebe Meadows Site of Special Scientific 
Interest (SSSI) or Coopers Hill SSSI on the basis 
that screening has indicated that the process 
contribution (PC) for all pollutants at all sites will 
be <1% of the relevant critical level or load for the 
most sensitive habitat at each site.

MPL acknowledges this comment and 
confirm that monitoring information would 
feed into the Site Condition Report . 
One comment states that a Foundation Works 
Risk Assessment (FWRA) will need to be 
produced to determine the risks to the underlying 
aquifers from proposed possible piled 
foundations. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL confirms that the FWRA will be 
undertaken prior to construction as set 
out in the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.2 of 
the ES) and will be secured by a 
Requirement of the DCO. 
One comment states that Appendix 4 of report 
[Appendix H of the 2017 PEIR] should include 
borehole logs for all of the trial pits and boreholes 
which were installed during the site investigation 
works. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL confirms that intrusive site 
investigation will be secured through a 
requirement of the DCO and will be 
undertaken prior to construction. 
One comment states that the proposed Phase 2 
geo-environmental intrusive investigation in the 
‘Generating Equipment Area’ is welcomed in 
order to provide robust lines of evidence to 
discount anthropogenic activities being the 
source of the identified contamination based on 
the previous site uses. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL confirms that intrusive site 
investigation will be secured through a 
requirement of the DCO and will be 
undertaken prior to construction. 
One comment states that the EA require a 
suitable risk assessment of the Secondary A and 
Principal Aquifers beneath the site in order to 
provide a better understanding of the sensitivity. 
The Environment 
Agency 
MPL confirm that a Phase 1 Ground 
Condition Assessment has been 
submitted as part of the application 
(Appendix 10.1 of the ES), and contains 
a risk assessment of Secondary and 
Principal Aquifers. 
Three comments state that an agricultural land 
quality and soil resources survey of the site is 
necessary in order to: 

assess the significance of the impact of
the Gas and Electrical Connections -
particularly any areas of land that will not
be re-instated or are likely to suffer
permanent loss;

Identify whether best and most versatile
land is affected and if so to what extent;

Inform the methodology for soil handling
during the works.
One comment states that to safeguard soil 
resources as part of the overall sustainability 
of the development, it is important that the 
soil is able to retain as many of its many 
important functions and services (ecosystem 
Natural England 
As acknowledged by Natural England, 
the majority of the Project is sited within 
brownfield land (Power Generation Plant, 
Substation, Laydown Area and Access 
Road). The Gas Pipeline part of the Gas 
Connection and the underground cable 
element of the Electrical Connection 
would both be buried in agricultural land. 
However, careful construction techniques 
such as topsoil stripping and storage, 
together with correct re-instatement 
would ensure that no agricultural land is 
sterilised. MPL therefore agrees with 
Natural England, that there would be no 
impact from these elements of the 
Project on agricultural land or soil 
resources. 
The remaining elements of the Project 
sited on agricultural land include the Gas 
services) as possible through careful soil 
management. 
Connection AGI (approximately 0.5ha) 
and the Electrical Connection Sealing 
End Compounds (SECs) (0.34ha). 
Although these elements are sited on 
agricultural land, it is Grade 3 according 
to the Agricultural Land Classification 
and therefore not the best quality or most 
fertile land (Grades 1 and 2).  Although 
the areas have not been assessed as 
part of the post 1998 agricultural land 
assessment, land immediately to the 
east of the Access Road has, which 
further classifies this land as Grade 3b – 
“Land capable of producing moderate 
yields of a narrow range of crops, 
principally cereals and grass or lower 
yields of a wider range of crops or high 
yields of grass which can be grazed or 
harvested over most of the year”. 
Additionally, the area required for the 
SECs has already been taken out of 
agricultural tenancy and is no longer 
farmed. Finally, any effects on 
agricultural land would be temporary, for 
a period of 25 years, upon which the 
Project would be decommissioned and 
land used for the SECs and AGI re-
instated to its former use. 
A Construction Environmental 
Management Plan (CEMP) would be 
produced prior to construction on site, 
along with method statements for 
construction of the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection. These documents 
would advise on the most appropriate 
working methods to protect agricultural 
land and soil quality. An outline of the 
CEMP is included at Appendix 3.2 of the 
ES. 
Taking all of the above into 
consideration, it is not anticipated that 
there would be a significant impact on 
soil resources or agricultural land as a 
result of the Project and therefore any 
further assessment has been scoped 
out.

Site Selection 
15 
Ten comments received oppose 
the Site selection. Reasons include 
that the area is already blighted 
with landfill sites and the proposed 
energy from waste plant. The Site 
should be re-instated to green 
space as it has not been a ‘brown 
field site’ for many years. Another 
comment suggests that the Site 
should be used for housing 
instead. Two respondents state 
that the Site should not be 
adjacent to the Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park. Also 
further reasons for the Site 
selection over an urban area are 
requested, such as why not SW3? 
The Site is a former clay extraction 
Site and in the process of low level 
restoration however the area is 
allocated within the Development 
Plan for major infrastructure 
development and therefore the 
intention is not that it should be 
returned to green field.  
MPL has undertaken an extensive 
Site selection process prior to 
selecting Rookery South Pit. This 
process identified that the Rookery 
Site had the following key 
advantages: 
� Close proximity to the national 
gas and electricity distribution 
networks; 
� Within an area identified as 
being potentially suitable for 
energy infrastructure; 
� The Generating Equipment 
Site is within previously 
developed land, lying below 
ground level;

One comment states that more 
meaningful statements are 
required about operation, instead 
of quoting 1,500 hours per year. 
This comment is acknowledged. 
As explained in Chapter 1 of the 
ES, as a peaking plant the Project 
would operate for up to 2,250 
hours per year, providing the five 
year rolling average does not 
exceed 1,500 hours. Peaking 
plants are required to operate 
when there is a ‘stress event’ on 
the National Grid. This occurs 
when there is a surge in demand 
for electricity associated with a 
particular event (e.g. where many 
people across the country boil 
kettles following the end of a 
popular television programme) or 
where there is a sudden drop in 
power being generated from plants 
which are constantly operational 
(e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking 
plants also help to ‘balance out’ 
the grid at other times of peak 
electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when 
other technologies (e.g. renewable 
energy sources, such as wind and 
solar farms) cannot generate 
electricity due to their intermittent 
operation and reliance on weather 
conditions.

Removing the pipeline would likely 
cause more harm to the

Developer contribution towards 
creating the Forest of Marston 
Vale: The Trust’s consistent 
approach to development within 
the designated Forest area is 
based on the fundamental issue of 
land availability for tree planting, 
applying a simple arithmetic 
approach to achieving the target of 
30% woodland cover by 2031. To 
achieve this, given that trees can 
only be planted on 77% of the 
Marston Vale (the remaining 23% 
is already built on or is open 
water), each development is 
expected to deliver its pro rata 
share based on 39% of the gross 
development area being planted 
as woodland, or an area equivalent 
to 39% of the development Site

establishment of an area of 
community woodland equivalent to

the Trust. 
See above. 
The decision as to which of these 
mechanisms used is largely with

is normally that the developer 
provides the required area of

financial contribution then MPL 
have used a community woodland 
creation model to calculate the 
cost of woodland delivery which 
generates the capital cost of 
planting and establishing 
community woodland over 25 
years. The budget model was built 
using over 10 years of community 
woodland creation experience and 
expertise; it has been successfully 
benchmarked against models used 
by the Forestry Commission and 
endorsed by them, and 
subsequently accepted by the 
Department for Communities & 
Local Government 
Over the last decade and more, 
the Trust has established a sizable 
body of precedent regarding 
developer contributions towards 
creation of the Forest. MPLare 
keen to understand how the 
proposed Millbrook Power 
development will contribute to the 
creation of the Forest in a way

In the last few days I have heard 
about the proposals for a new gas-
fired power station to be built in 
Stewartby. I would like to be 
considered for a Mechanical 
Maintenance role in the build and 
operation of the power plant as I 
feel I would be a good future 
addition to the plants workforce. I 
am extremely interested in this role 
as I am desperate to get back into 
working in the power industry due 
to my previous experience at Little 
Barford Power Station, St Neots. I

Three comments state that the 
Project will have a detrimental 
effect to property prices in the area 
and that more information is 
needed about this impact. 
There is no proven link between 
power station development and a 
decline in property prices. The 
location is considered suitable as 
visual impacts can be minimised 
by siting the majority of the Project 
in the Rookery pit and therefore 
below ground level. 
Photomontages produced show 
that the Project will not be visible 
from the majority of residential 
areas surrounding the Project Site. 
MPL notes that the local 
development plan states that the 
Site is allocated for development. 
One question asks how many jobs 
will the Project create and will they 
be for local people? 
Job numbers are given in Chapter

Appreciated the use of a brown

a negative effect to the visual 
impact of the area, including the 
walks, view, air quality, noise and 
sheer scale of the development. 
A full EIA has been undertaken in 
respect of the Project. See the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) that 
has been submitted with the 
application. 
The noise assessment is 
contained within Section 7 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
The noise assessment is

Two comments refer to the “Sound 
Bound” for South Pillinge Farm 
It is assumed that this refers to a 
sound/noise bund which is the 
general term for an embankment 
normally constructed to shield a 
development sometimes from sight 
or for noise purposes. MPL are 
aware that there is a temporary 
bund for sound purposes as part of 
the LLRS. The noise assessment 
at Chapter 7 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) indicates that a 
bund is not required to ensure 
there are no likely significant 
effects at the nearest noise 
sensitive receptors and would 
provide limited benefits.  
One comment favours the use of 
one or two Industrial Gas Turbines 
over three to five Aero-derivative 
Turbines as the Industrial Gas 
Turbines will be quieter. A further 
question asks what the estimated 
noise levels are when the plant is 
in operation? Stating that 
background noise levels mean that 
BS 4142 is not really suitable. 
It has been confirmed that the 
Power Generation Plant comprises 
one 
Gas 
Turbine 
Generator. 
Therefore, the worst case scenario 
(in terms of noise) of a single Gas 
Turbine 
Generator 
has 
been 
assessed in the ES. The use of 
industrial units is only likely to make 
a very marginal difference in 
operational noise.

undertaken in Chapter 7 of the ES

BS4142:2014 has been used to 
inform the assessment. This was 
the agreed approach with the 
Environmental Health Officer at 
CBC. 
A sound power noise level of 106 
dB has been assumed coming 
from the stack, sound pressure 
levels at 1 m from the Generating 
Equipment of 75 dB and sound 
pressure levels at 1 m from the Fin 
Fan Coolers of 85 dB. 
One comment states “Noise close 
to my house 150m away...”  
The noise assessment at Chapter

is not required to ensure that there 
are no likely significant effects at 
the nearest noise sensitive

One comment states that 
Meteorological data is being used 
from Cranfield. Cardington might 
be a better source of data – 
Cranfield is situated on the Ridge, 
whereas Cardington is in the 
Marston Vale, and close to the 
application Site.

projects. See Chapter 6 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). 
Five comments state that 
insufficient detail on air quality 
impacts has been provided, with 
further queries stating: 
� Where will NOx plumes fall 
out? 
� Why are emissions degraded? 
� What is the chimney output? 
� What is the air quality impact in 
the future? 
� Local health issues (chest 
complaints) have reduced 
since the brick works closed 
� Cumulative impact from the 
development on top of 
current grit and brick dust 
from decaying buildings 
The emissions from the stack 
have been fully modelled and 
assessed based on a worst case 
scenario of a single Gas Turbine 
Generator unit. This has set an 
appropriate stack height so as not 
to impact on sensitive receptors 
and to be within legislative limits 
for air quality. 
Diffusion diagrams showing NOx 
emissions have been produced in 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
The stack output is listed in 
Chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). 
Legislative limits are set so there 
will be no impacts on human 
health from emissions.

rise to significant levels of dust 
during construction or operation. 
One comment refers to the 
presence of a thermal inversion in 
the valley and how has the stack 
and air quality assessment taken 
this into account. 
The proposed technology choice 
for the Generating Equipment 
(open cycle gas turbine) results in 
a release of exhaust gases from 
the stack which is at an extremely 
high temperature (around 550oC) 
and high pressure. This ensures 
that although the actual height of 
the stack will be at least 32.5m, the 
effective chimney height (top of the 
emissions release) is many times 
higher (of the order of hundreds of 
metres). Therefore, no issues with 
temperature inversions are 
anticipated as the exhaust gases 
would be able to penetrate any 
inversion layers. 
One comment states that CO2 
mitigation should be installed to 
minimise emissions. 
As the Project is below 300MW 
generating capacity, it falls outside 
of the legislative requirements to fit 
CO2 capture. There are therefore 
no plans to develop CO2 capture 
or storage alongside the plant as 
described in Chapter 3 of the ES. .

Seven comments are concerned 
about the visual impact of the 
proposed Project from the views 
from Capability Brown’s Grade II 
listed park, Ampthill Park that 
recently has received £600k of 
lottery funding.  
Photographs have been taken and 
photomontages produced from the 
park showing how the Project will 
be viewed from that location. 
Although the Project will be able to 
be seen from the location it is not 
considered that these views will be 
subject to significant detrimental 
effects.  
Six comments are concerned 
about the visual impact of the 
proposed pylons. Stating the

of the Project have been assessed 
by undertaking field visits and 
producing photomontages of the

be a single stack of between 
32.5m and 35m in height. The 
plant will be sited in the Rookery 
pit, which will have a finished 
ground level of approximately

landscape effects would be either 
minor significant or not significant. 
The visual splay has been 
calculated on this limited basis, 
and the location of viewpoints is 
dependent upon this.  Therefore, I 
would wish to see evidence of the 
visual impact being thoroughly 
analysed throughout the year. 
Section 11 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) sets out the full 
methodology for the Landscape 
and Visual Impact Assessment.  
The visual splay, and therefore all 
else that is dependent upon it, 
does not state whether it relates to 
the visual impact of the main 
compound, chimneys or power 
transmission pylons.  This must be 
clarified, and if any element has 
not been taken into consideration, 
it must be. 
Where possible MPL has sought to 
limit visual impacts by e.g. 
reducing the stack heights and 
numbers as much as possible and 
siting the generating equipment

viewpoints already assessed were 
representative and sufficient. 
The Vale landscape to the north of 
the Ridge is recognised as crucial 
to the setting of the Greensand 
Ridge, as it emphasises the 
dramatic change in gradient which 
characterises the northern scarp 
slope of the Ridge – the open, 
level ground of the Vale is a foil to 
the steeply rising escarpment with 
it’s mosaic of woodland, pasture 
and arable land 
MPL notes this comment. 
The Landscape Character 
Assessment (LUC 2007/ revised 
2014) describes this relationship 
as a key visual sensitivity: “the 
largely undeveloped base of the 
wooded slope where the contrast 
between the wooded landform and 
the open vale is an important 
element”. 
MPL notes this comment. 
The landscape of the Vale has 
become highly fragmented as a 
result of the presence of transport 
corridors and the increase in 
development.  Development 
guidelines seek to enhance the rail

development of land at the base of 
the Mid Greensand Ridge in order 
to conserve the distinct visual 
contrast between the flat vale and

In addition, development is 
required to contribute positively to 
landscape character through 
associated planting and also to 
enhance the rights of way network. 
A Landscape and Ecology

designed landscape, which 
includes opening up and 
interpreting vistas.  The view from 
the escarpment across the Vale is 
a particularly important one, and 
the visual clutter potentially 
created by this proposal would 
significantly impact these views.   
The impact of night-time lighting 
also needs to be clarified and 
assessed.  
MPL Notes this comment. 
While opportunities for mitigation 
of the visual impact are limited due 
to the scale of features such as 
pylons and chimneys, the 
landscaping proposed is limited 
and feeble in terms of what should 
be achieved.  This is exacerbated 
by the fact that the proposal has to 
take account of the (doomed) 
Covanta proposal which it is still 
necessary to consider possible.  
Much better landscaping would be 
possible if the development 
footprint could be located in a 
different part of the Site.  Tree 
planting should be more 
natural/less regimented in 
structure than is currently 
indicated.  Any building structures 
should have external faces treated

with a fading effect similar to that 
of other warehouses in the 
Marston Vale, to help them blend 
in a little more to their

The visual impact of the main 
compound is significantly 
exacerbated by the impact of 
power transmission pylons.  The 
Marston Vale is a landscape in 
transmission, and is a significant 
recreational resource as well as a 
prime location for people to live 
and work.  Therefore, significant 
additional visual clutter should not 
be permitted

connection will be undergrounded,

Energy Policy EN1 seeks 
infrastructure developments to 
minimise harm to the landscape 
and to provide reasonable 
mitigation.  Designing the grid 
connection to be underground from 
the outset would be the most 
effective means of reducing the 
visual impact of the plant in views 
from nationally important heritage 
features such as Ampthill Park and 
Ampthill Park House as well as 
from the extensive rights of way 
network.

Appreciated the use of a brown 
field site, however, there would be 
a negative effect to the visual 
impact of the area. 
Where possible MPL has sought to 
limit visual impacts by e.g. 
reducing the stack heights and 
numbers as much as possible and 
siting the generating equipment 
within Rookery pit.  
MPL can confirm that the electrical 
connection will be undergrounded, 
resulting in no additional pylons in 
the landscape. 
The PIER landscape description 
needs to make it clear that the 
Marston Vale is surrounded by 
higher ground that forms an 
amphitheatre around the vale, and 
affords wide reaching and 
panoramic views. The impact of 
the Project on the Greensand 
Ridge, which is a high value 
landscape needs to be carefully 
considered. 
MPL notes this comment. 
The visual impact of the additional 
6 electricity pylons needs to be 
carefully assessed and 
considered. These cannot be 
dismissed just because they are 
pylons, and not solid structures

They represent additional tall

The visual impact of the additional 
chimneys and pylons will be 
considerable, especially when 
viewed from above, i.e. from 
Ampthill Park. Impact should not 
be dismissed as ‘not significant’. 
Impact of chimney stacks and 
pylons needs to be accurately 
assessed, particularly cumulatively 
with the other tall structures in the 
Vale. 
Where possible MPL has sought to 
limit visual impacts by e.g. 
reducing the stack heights and

Need for Project

Seven comments do not support 
non-renewable power generation 
and would rather see a renewable 
power Project being proposed. 
One comment suggests that there 
must already be sufficient back up. 
Four comments approve of the 
Project. Statements include that it 
is cleaner than coal, would help 
with the future needs of electricity 
and help with the energy crisis. 
The need for new energy 
infrastructure, and fossil fuel 
infrastructure, is established in 
various UK Government policy and 
guidance, including NPS EN-1 and 
NPS EN-2. 
The need for the Project is also 
discussed in Chapter 1 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). 
There is acknowledgement within 
Government policy and industry 
that established renewable 
technologies cannot provide the 
security of supply that consumers 
require. Further details are 
provided in the Planning Statement

that they hope will not be removed. 
MPL would like to keep the 
removal of trees to the minimum 
necessary in order to construct,

decommission the Project. 
Discussions have been held with 
various stakeholders, including 
CBC and the Forest of Marston

Given the proposed location is 
very close to existing wetlands of 
high ecological value, including 
resident and migrant bird 
populations, there is a further need 
to prevent new power lines 
causing problems for birds.  Clear 
approaches to waterbodies are 
required for many species, 
including waders, ducks and 
geese.  There is no evidence that 
the mapping of migration routes 
has been carried out and taken 
into account. 
MPL can confirm that the electrical 
connection will be undergrounded, 
resulting in no additional pylons in

It was considered that there were a 
lot of archaeological and ecological 
matters which outweighed the 
overall purpose. In addition, as 
Covanta could still come on board 
there were concerns as both things 
would not be needed in one area.  
It was also considered that the 
existence of the power station 
might be used to justify further 
wind turbine installations. 
MPL isn’t responsible for and can’t 
control other developments. Any

One comment states that the 
proposed electrical connection 
would carry high voltage should an 
accident occur. 
High voltage lines are located 
throughout the UK. They are 
owned and operated by National 
Grid. 
One comment states the need for 
a local call procedure in case of 
emergencies. 
MPL notes this comment. An 
outline CEMP, (Document 
Reference 6.2, Appendix 3.2) 
outlines procedures to follow in the 
event of an emergency during 
construction. 
During operation, any deviation 
from normal operating conditions 
(e.g. emission limits above those 
set by an operating permit) would 
be alarmed and deal with 
immediately. In extreme cases, the 
Generating Equipment would be 
shut down if it was not operating 
correctly, until the issue was 
rectified.

During consultation MPL has opted 
to move the AGI location to a 
preferred location of the landowner 
to reduce the impact on 
agricultural operations.  
Cultural Heritage and 
Archaeology

It was considered that there were a 
lot of archaeological and ecological 
matters which outweighed the 
overall purpose. In addition, as 
Covanta could still come on board 
there were concerns as both things 
would not be needed in one area. 
It was also considered that the 
existence of the power station 
might be used to justify further 
wind turbines installations. 
MPL isn’t responsible for and can’t 
control other developments. Any 
new project would require its own 
consent which would also likely be 
subject to public consultation 
(depending on the type of consent 
required). The area surrounding 
the proposal is allocated within the 
Development Plan for 
development. 
In the case of Houghton House 
and Ampthill Castle the setting of 
the heritage asset within the wider 
Vale was critical. These 2 heritage 
assets have a very strong 
interaction with the surrounding 
countryside, and should be 
assessed accordingly. Ampthill 
The impact on heritage assets has 
been considered in Chapter 13 of

Air quality 
19 
Six comments express concerns that the 
estimated impacts on air quality will have 
adverse effects on human health.    
MPL acknowledge these comments and a full 
air quality impact assessment has been 
undertaken and is presented in Chapter 6 of 
the ES which demonstrates that the Project 
will not cause significant air quality effects on 
human health. 
Four comments express concerns that the 
Project will have an adverse impact on air 
quality. 
One comment questions what prevailing 
wind direction has been assumed in the air 
quality assessment. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. The air 
quality assessment presented in Chapter 6 of 
the ES has taken into consideration 5-years’ 
worth of local meteorological data, collected at 
the closest weather station to the Project Site 
(Cranfield) and an analysis of this data has 
shown that the predominant prevailing wind is 
from the south west.   
Two comments express concern that stack 
emissions may have an adverse effect on 
Ampthill.  
MPL acknowledges these comments and a full 
air quality impact assessment has been 
undertaken (Chapter 6 of the ES) and has 
demonstrated no significant air quality effects 
from the plant on human health including 
residents in Ampthill.  
Two comments were received regarding 
air quality standards:  
•
Can the site meet air quality
standards with 2 projects proposed
to be constructed?
MPL acknowledges these comments and a full 
air quality impact assessment has been 
undertaken and is presented in Chapter 6 of 
the ES. This includes a cumulative 
assessment of the Project operating alongside 
Covanta. This assessment has demonstrated 
•
The project would breach
government guidelines on carbon
emissions after 2020 so the Project
will have a non-existent shelf life.
that no significant cumulative air quality effects 
are predicted.   
MPL can confirm that the Project will be 
designed to meet all relevant emissions 
targets (including C02).  
Four comments were received regarding 
the air quality impact assessment method: 
•
Three comments state the method
should take account of the fact that
in the past, pollution from the
brickworks affected air quality in
Ampthill;
•
One comment stated that baseline
data provided by Covanta is not
considered to be accurate.
MPL acknowledges these comments and a full 
air quality impact assessment has been 
undertaken and is presented in Chapter 6 of 
the ES. This has demonstrated no significant 
air quality effects from the plant on human 
health. The emissions from the Power 
Generation Plant will be of a significantly 
different type compared to emissions from 
Covanta and so the same issues will not be 
experienced.  
MPL cannot comment on the accuracy or 
otherwise of the baseline data used by 
Covanta.  
Transport 
28 
Eight comments state that additional traffic 
generated by the Project during the 
construction and operational phases will 
have an adverse impact on the local 
highway network. 
MPL acknowledges these comments and a full 
traffic and transport assessment has been 
undertaken and is presented in Chapter 12 of 
the ES as well as the Transport Assessment 
(Appendix 12.1 of the ES). These 
assessments fully describe impacts on the 
local road network both from the Project in 
isolation and cumulatively with other 
developments and both during operation and 
construction of the Project. The assessment 
has not shown any likely significant adverse 
effects. 
Six comments were received regarding 
cumulative transport impacts: 
•
2 comments state that local
infrastructure will not be able to
cope with the cumulative demand
from recent new developments in
the local area and the Project.
•
The Wootton Fields Development,
the Covanta Incinerator and the
Project will have cumulative
transport impacts;
•
Avoid construction works and traffic
on different developments being
carried out in parallel;
•
The Project will add to traffic
generated by Covanta;
•
Minimise the number of vehicle
movements.
MPL acknowledges these comments and a full 
traffic and transport assessment has been 
undertaken and is provided in Chapter 12 of 
the ES as well as the Transport Assessment 
(Appendix 12.1 of the ES). These 
assessments fully describe impacts on the 
local road network both from the Project in 
isolation and cumulatively with other 
developments including Covanta. The 
assessment has not shown any likely 
significant adverse effects. 
Measures to minimise the number of vehicle 
movements are set out in the TA which include 
car sharing. 
A cumulative assessment of potential traffic 
impacts between the Project and other 
relevant committed developments, including 
the Covanta RRF Project, is provided in 
Chapter 12 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1). 
One comment states it is nice to find that it 
[the Project] will only be operational at 
peak times.

Three comments state that the local road 
network is already very busy. 
MPL acknowledges these comments and a full 
traffic and transport assessment has been 
undertaken and is provided in Chapter 12 of 
the ES as well as a Transport Assessment 
(Appendix 12.1 of the ES). These 
assessments fully describe impacts on the 
local road network both from the Project in 
isolation and cumulatively with other 
developments. The assessment has not 
shown any likely significant adverse effects. 
Traffic surveys were carried out on the local 
road network near to the Project Site in both 
2014 and 2017. 
Measures to minimise the number of vehicle 
movements are set out in the Transport 
Assessment, which include car sharing. 
Four comments state that air pollution 
caused by an increase number of vehicles 
on the road is a concern. 
MPL acknowledges these comments. The air 
quality assessment contained in Chapter 6 of 
the ES has assessed traffic movements and 
given the relatively small number of 
movements and short construction period, no 
likely significant effects are anticipated. 
Four comments were received regarding 
the routing of construction traffic: 
•
One comment requests that the
Project should avoid lorry runs.
•
Two comments state construction
traffic should be routed along the
new A421 at J13 of the M1 as
opposed to the old A421;
•
One comment states that the
A421/A428 Marsh Leys
interchange is better suited to
accommodate HGV’s than the
A421/Marston Moretaine
interchange.
MPL acknowledges these comments. The 
proposed construction and access routes have 
been developed in discussion with relevant 
consultees (including Highways England) and 
represent the most appropriate and suitable 
methods of getting to the Project site whilst 
minimising impact on the local road network 
and local villages. 
One comment states that Preliminary 
Environmental Report tables 12.7 & 12.8 
are not clear - are the figures shown daily

One comment states that the PEIR does 
not recognise that there is a cycleway 
running along the c94 south of Green 
Lane. 
MPL acknowledges this comment and this has 
been checked and updated as appropriate in 
the ES. 
Site selection 
19 
Fourteen comments received oppose the 
site selection, reasons include:   
•
Five comments state that there is
already too much new development
in the local area, including new
homes and the Covanta Project;
•
One comment states the site is not
appropriate for a station of this
size;
•
Six comments state that the Project
should not be located in proximity
to existing homes, communities
and towns;
•
One comment states the Project
should be located along the
coastline;
•
One comment states the Vale of
Marston topography creates a bowl
effect which exacerbates harmful
effects.
MPL acknowledges these comments. The 
reasons for the choice of Project site are 
clearly set out in Chapter 5 of the 2017 PEIR 
and the Chapter 5 of the ES. The site has 
been chosen following a lengthy and extensive 
search by the project team and the suitability 
of the site is a combination of: 
•
Proximity to gas and electrical
connections;
•
Brownfield land;
•
Within a pit, so limiting visual effects; and
•
Allocated for development by CBC in their
local plan.
The air quality assessment (Chapter 6 of the 
ES) has not predicted any likely significant 
effects from emissions despite the Power 
Generation Plant being located in a ‘bowl’. 
One comment states that there must be 
more suitable sites for the Project.  
Three comments state that MPL should 
consider other sites for the Project. 
One comment states that it would be 
preferable for no development to take 
place on the site at all.  
Noise 
10 
Six comments state that noise impacts are 
a concern. 
MPL acknowledges these comments. A full 
noise assessment has been undertaken and is 
provided in Chapter 7 of the ES. Following 
publication of the 2017 PEIR, MPL 
investigated potential available mitigation 
methods to limit noise effects. By using 
different plant items with better acoustic 
characteristics, no likely significant effects 
from noise are anticipated during construction 
or operation of the Project. 
One comment states that local residents 
should be provided with further information 
on noise impacts. 
One comment states that the local area 
already suffers from noise issues. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. The noise 
assessment presented in Chapter 7 of the ES 
takes into consideration the existing baseline 
conditions, as well as cumulative effects with 
other planned developments in the area. No 
likely significant effects from noise are 
anticipated during construction or operation of 
the Project. 
Two comments received on the noise 
mitigation measures: 
•
the information just states that
mitigation measures will be
required but the anticipated noise
level at your closest receptor is not
defined;
•
noise limits should be agreed.
MPL acknowledges these comments and 
confirm that noise limits would be agreed as 
part of the Requirements attached to the DCO, 
which would bind the developer to meet 
certain noise criteria at specific locations. 
Ecology 
13 
Ten comments expressed concern over 
the potential impacts on wildlife, natural 
habitats and the environment generally. 
MPL acknowledges these comments. A 
detailed ecological assessment of the Project 
Site and surrounding area has been 
undertaken which included a phase 1 desk 
study and site walkover, followed by phase 2 
protected species surveys. The resulting 
analysis presented in Chapter 8 of the ES has 
revealed that the Project would not give rise to 
significant effects on ecological species or 
habitats at the site or in the surrounding area.  
One comment questioned whether the 
Project Site would be returned for nature 
habitat (for birds etc).  
MPL confirm that upon decommissioning, the 
site would be reinstated to a similar condition 
as before construction. Habitat creation would 
take place as part of the development of the 
Project. This is described in the Landscape 
and Ecology Mitigation and Management 
Strategy document (Appendix 11.3 of the ES) 
which includes for the provision of planting and 
pond creation.  
One comment suggests that RSPB should 
be consulted to ensure that the proposed

purposes of the Project. Natural England and 
the relevant local authorities have been

consulted in relation to matters relating to 
potential effects on ecological receptors. 
Chapter 8 of the ES provides an assessment 
of potential effects on breeding birds, which 
concludes that there would be no likely 
significant effects providing mitigation 
measures of timing construction works outside 
of breeding and nesting bird seasons is 
followed.  
One comment recognises that the 
proposed new ponds and planting will 
make a positive contribution to the habitat 
of bird species.  
MPL agrees and considers that no further 
action is required to resolve this comment. 
Health 
17 
Sixteen comments express concern that 
emissions from the operation of the Project 
and increased vehicle movements would 
have an adverse impact on the health of 
the local population. 
MPL acknowledges these comments. A full air 
quality impact assessment has been 
undertaken (Chapter 6 of the ES) and has 
demonstrated no significant air quality effects 
from the Project on human health. The air 
quality assessment has assessed traffic 
movements and given the relatively small 
number and short construction period, no likely 
significant impacts are anticipated. 
One comment questioned if the Project 
can meet air quality standards in 
combination with other projects. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. A full air 
quality impact assessment has been 
undertaken (Chapter 6 of the ES) and has 
included a cumulative assessment of the 
Project operating alongside Covanta. This 
assessment has demonstrated no significant 
air quality effects cumulatively. 
Cumulative impact 
4 
One comment states that the impacts of 
the Project will amplify the impacts of the 
Covanta Project.  
Chapters 6 to 14 of the ES present cumulative 
assessments for each environmental topic 
which clearly assess and present the 
combined impacts of the Project and Covanta. 
One comment questions whether the 
Project will assist in securing the Covanta 
development. 
The Project and the Covanta scheme 
(consented under the RRF Order) are 
independent projects, promoted by separate 
developers. There are interactions between 
the two schemes, e.g. sharing an access, 
which are described in full in Chapter 10 of the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 
5.1). The Project being granted a DCO has no 
bearing on whether the already consented 
Covanta scheme will be constructed or not.  
One comment states that they are 
opposed to the Project on the basis of 
combined impacts from Covanta and the 
Project.  
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapters 6 
to 14 of the ES present cumulative 
assessments for each environmental topic 
which clearly assess and present the 
combined impacts of the Project and Covanta. 
One comment expresses concern that the 
Project may increase the environmental 
burden of existing waste facilities in 
Bedfordshire.  
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapter 15 
of the ES demonstrates that the construction, 
operational and decommissioning phases of 
the Project will generate limited waste and that 
the Project will operate in full accordance with 
the Waste Framework Directive and the Waste 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (where 
relevant). 
Landscape 
8 
One comment states that the Project will 
damage the heritage value of the area. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. A detailed 
assessment has been undertaken of the 
archaeology and cultural heritage of the site 
and surrounding area (Chapter 13 of the ES) 
and has found no likely significant effects 
arising from the Project. 
One comment expresses concern that the 
Project will harm the landscape value of 
the countryside. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. A detailed 
assessment has been undertaken of the 
potential impacts of the Project on landscape 
value (Chapter 11 of the ES) which finds that 
no likely significant effects are anticipated. 
One comment states that there is 
insufficient tree cover to screen the 
Project. 
MPL acknowledges these comments. 
Additional tree planting will take place, as 
outlined in the Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation and Management Strategy 
(Appendix 11.3 of the ES). This has been 
designed to provide additional screening and 
visual mitigation for the Project. 
Three comments state the Project should 
include planting to screen the 
development. 
One comment states that the height of the 
Project is significantly lower than the 
Covanta development. 
MPL acknowledges these comments and 
considers that no further action is required to 
resolve these comments. 
One comment states visual impact is not a 
concern. 
Consultation

Two comments questioned if the 
community consultation undertaken was 
sufficient: 
•

village would not meet the
statutory requirement.
•
The exhibition (in Lidlington) was
not open for long enough to allow
MPL acknowledges these comments. The 
relevant regulations and DCLG Guidance is 
not prescriptive on the format of consultation. 
MPL considers that the approach to 
consultation is proportionate to the scale of the 
Project. CBC and BBC both agreed that the 
Phase 2 Consultation Plan and SoCC provide 
sufficient scope for community engagement as 
evidenced in Appendix 2.C.iv and Appendix 
people working during the day time 
to attend.   
2.C.v of the Consultation Report (Document

One comment expressed that they would 
like to receive further updates on the 
Project.  
MPL propose to set up a Community Liaison 
Group in order for local residents and other 
stakeholders to be kept informed of 
developments with regard to the Project. 
Two comments made suggestions for 
future consultation events:  
•
MPL should provide sealed
envelopes for consultation
feedback forms in future;
•
Provide a comparison on the
various figures
(emissions/vibrations/air quality) to
give greater meaning to the
general public.
MPL acknowledges these comments and will 
take them into consideration when planning 
future consultation exercises.  
Two comments stated that the exhibition 
material provided a clear vision of the 
project and demonstrates that the Project 
has been influenced by previous public 
feedback. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapter 11 
of the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1) demonstrates how feedback 
received from early Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation influenced the format of later 
consultation phases.  
Two comments state that the consultation 
documents provide a thorough 
assessment of the proposals.  
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapter 11 
of the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1) explains how MPL have sought 
to balance the requirement to consult early on 
in the process while providing sufficient 
information to allow consultees to gain a good 
level of understanding about the Project.  
One comment states that they were not 
made aware of the Project during the 
Phase 1 consultation. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapter 6 
of the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1) explains how MPL undertook 
extensive publicity for the Project at the 
national and local level in full accordance with 
the requirements of the PA 2008.  
Socio economics 
6 
Three comments state that the economic 
benefits to the local community will be 
minor. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapter 14 
of the ES identifies that there will be 
opportunities for local construction workers 
(skilled and unskilled) to be involved in the 
Project, which is considered to equate to a 
minor beneficial impact overall. 
One comment questions how the 
estimation that the Project will contribute 
millions of pounds to the local economy 
was calculated. 
The Project would cost in excess of 100 million 
pounds to build, which would include a mix of 
labour, materials, plant and expertise. Some of 
this could be sourced locally. Additionally, the 
construction period of 22 months would 
generate local employment opportunities and 
also have ‘knock on’ financial benefits from 
construction staff spending money within the 
local area on e.g. food and accommodation. 
Further information regarding the methodology 
is set out in Chapter 14 of the ES. 
Three comments regarding local 
employment opportunities: 
•
hope the project will be manned by
local people;
•
surprised it will only take 15
permanent skilled jobs to run &
maintain the facility;
MPL acknowledges these comments. The 
operation of the Project is largely automated, 
hence the relatively low staff numbers needed 
during operation. 
Chapter 14 of the ES identifies that the Project 
will generate the equivalent of 9.2 permanent 
Full-time Equivalent (FTE) construction jobs. 
•
minimal employment opportunities.
Environmental impact 
assessment  
6 
One comment states that the assessment 
does not account for the significant amount 
of new housing development in the area. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. The 
baseline conditions of the assessments carried 
out in Chapters 6 to 15 of the ES have been 
updated to reflect the latest position in terms of 
housing and other developments. The 
cumulative assessment in the ES also takes 
account of new housing that is planned to be 
built in the future.  
Three comments object to the Project on 
the basis of the estimated environmental 
impacts.   
MPL acknowledges these comments. The EIA 
process and Chapters 6 to 15 of the ES have 
been prepared to assess all likely significant 
environmental effects as agreed at the EIA 
Scoping stage of the Project.  
One comment expresses doubt over the 
likely environmental impacts.  
MPL acknowledges this comment. The EIA 
has been undertaken using standard and well 
established best practice assessment 
techniques to ensure that the impacts can be 
estimated with the best possible accuracy.  
One comment states that the assessment 
lifetime of the Project is not stated in the 
consultation material.  
The Project is assumed to have a lifetime of 
25 years. This was stated in Chapter 3 of the 
2017 PEIR.  
Design 
6 
Three comments support the decision to 
reduce the number and/or height of stacks. 
MPL acknowledges these comments and 
considers that no further action is required to 
resolve this comment. 
Two comments state that the design of the 
Project has been improved. 
MPL acknowledges these comments and 
considers that no further action is required to 
resolve this comment. 
One comment suggests that the design 
should be amended to include solar panels 
on the roof of the development. 
MPL acknowledges this comment however 
there is limited roof space available on plant 
items, particularly when maintenance 
requirements are considered, meaning solar 
panels are not feasible in this case. 
Community Benefit 
2 
Two comments state that there will not be 
any benefit to the community.  
As detailed in Chapter 14 of the ES, there are 
considered to be economic benefits arising as 
a result of the Project through increased 
employment opportunities. MPL also propose 
to implement an Education Scheme to support 
local educational establishments (please see 
MPL’s Statement of proposed Heads of Terms 
for an agreement pursuant to s106 Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990  
Policy 
1 
One comment states that the Project will 
need to reflect emerging proposals in the 
Draft Central Beds Local Plan - four new 
villages are planned. 
MPL acknowledges this comment and Chapter 
5 of the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1) demonstrates that regard has 
been had to the Draft Central Beds Local Plan 
as a relevant material consideration. MPL has 
also proactively engaged in the Local Plan 
making process having submitted 
representations to the Council during the Draft 
Central Beds Local Plan Regulation 18 
consultation (July to August 2017). 
Furthermore, additional housing in the area 
will increase demand for electricity locally and 
the Project will potentially assist in meeting 
such additional local demand for electricity. 
Waste 
1 
One comment expresses concern that the 
Project may increase the environmental 
burden of existing waste facilities in 
Bedfordshire. 
MPL acknowledges this comment. Chapter 15 
of the ES demonstrates that the construction, 
operational and decommissioning phases of 
the Project will generate limited waste and that 
the Project will operate in full accordance with 
the Waste Framework Directive and the Waste 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (where 
relevant). 
Other 
24 
MPL received a range of other responses 
from s47 consultees which do not relate to 
any of the main topic themes, these other 
themes include: 
•
Two comments on the Covanta
project;
•
One comment on financial
considerations;
•
Five comments support the Project
generally;
•
Nine comments oppose the Project
generally;
•
Five comments in relation to the
need for the Project; and
•
One comment regarding the
applicant.
MPL considers that the interaction between 
the Project and the Rookery South RRF 
(Covanta) project has been clearly set out 
during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation 
as detailed in Chapter 10 of the CR 
(Document reference 5.1) 
MPL acknowledges that the Project has 
gained support and opposition from the local 
community. Chapters 7 and 9 of the CR 
(Document reference 5.1) provide a summary 
of feedback from the local community from the 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation 
respectively. 
MPL acknowledges the comments on need, 
however the Planning Statement (Document 
reference 10.1) identifies that the need for the 
Project is established in national policy, 
including in NPS EN-1.
