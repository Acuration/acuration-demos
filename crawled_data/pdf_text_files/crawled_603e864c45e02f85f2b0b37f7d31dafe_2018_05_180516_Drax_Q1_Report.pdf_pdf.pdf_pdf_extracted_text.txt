Headlines
This quarter, Britain’s energy system was tested by the Beast from the East: winds 
from Siberia that delivered the coldest March day on record. Article 1 summarises 
the impacts this weather had on the electricity system, and Article 2 looks at 
events on the gas network. The need for heating drove a huge spike in gas demand, 
National Grid issued an emergency warning as supplies failed to keep up with 
demand, and gas storage fell to its lowest levels after Britain’s biggest storage site 
was retired.
The events of March are an interesting glimpse at the future electricity system’s 
resilience. Article 3 looks at how Britain’s interconnectors helped or hindered 
during the time of stress, and whether the system could have coped without coal. 
Britain’s wind farms had another record-breaking quarter, exceeding the output 
of nuclear reactors for the first time (see Article 4). Higher wind speeds and new 
capacity are two reasons that were explored in last quarter's report. Now, Article 5 
shows that the amount of wind energy wasted due to grid constraints has fallen by 
two-thirds, helping to boost output further. 
Together, these events mean that whilst gross electricity demand was up 2% on 
this quarter last year, the demand net of renewables (which had to be met by 
conventional power stations) was 4% lower. Despite the strong switch toward coal 
in March, coal output over the quarter was one-sixth lower than in Q1 2017, and 
consequently carbon emissions were 7% lower. Article 6 finishes with statistics on 
the capacity and production for the quarter.

1. The Beast from the East
March 1st was the coldest spring day on record, 
averaging –3.8°C. This pushed electricity 
demand up 10%, and prices up by 50%. The six 
days from February 26th to March 3rd (highlighted 
in grey) were the coldest Britain has been since 
Christmas 2010.
This pushed electricity demand up 10%, as people 
used more electric heating to keep warm. The 
evening peak demand on March 1st was 53.3 GW: 
the highest in three years, but not enough to 
stretch the system to its limits.
Electricity prices reacted sharply though, peaking 
at £990 per MWh for half an hour, and also falling 
to –£150 per MWh as the market became volatile. 
The average power price in March was 50% higher 
than March 2017 as a result.
Coal generation surged for the weeks surrounding 
the cold spell. Not because more output from 
conventional plants was needed: total generation 
from fossil fuels remained steady, averaging 20–25 
GW. Instead, rising gas prices made it temporarily 
more economical to burn coal. 
Wind output was particularly high when it was 
most needed, ranging from 11.8 to 13.8 GW 
during March 1st. On the other hand, solar panels 
averaged just 0.2 GW on that day, as the blanket of 
snow shielded them from the sun.
Biomass ran solidly throughout the cold spell, 
while two nuclear reactors were down for routine 
maintenance, and seaweed forced a third to shut 
on the coldest day! 
Finally, Electric Insights itself was not immune to 
the cold weather. Traffic to the website surged to 
10 times its usual level on March 1st and 2nd.

2. Running low on gas
The cold weather in March not only affected the power system, Britain’s 
gas network was also stretched as demand outstripped supply. On March 1st, 
National Grid forecast that the amount of gas in pipelines was going to fall below 
the normal operating range. This forced them to trigger the first ‘Gas Deficit 
Warning’ in eight years.
This helped push the spot price of gas to 11.2 p/kWh – compared to an annual 
average of just 1.5 p/kWh. The price increase brought more supplies of gas into the 
system, and persuaded gas power stations to reduce their output, to be replaced 
by cheaper coal. By March 2nd the warning was removed and the spot price of gas 
returned to normal over the next few days.
The shortage was partly due to unusually high demand for gas during the cold 
weather (see chart below). Five in six of Britain’s homes and offices are heated by 
gas.1 On the coldest day (March 1st), daily gas demand spiked to 4,600 GWh, a level 
not seen since 2010. For a sense of scale, the extra gas demand due to the cold 
weather was comparable to the entire country’s electricity demand. 
A further worry for the gas system was the historically low levels of gas held in 
storage. This was not helped by the cold weather coming unusually late into the 
heating season; gas in storage is likely to be at a greater level earlier in the winter 
months. Last year, Britain’s largest inter-seasonal gas storage site (Rough) reached 
the end of its economic life, and was deemed unprofitable. It discharged for the 
last time over winter, and was finally emptied by mid-January.

The UK has historically worked with less gas storage than neighbouring countries, 
as domestic supplies from the North Sea provided a dependable source. This is 
being replaced by imports, including liquid natural gas (LNG) ships which provide 
flexibility in deliveries, at a price. France, Germany and the US typically hold 2–3 
months of gas in storage. In contrast, Britain’s 64 TWh of storage used to satisfy 
just 20 days of demand, but with the closure of Rough this has fallen to around  
25 TWh, or just 8 days of storage. 
The amount of stored gas is at its lowest since 2010 (see chart below). In the week 
surrounding the Beast from the East, 26.7 TWh of gas was consumed, 8.4 TWh of 
which came from storage (see the sharp dip at the start of March). In comparison, 
total electricity demand in that week was just 6 TWh.
The ability of the gas system to accommodate significant swings in energy demand 
over daily, weekly and seasonal timeframes is one of its major strengths. As coal 
continues to be phased out, gas becomes ever-more important for electricity 
generation, as well as heating. Maintaining this flexibility and the ability to cope 
with unusual weather is as critical as ever.

3. Who helped and hindered the system?
Hourly electricity supply from Britain’s interconnectors (top) and coal 
power stations (bottom) over the quarter
How much can Britain rely on its neighbours 
in times of stress? Would the lights have gone 
out if it were not for coal power? The Electric 
Insights data helps us understand who helped, 
and hindered, the power system during the 
extreme weather.
The power flowing over Britain’s links to other 
countries are shown to the right. Britain had 
been largely importing from France all year, but 
began exporting solidly through the 27th and 28th 
of February. France was also experiencing severe 
cold, and a greater share of French homes use 
electric heating. On the two coldest days, Britain 
exported at an average of 0.9 GW (28th, –3.6°C) and 
then imported an average of 1.2 GW (1st, –3.8°C).
Britain imported steadily from the Netherlands, 
and traded power back and forth with Ireland2 to 
help balance both systems. On March 3rd the East-
West link between North Wales and Dublin was 
taken offline for (unrelated) maintenance.
The output from coal during this period dwarfed 
these exchanges with our neighbours (chart below 
right). The cold spell saw the return of ‘king coal’, 
which reverted to being a baseload generator. 
Coal operated solidly day and night for a week as 
high gas prices made it briefly more economical.
The system would likely have coped without this 
coal. 12–19 GW of spare gas capacity was available, 
albeit at a high price. While this means we were 
not short of capacity, if the extra coal output had 
been met by gas, it would have consumed around 
an extra 6 TWh of fuel – more than was available 
in storage by the end of March.
More coal units are going offline as Britain 
moves to a complete phase-out by 2025, meaning 
this source of backup and flexibility will not be 
available for long.

4. Wind power breezes past nuclear
Britain’s wind farms have enjoyed another record-breaking three 
months. Peak output surpassed 14 GW for the first time, and wind 
produced more electricity than nuclear over the quarter. 
Last quarter, wind and solar overtook nuclear generation in Britain, 
but now wind by itself has beaten nuclear for the first time. In the first 
quarter of 2018, wind produced 15,560 GWh of electricity – 30 GWh 
more than nuclear (see chart, right). 
After surpassing 11 GW and 12 GW of peak output last quarter, this 
quarter wind broke through 13 GW on January 17th and then 14 GW on 
March 17th (see chart below).
Britain’s wind farms produced 18.8% of electricity over the quarter, and 
at their peak they supplied 47.3% of the country’s demand (another new 
record). This happened overnight on March 17th, when temperatures 
once again dipped below freezing. There has been much debate on 
whether wind can be relied upon during a cold, calm spell. During the 
six sub-zero days this quarter, wind provided between 12% and 43% of 
electricity demand, operating at a minimum of 4.4 GW.

5. Wind farm curtailment falls by two-thirds
It has been a familiar headline over the years: “Britain’s wind farms paid millions 
to sit idle”. Last year, National Grid paid over £100m to turn wind farms off when 
their output could have overloaded the transmission system. But now that a new 
link between Scotland and Wales has come online, the amount of money (and clean 
energy) that was lost has quietly fallen by two-thirds.
Power stations can only sell their output if the electricity can be handled by 
the transmission grid, otherwise they have to be ‘constrained’ off. Nationwide, 
constraints have risen from almost nothing five years ago to over 5% of wind 
generation (see chart, below).3 This is not a problem unique to Britain though, 
constraint rates average 4–5% in Germany and 12–15% in China, with some Chinese 
provinces seeing 40% of wind generation lost.4
Wind constraints are a particular problem in Scotland, where 7.7 GW of wind capacity 
feeds a demand that averages just 3 GW. Until recently there were only three lines 
connecting Scotland to England and Northern Ireland, totalling around 3.25 GW. This 
helps to explain why a sixth of Scotland’s available wind energy was lost in 2015/16, 
with curtailment rates of up to 30% at individual farms.4 Seven Scottish wind farms 
accounted for half of all the wind energy constrained across Britain.
The share of wind energy lost to curtailment in Britain. A new transmission link between 
Scotland and Wales came online in December 2017. Curtailment is often higher in summer 
months when demand is lower, as high wind output becomes harder to manage.

 We measure this against transmission-connected wind output. Constraints in the ‘embedded’ wind farms  
(smaller farms and those in England & Wales) are not monitored, or paid for.

Wind farms are not the only type of power station to be constrained, but they 
matter because reducing their output costs money, rather than saving it. Wind 
farms lose their subsidy payments if they are forced to turn off, so they request 
payment from National Grid as compensation. The average wind farm charged  
£69/MWh to be curtailed in 2017, a price which has halved in the last four years.
 
Since 2012, National Grid has spent over £380 million on constraining wind farms: 
around £1 per person per year. The cost has risen in line with the amount of wind 
generation: once wind had reached 4 percent of Britain’s electricity supply, each 
additional percent of wind energy added £1m per month to the cost of constraint 
payments (see chart, below).
However, this trend appears to have been broken, as the payments this quarter 
were the lowest since Q1 2013, despite wind production more than doubling since 
then. In December 2017 the ‘Western HVDC Link’ came online, a new 2.2 GW cable 
connecting Scotland to North Wales.5 The £1bn link was built in the Irish Sea rather 
than on land, to minimise visual impact.
From the figure below, a crude estimate is that this link saved National Grid around 
£9m per month during Quarter 1 on constraint payments. These savings could pay 
back the construction cost in under 10 years if they continued. The benefits are 
not just financial though – if we could have utilised all of Scotland’s wind power 
last year by eliminating grid constraints, the annual capacity factor of Scottish 
wind farms would have improved by a sixth, from 27% to 32%.

6. Capacity and production statistics
This quarter, wind was the second largest source of electricity behind gas. Renewables made up 
26% of the generation mix, and all low carbon sources made up 49%. Generation from coal and 
gas were both down on this quarter last year due to the growth in renewable energy output.
Gross electricity demand was a tenth lower than in the first quarter of 2010. Demand net of 
renewables was down by 27% though, indicating just how the market for fossil fuels is shrinking.
Electricity prices averaged £54/MWh over the quarter, one-sixth higher than last year.  
The real-time cash out price fell below its previous minimum of –£100/MWh on three 
occasions. Prices hit –£130 to –£150/MWh in periods when wind and coal output was  
high, and gas output was low.

6 Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider.  For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 900 MW of wind, 
600 MW of biomass and 500 MW of solar, respectively producing 1.4, 1.2 and 0.2 TWh extra per quarter. These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity 
system and so cannot be reported on here.
